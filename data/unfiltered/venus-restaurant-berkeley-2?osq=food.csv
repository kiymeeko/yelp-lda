0,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
1,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
2,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too. Great place to visit with a friend from out of town or if you're just up for something new. The Americanos are always on point! Strong but not bitter. And if you'd looking for the best ""deal,"" they have a breakfast sando for $10"
3,"This is a great spot for brunch in downtown Berkeley.  My friend and I came here during a weekday and the place was packed.  It's a small joint, so tables are really close to one another, and when you're seated, the hostess actually pulls out the table so the person sitting at the booth to the back of the wall can climb in.  Be prepared to get cozy here.  The menu has a great list of classic items, including more intriguing ones that have an Indian-esque flavor.  We later learned that Venus' sister restaurant is Tigerlily where you can get Tikka Masala Chicken and Waffles!  But here, I ended up getting the Warm Poached Egg Salad and added for four dollars, Indian-spiced bacon!  Our food didn't take too long to get, and once it came out it smelled and looks delicious.  My salad was solid, and reminded me of a heartier frisee salad, with the warm poached egg and bites of bacon pieces throughout the salad.  The egg was cooked perfectly, and loved the abundance of spring mix you get!  But have to say that I was disappointed by the bacon, as I could not taste any Indian flavor to it.  It was good, but seemed like a standard, thick-cut bacon chopped into pieces.  It made for a nice crunch for the salad and did like it, but really could not taste any kind of curry or spice to it.  However, the salad also came with bread which had a really yummy olive tapenade on it!  The portion was a large size, so didn't end up finishing for brunch.  But overall, it's a good entree to get, especially if you're looking to load up on greens.  Venus made for a nice brunch despite being able to hear both of the tables next to us for most of the time.  After visiting here I'll have to check out Tigerlily for when I'm in Berkeley again."
4,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
5,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
6,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
7,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
8,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
9,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
10,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
11,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
12,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
13,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
14,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
15,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
16,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
17,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
18,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
19,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"

43,"This is a great spot for brunch in downtown Berkeley.  My friend and I came here during a weekday and the place was packed.  It's a small joint, so tables are really close to one another, and when you're seated, the hostess actually pulls out the table so the person sitting at the booth to the back of the wall can climb in.  Be prepared to get cozy here.  The menu has a great list of classic items, including more intriguing ones that have an Indian-esque flavor.  We later learned that Venus' sister restaurant is Tigerlily where you can get Tikka Masala Chicken and Waffles!  But here, I ended up getting the Warm Poached Egg Salad and added for four dollars, Indian-spiced bacon!  Our food didn't take too long to get, and once it came out it smelled and looks delicious.  My salad was solid, and reminded me of a heartier frisee salad, with the warm poached egg and bites of bacon pieces throughout the salad.  The egg was cooked perfectly, and loved the abundance of spring mix you get!  But have to say that I was disappointed by the bacon, as I could not taste any Indian flavor to it.  It was good, but seemed like a standard, thick-cut bacon chopped into pieces.  It made for a nice crunch for the salad and did like it, but really could not taste any kind of curry or spice to it.  However, the salad also came with bread which had a really yummy olive tapenade on it!  The portion was a large size, so didn't end up finishing for brunch.  But overall, it's a good entree to get, especially if you're looking to load up on greens.  Venus made for a nice brunch despite being able to hear both of the tables next to us for most of the time.  After visiting here I'll have to check out Tigerlily for when I'm in Berkeley again."
44,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
45,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
46,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
47,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
48,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
49,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
50,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
51,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
52,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
53,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
54,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
55,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
56,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
57,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
58,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
59,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
60,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
61,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
62,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

84,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
85,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
86,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
87,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
88,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
89,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
90,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
91,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
92,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
93,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
94,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
95,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
96,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
97,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
98,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
99,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
100,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
101,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
102,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

124,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
125,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
126,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
127,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
128,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
129,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
130,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
131,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
132,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
133,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
134,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
135,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
136,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
137,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
138,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
139,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
140,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
141,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
142,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

164,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
165,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
166,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
167,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
168,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
169,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
170,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
171,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
172,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
173,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
174,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
175,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
176,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
177,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
178,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
179,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
180,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
181,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
182,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

204,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
205,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
206,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
207,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
208,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
209,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
210,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
211,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
212,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
213,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
214,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
215,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
216,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
217,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
218,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
219,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
220,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
221,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
222,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

244,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
245,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
246,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
247,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
248,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
249,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
250,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
251,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
252,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
253,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
254,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
255,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
256,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
257,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
258,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
259,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
260,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
261,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
262,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

284,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
285,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
286,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
287,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
288,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
289,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
290,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
291,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
292,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
293,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
294,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
295,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
296,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
297,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
298,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
299,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
300,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
301,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
302,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

324,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
325,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
326,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
327,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
328,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
329,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
330,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
331,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
332,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
333,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
334,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
335,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
336,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
337,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
338,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
339,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
340,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
341,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
342,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

364,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
365,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
366,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
367,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
368,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
369,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
370,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
371,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
372,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
373,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
374,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
375,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
376,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
377,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
378,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
379,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
380,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
381,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
382,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

404,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
405,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
406,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
407,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
408,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
409,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
410,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
411,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
412,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
413,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
414,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
415,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
416,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
417,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
418,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
419,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
420,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
421,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
422,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

444,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
445,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
446,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
447,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
448,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
449,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
450,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
451,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
452,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
453,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
454,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
455,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
456,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
457,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
458,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
459,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
460,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
461,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
462,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

484,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
485,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
486,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
487,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
488,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
489,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
490,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
491,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
492,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
493,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
494,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
495,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
496,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
497,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
498,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
499,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
500,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
501,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
502,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

524,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
525,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
526,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
527,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
528,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
529,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
530,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
531,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
532,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
533,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
534,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
535,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
536,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
537,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
538,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
539,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
540,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
541,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
542,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

564,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
565,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
566,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
567,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
568,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
569,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
570,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
571,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
572,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
573,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
574,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
575,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
576,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
577,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
578,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
579,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
580,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
581,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
582,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

604,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
605,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
606,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
607,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
608,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
609,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
610,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
611,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
612,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
613,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
614,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
615,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
616,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
617,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
618,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
619,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
620,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
621,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
622,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

644,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
645,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
646,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
647,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
648,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
649,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
650,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
651,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
652,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
653,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
654,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
655,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
656,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
657,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
658,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
659,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
660,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
661,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
662,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

684,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
685,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
686,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
687,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
688,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
689,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
690,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
691,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
692,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
693,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
694,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
695,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
696,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
697,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
698,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
699,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
700,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
701,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
702,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

724,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
725,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
726,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
727,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
728,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
729,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
730,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
731,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
732,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
733,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
734,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
735,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
736,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
737,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
738,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
739,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
740,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
741,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
742,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

764,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
765,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
766,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
767,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
768,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
769,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
770,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
771,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
772,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
773,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
774,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
775,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
776,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
777,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
778,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
779,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
780,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
781,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
782,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

804,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
805,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
806,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
807,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
808,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
809,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
810,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
811,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
812,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
813,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
814,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
815,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
816,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
817,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
818,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
819,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
820,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
821,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
822,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

844,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
845,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
846,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
847,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
848,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
849,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
850,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
851,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
852,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
853,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
854,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
855,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
856,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
857,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
858,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
859,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
860,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
861,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
862,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

884,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
885,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
886,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
887,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
888,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
889,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
890,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
891,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
892,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
893,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
894,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
895,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
896,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
897,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
898,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
899,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
900,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
901,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars).

902,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

924,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
925,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
926,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
927,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
928,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
929,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
930,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
931,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
932,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
933,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
934,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
935,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
936,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
937,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
938,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
939,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
940,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
941,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
942,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too. Great place to visit with a friend from out of town or if you're just up for something new. The Americanos are always on point! Strong but not bitter.

964,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
965,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
966,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
967,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
968,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
969,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
970,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
971,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
972,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
973,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
974,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
975,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
976,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
977,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
978,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
979,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
980,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
981,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
982,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too. Great place to visit with a friend from out of town or if you're just up for something new. The Americanos are always on point! Strong but not bitter.

1004,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
1005,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
1006,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
1007,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
1008,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
1009,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
1010,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
1011,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
1012,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
1013,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
1014,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
1015,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
1016,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
1017,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
1018,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
1019,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
1020,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
1021,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
1022,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too. Great place to visit with a friend from out of town or if you're just up for something new. The Americanos are always on point! Strong but not bitter.

1043,"This is a great spot for brunch in downtown Berkeley.  My friend and I came here during a weekday and the place was packed.  It's a small joint, so tables are really close to one another, and when you're seated, the hostess actually pulls out the table so the person sitting at the booth to the back of the wall can climb in.  Be prepared to get cozy here.  The menu has a great list of classic items, including more intriguing ones that have an Indian-esque flavor.  We later learned that Venus' sister restaurant is Tigerlily where you can get Tikka Masala Chicken and Waffles!  But here, I ended up getting the Warm Poached Egg Salad and added for four dollars, Indian-spiced bacon!  Our food didn't take too long to get, and once it came out it smelled and looks delicious.  My salad was solid, and reminded me of a heartier frisee salad, with the warm poached egg and bites of bacon pieces throughout the salad.  The egg was cooked perfectly, and loved the abundance of spring mix you get!  But have to say that I was disappointed by the bacon, as I could not taste any Indian flavor to it.  It was good, but seemed like a standard, thick-cut bacon chopped into pieces.  It made for a nice crunch for the salad and did like it, but really could not taste any kind of curry or spice to it.  However, the salad also came with bread which had a really yummy olive tapenade on it!  The portion was a large size, so didn't end up finishing for brunch.  But overall, it's a good entree to get, especially if you're looking to load up on greens.  Venus made for a nice brunch despite being able to hear both of the tables next to us for most of the time.  After visiting here I'll have to check out Tigerlily for when I'm in Berkeley again."
1044,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
1045,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
1046,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
1047,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
1048,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
1049,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
1050,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
1051,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
1052,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
1053,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
1054,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
1055,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
1056,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
1057,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
1058,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
1059,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
1060,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
1061,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
1062,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

1083,"This is a great spot for brunch in downtown Berkeley.  My friend and I came here during a weekday and the place was packed.  It's a small joint, so tables are really close to one another, and when you're seated, the hostess actually pulls out the table so the person sitting at the booth to the back of the wall can climb in.  Be prepared to get cozy here.  The menu has a great list of classic items, including more intriguing ones that have an Indian-esque flavor.  We later learned that Venus' sister restaurant is Tigerlily where you can get Tikka Masala Chicken and Waffles!  But here, I ended up getting the Warm Poached Egg Salad and added for four dollars, Indian-spiced bacon!  Our food didn't take too long to get, and once it came out it smelled and looks delicious.  My salad was solid, and reminded me of a heartier frisee salad, with the warm poached egg and bites of bacon pieces throughout the salad.  The egg was cooked perfectly, and loved the abundance of spring mix you get!  But have to say that I was disappointed by the bacon, as I could not taste any Indian flavor to it.  It was good, but seemed like a standard, thick-cut bacon chopped into pieces.  It made for a nice crunch for the salad and did like it, but really could not taste any kind of curry or spice to it.  However, the salad also came with bread which had a really yummy olive tapenade on it!  The portion was a large size, so didn't end up finishing for brunch.  But overall, it's a good entree to get, especially if you're looking to load up on greens.  Venus made for a nice brunch despite being able to hear both of the tables next to us for most of the time.  After visiting here I'll have to check out Tigerlily for when I'm in Berkeley again."
1084,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
1085,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
1086,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
1087,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
1088,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
1089,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
1090,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
1091,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
1092,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
1093,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
1094,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
1095,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
1096,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
1097,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
1098,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
1099,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
1100,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
1101,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
1102,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

1123,"This is a great spot for brunch in downtown Berkeley.  My friend and I came here during a weekday and the place was packed.  It's a small joint, so tables are really close to one another, and when you're seated, the hostess actually pulls out the table so the person sitting at the booth to the back of the wall can climb in.  Be prepared to get cozy here.  The menu has a great list of classic items, including more intriguing ones that have an Indian-esque flavor.  We later learned that Venus' sister restaurant is Tigerlily where you can get Tikka Masala Chicken and Waffles!  But here, I ended up getting the Warm Poached Egg Salad and added for four dollars, Indian-spiced bacon!  Our food didn't take too long to get, and once it came out it smelled and looks delicious.  My salad was solid, and reminded me of a heartier frisee salad, with the warm poached egg and bites of bacon pieces throughout the salad.  The egg was cooked perfectly, and loved the abundance of spring mix you get!  But have to say that I was disappointed by the bacon, as I could not taste any Indian flavor to it.  It was good, but seemed like a standard, thick-cut bacon chopped into pieces.  It made for a nice crunch for the salad and did like it, but really could not taste any kind of curry or spice to it.  However, the salad also came with bread which had a really yummy olive tapenade on it!  The portion was a large size, so didn't end up finishing for brunch.  But overall, it's a good entree to get, especially if you're looking to load up on greens.  Venus made for a nice brunch despite being able to hear both of the tables next to us for most of the time.  After visiting here I'll have to check out Tigerlily for when I'm in Berkeley again."
1124,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
1125,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
1126,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
1127,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
1128,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
1129,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
1130,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
1131,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
1132,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
1133,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
1134,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
1135,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
1136,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
1137,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
1138,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
1139,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
1140,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
1141,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
1142,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

1163,"This is a great spot for brunch in downtown Berkeley.  My friend and I came here during a weekday and the place was packed.  It's a small joint, so tables are really close to one another, and when you're seated, the hostess actually pulls out the table so the person sitting at the booth to the back of the wall can climb in.  Be prepared to get cozy here.  The menu has a great list of classic items, including more intriguing ones that have an Indian-esque flavor.  We later learned that Venus' sister restaurant is Tigerlily where you can get Tikka Masala Chicken and Waffles!  But here, I ended up getting the Warm Poached Egg Salad and added for four dollars, Indian-spiced bacon!  Our food didn't take too long to get, and once it came out it smelled and looks delicious.  My salad was solid, and reminded me of a heartier frisee salad, with the warm poached egg and bites of bacon pieces throughout the salad.  The egg was cooked perfectly, and loved the abundance of spring mix you get!  But have to say that I was disappointed by the bacon, as I could not taste any Indian flavor to it.  It was good, but seemed like a standard, thick-cut bacon chopped into pieces.  It made for a nice crunch for the salad and did like it, but really could not taste any kind of curry or spice to it.  However, the salad also came with bread which had a really yummy olive tapenade on it!  The portion was a large size, so didn't end up finishing for brunch.  But overall, it's a good entree to get, especially if you're looking to load up on greens.  Venus made for a nice brunch despite being able to hear both of the tables next to us for most of the time.  After visiting here I'll have to check out Tigerlily for when I'm in Berkeley again."
1164,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
1165,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
1166,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
1167,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
1168,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
1169,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
1170,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
1171,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
1172,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
1173,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
1174,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
1175,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
1176,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
1177,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
1178,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
1179,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
1180,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
1181,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
1182,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

1203,"This is a great spot for brunch in downtown Berkeley.  My friend and I came here during a weekday and the place was packed.  It's a small joint, so tables are really close to one another, and when you're seated, the hostess actually pulls out the table so the person sitting at the booth to the back of the wall can climb in.  Be prepared to get cozy here.  The menu has a great list of classic items, including more intriguing ones that have an Indian-esque flavor.  We later learned that Venus' sister restaurant is Tigerlily where you can get Tikka Masala Chicken and Waffles!  But here, I ended up getting the Warm Poached Egg Salad and added for four dollars, Indian-spiced bacon!  Our food didn't take too long to get, and once it came out it smelled and looks delicious.  My salad was solid, and reminded me of a heartier frisee salad, with the warm poached egg and bites of bacon pieces throughout the salad.  The egg was cooked perfectly, and loved the abundance of spring mix you get!  But have to say that I was disappointed by the bacon, as I could not taste any Indian flavor to it.  It was good, but seemed like a standard, thick-cut bacon chopped into pieces.  It made for a nice crunch for the salad and did like it, but really could not taste any kind of curry or spice to it.  However, the salad also came with bread which had a really yummy olive tapenade on it!  The portion was a large size, so didn't end up finishing for brunch.  But overall, it's a good entree to get, especially if you're looking to load up on greens.  Venus made for a nice brunch despite being able to hear both of the tables next to us for most of the time.  After visiting here I'll have to check out Tigerlily for when I'm in Berkeley again."
1204,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
1205,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
1206,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
1207,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
1208,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
1209,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
1210,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
1211,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
1212,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
1213,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
1214,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
1215,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
1216,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
1217,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
1218,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
1219,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
1220,Another first time experience. Environment was welcoming and very clean. It's a little tight on space is a draw back. You are on top of each other but hey I get it space is a premium in Berkeley. Staff was friendly and very quick to serve you. Food was good. You can tell it's made fresh with fresh ingredients. Pancakes light does not make you feel overly full. I love crispy bacon they cooked it perfectly for me. Egg over medium cooked just right. Biscuits were really soft however the gravy did not have any flavor- tasted bland. A little pricey so be prepared for that. Overall worth the trip.
1221,"I have been a customer of Venus for many years.  Since the change in management, the food has thankfully remained excellent (4 stars). Sadly, I can't say the same about the service, which used to be friendly, welcoming, prompt, and attentive.  Now the servers are all rushing around frantically with unhappy looks on their faces and it's difficult to get one's attention if you need something.  When I was there recently for breakfast, several customers were even made to move our tables over several inches (when tables were aleady packed in like sardines) so one more table could be put into service.  In addition to this, the staff are all being paid more than in the past, due to Berkeley's increasing minimum wage -  soon to reach $15/hr in Oct 2018 (and which I support).  This however means escalating menu prices, on top of which customers are still expected to tip -- ??   So for me -- goodbye, Venus."
1222,"I've visited Venus about 5 or 6 times over a few years. This restaurant is related to its sister facility in North Berkeley, Tigerlilly (great fried chicken and drinks). Venus is more brunch-oriented American-Indian (India) fusion food.Venus isn't cheap, but neither is the experience. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so good. The curry egg veggie plate is solid too.

1243,"This is a great spot for brunch in downtown Berkeley.  My friend and I came here during a weekday and the place was packed.  It's a small joint, so tables are really close to one another, and when you're seated, the hostess actually pulls out the table so the person sitting at the booth to the back of the wall can climb in.  Be prepared to get cozy here.  The menu has a great list of classic items, including more intriguing ones that have an Indian-esque flavor.  We later learned that Venus' sister restaurant is Tigerlily where you can get Tikka Masala Chicken and Waffles!  But here, I ended up getting the Warm Poached Egg Salad and added for four dollars, Indian-spiced bacon!  Our food didn't take too long to get, and once it came out it smelled and looks delicious.  My salad was solid, and reminded me of a heartier frisee salad, with the warm poached egg and bites of bacon pieces throughout the salad.  The egg was cooked perfectly, and loved the abundance of spring mix you get!  But have to say that I was disappointed by the bacon, as I could not taste any Indian flavor to it.  It was good, but seemed like a standard, thick-cut bacon chopped into pieces.  It made for a nice crunch for the salad and did like it, but really could not taste any kind of curry or spice to it.  However, the salad also came with bread which had a really yummy olive tapenade on it!  The portion was a large size, so didn't end up finishing for brunch.  But overall, it's a good entree to get, especially if you're looking to load up on greens.  Venus made for a nice brunch despite being able to hear both of the tables next to us for most of the time.  After visiting here I'll have to check out Tigerlily for when I'm in Berkeley again."
1244,"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Berkeley! The portion is not too big so I feel healthier.The inside of the restaurant is not too big so I wouldn't go with bunch of people, but it's good for coffee chat with your partner or small group of people."
1245,"Our server was amazing, really attentive and concerned with making sure we got exactly what we wanted to eat. My daughter wanted a bowl of fruit, but she is picky about what fruit she likes, and the waitress wanted to make sure she just got the fruit she wanted, and she even brought an extra plate for her to pick around anything she didn't like. My son and I got the country breakfast, and it was delicious.  I felt like the biscuit was a little dry, but my son soaked up the jam with it and loved it. Eggs were perfectly fluffy. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite part.  Perfectly cooked. Just crispy enough. Everything was super delicious. Pomegranate mimosa was amazing.  The fresh juices were a little pricey, but tasty."
1246,Venus is the ideal place to enjoy a special breakfast. Chef Amy is well-known in the East Bay and he has never let me down; I have followed her through the years and she continues to amaze me. I constantly bring people to either Venus and Revival and my guests have always been very impressed with the food and service. Last time I was there with my niece and bother in law I had the Royale Omelette and I shared the French Toast with the girl. She never eats much but she was so happy that wanted to order more food.I have been to Venus a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed. They employees are warm and make me feel welcome. Their kindness might sound like a small detail but it does make a difference when the staff treat guests that way day after day. The place is too good to stop coming at least once a month.
1247,"I have been here twice. Twice I have been disappointed. First time: super excited to try Venus, got the Venus Benedict. First bite was delicious, but afterwards to just didn't have the same oomph. It came with two eggs and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were hard, cold, and not well seasoned. I only ate the eggs Benedict and didn't finish the potatoes, but felt so bloated afterwards. Also waited about an hour and a half, should've just gone to la note. Was very disappointed. Second time: gave Venus another try to grab brunch and catch up with a friend. Felt like I had to tell across the small table to be heard. $15 for 2x2x2, not worth. Probably could've gotten the same thing, but better at another diner for $10. Only bright side was there was no wait this time. TLDR; There will probably be no next time. Will just wait it out at la note."
1248,"It's my first time in and was interested in the Venus Benedict. I was not a fan. The potatoes, spinach and tomato had a very strong lemon flavor which I was not a fan of.Customer service was normal.Make sure to check your bill as I got charged someone else's bill and had to be corrected. Not sure that I will return."
1249,"Venus would be decent enough for brunch if it weren't for a whole series of shortcomings. The chicken sausage scramble, for example, was lukewarm by the time it came out, and while I appreciate the emphasis on fresh fare made from scratch, the whole equation wasn't a lot more flavorful or inventive than what one could make at home. Moreover, my first dish and silverware were taken from me when done, without any attempt to ask if I wanted anything else. Then, when I did want something else, the server seemed rather irritated about having to do anything more. Furthermore, I had to ask for silverware and napkins again when my extra dish came, which was met with more silent irritation. As if I could just eat with my bare hands and wipe myself off with my shirt. Here's hoping the new ownership injects some new energy into this long-established joint."
1250,"Great brunch the day after my daughter's graduation from Cal.  Nice wood tables, comfortable ambience, great service, and everyone LOVED all the food!! Even us Martians."
1251,Came to eat here with my friend and I. Our waitress (Aurora) did not pay to much attention to our orders. We ordered two bloody Mary's one that was virgin. They brought both with alcohol. I ordered the kale salad with avocado and parmesan on it. She brought my plate and it had no avocado or parmesan on it. I did not send it back I was to hungry to wait any longer for the food. The salad was amazing the salmon was cooked perfect. Our waitress some how got lost in space or Venus because she didn't bother to come back to our table to check up on us. We had to ask someone else to get our bill. Then she happened to pop up and give us our bill. It's small inside they were busy I went during brunch.
1252,"I was in Norcal with my family for Christmas vacation and found this place on Yelp when we were deciding on where to get breakfast. We came on the Monday after Christmas. It's a pretty small restaurant so we had to wait a while to get seated, as is expected with any good brunch place. The interesting thing about this place is that they have a no-tip service model. The menu prices reflect the complete cost of product and service, so you don't pay any additional tip afterwards. However, looking at the prices of the food, it's pretty comparable to other brunch places pre-tip, so not a bad deal!I'm a huge benedict fan so I was going to get the Venus Benedict. However, I looked at their specials board and noticed they had a crab benedict, which sounded much more appealing. I've had crab cake benedicts before but never a purely crab benedict, so I was intrigued. It ended up being delicious! There was a good amount of crab in my benedict and it paired nicely with the hollandaise sauce. I definitely prefer actual pieces of crab over a crab cake.Their coffee also tastes great!I definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the Berkeley area!"
1253,"Order their chicken sausage scramble & lemon ricotta pancakes! Although the home fries on their scramble could have been more seasoned, the scramble was flavorful and filling! However, I honestly felt that the highlight of the dish was the side biscuit (not sure if that's good or not... considering that the scramble should have taken the spotlight since that's what the dish is called...)! I remember cutting open the biscuit with my knife. The crunch of the biscuit added some resistance, but after it was cut open, the steamy hot biscuit opened up in half instantly. The jam melted as I spread it onto the surface of the biscuit. It was so delicious! I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes to see what everyone was raving about, and I have to say that it is a must try! You can order individual pancakes for 1/3 of the price. The pancakes came with maple syrup, lemon butter, and blueberry sauce. The combinations of flavors kept me wanting the pancake bite after bite. Must order!"
1254,"Our server was pleasant and open to answering our (many) questions. She also tipped us on the sizes of the orders: small plates are appetizer-sized (quite small)  and large plates are very large. You'll get a better deal if you order the large plates. I ordered the kale salad ($15.40 with tax) and found it nice and fully dressed. I love lime so this was a win in my book. The pomegranate, pumpkins seeds, and squash were cute touches. Albeit rather overpriced, Venus is a spot to get some interesting fusions (I spotted some Korean and Indian cuisine-inspired dishes on the menu too). I'll be back!"
1255,"Downtown Berkeley has many staple brunch offerings - La Note, Gather, Sunnyside, Saturn, all minutes within each other so it can be hard to pick your next brunch spot. To reserve a table at Gather, wait the line out at La Note, or just grab something at Sunnyside? Venus is a nice alternative, for those looking for something a bit cheaper than La Note, but still delicious.Venus is cramped. Bustling with people coming in, and out, this isn't the place to have a quiet, conversation. But it's crowded for a reason: the food is really good. Offering a selection of omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options, along with a couple of boozy drinks, Venus is a pretty solid casual brunch/lunch spot for anyone and everyone.I opted for the vegan tofu scramble, tofu, veggies, potatoes, and some bread. For some reason I expected the tofu scramble to attempt to imitate scrambled eggs, but it didn't and held its own as a savory stir fry dish. The tofu seemed marinated in something vinegary, accompanied by lots of yummy veggies lightly coated in a sort of soy/tamari sauce. Very savory, and very good, just not your typical brunch go-to.To sum, a solid, vegan friendly brunch spot.[Yelp 2017 2/100]"
1256,"The owners let it go to the ground and now sold it, I came in, it felt very dirty, plus the menus were super dirty The plastic cover them coming undone, $15 for eggs with Indian spice bacon? Why would I want my bacon to taste like Indian spices? There is a dirty Indian restaurant next door (That I have never been or will) for that matter I can go there and have ""Indian"" spice food. I am sorry to sound so upset this used to be my favorite place :( so I got up and went to La Note instead they still awesome, wholesome and no weird ingredients.I would give this place a 0 minus if I could."
1257,"A and I started our Berkeley day trip at Venus this past weekend and it really set the tone for our day. We arrived off BART at Venus at around 9AM and were ready for some good breakfast. Luckily, we did not have to wait but by the time we left at ~9:30, people were waiting for a table. As other reviews have mentioned, Venus REALLY packs people in so don't expect any privacy in your conversation.I ordered a coffee (really good!) and the Autumn Scramble which came with a Morning Glory Muffin and a side of greens ($14.95). A got the 2x2x2 ($14.50) with pancakes, homemade sausage and scrambled eggs. Something to note is that the prices are a bit higher than your average brunch spot but this is inclusive of service so it evens out. Anyways, our food came really quickly and we dug in.I really enjoyed my Autumn Scramble and the vegetables and goat cheese inside. It was hearty without being greasy or too filling. The Morning Glory muffin that came with it was DELIGHTFUL. I have never been anywhere that will give you the option of a muffin in place of toast for no extra charge so this was great. The side of greens that came with it was a perfect way to round out the plate. I feel like potatoes would have been too much and fruit would not have gone really well with the rest of the meal. I will say that my coffee was not refilled once, even though it was empty before I began eating which is a pet peeve of mine. Especially since it is the norm EVERYWHERE to give refills on coffee at breakfast. Regardless, A really enjoyed his 2x2x2, especially the homemade sausage. I thought the pancakes were great as they weren't too sweet but they weren't fully up A's ally.While we enjoyed our food, I would definitely try other places in Berkeley before returning. I would like to come back for dinner, however, since the menu has so many tempting options."
1258,"The harajuku scramble is special. I was doubtful, but they managed to make a carnivore like me enjoy eating a vegetarian dish. However, they skimped on the country breakfast. Look at this sorry dollop of sour cream...."
1259,"Great place for brunch in the downtown area! If you're not excited about waiting in line at La Note this is a great alternative. Location: On shattuck so super convenient to get to but parking is always rough in this area. The place itself is a hole in the wall with few tables. We got seated fairly quickly, but my peeve is that the table was too close to the ones next to us so I felt like I was invading other peoples' conversation/it was difficult to get in and out. Food: I got the benedict and shared the pork chop with apple with my friend. The benedict itself tasted delish but the presentation was lacking. It paired well with their homestyle fries though. The pork chop was good as well but I felt that it was a tad overcooked. Overall, the food tasted well and filled both of us up!"
