0,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
1,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
2,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
3,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
4,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
5,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
6,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
7,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
8,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
9,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
10,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
11,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
12,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
13,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
14,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
15,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
16,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
17,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
18,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
19,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"

I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
43,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
44,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
45,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
46,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
47,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
48,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
49,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
50,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
51,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
52,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
53,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
54,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
55,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
56,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
57,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
58,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
59,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
60,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
61,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."

If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
84,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
85,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
86,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
87,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
88,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
89,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
90,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
91,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
92,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
93,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
94,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
95,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
96,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
97,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
98,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
99,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
100,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
101,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
102,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"

The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
126,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
127,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
128,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
129,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
130,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
131,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
132,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
133,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
134,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
135,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
136,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
137,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
138,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
139,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
140,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
141,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
142,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
143,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
144,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."

166,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
167,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
168,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
169,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
170,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
171,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
172,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
173,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
174,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
175,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
176,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
177,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
178,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
179,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
180,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
181,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
182,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
183,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
184,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
185,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place.

We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries.

The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
208,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
209,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
210,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
211,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
212,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
213,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
214,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
215,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
216,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
217,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
218,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
219,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
220,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
221,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
222,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
223,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
224,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
225,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."

The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
248,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
249,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
250,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
251,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
252,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
253,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
254,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
255,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
256,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
257,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
258,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
259,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
260,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
261,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
262,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
263,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
264,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
265,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
266,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
267,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume.

Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
290,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
291,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
292,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
293,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
294,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
295,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
296,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
297,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
298,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
299,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
300,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
301,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
302,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
303,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
304,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
305,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
306,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
307,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
308,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."

331,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
332,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
333,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
334,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
335,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
336,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
337,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
338,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
339,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
340,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
341,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
342,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
343,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
344,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
345,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
346,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
347,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
348,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
349,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned.

There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
372,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
373,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
374,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
375,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
376,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
377,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
378,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
379,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
380,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
381,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
382,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
383,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
384,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
385,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
386,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
387,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
388,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
389,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved!

390,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
391,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it).

413,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
414,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
415,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
416,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
417,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
418,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
419,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
420,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
421,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
422,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
423,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
424,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
425,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
426,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
427,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
428,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
429,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
430,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
431,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
432,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here!

Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
455,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
456,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
457,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
458,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
459,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
460,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
461,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
462,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
463,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
464,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
465,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
466,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
467,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
468,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
469,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
470,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
471,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
472,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
473,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"

I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
496,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
497,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
498,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
499,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
500,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
501,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
502,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
503,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
504,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
505,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
506,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
507,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
508,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
509,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
510,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
511,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
512,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
513,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
514,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."

However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
537,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
538,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
539,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
540,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
541,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
542,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
543,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
544,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
545,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
546,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
547,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
548,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
549,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
550,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
551,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
552,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
553,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
554,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
555,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."

The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
578,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
579,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
580,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
581,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
582,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
583,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
584,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
585,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
586,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
587,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
588,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
589,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
590,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
591,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
592,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
593,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
594,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
595,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
596,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
597,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion?

620,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
621,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
622,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
623,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
624,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
625,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
626,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
627,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
628,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
629,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
630,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
631,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
632,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
633,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
634,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
635,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
636,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
637,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
638,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu.

Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
662,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
663,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
664,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
665,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
666,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
667,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
668,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
669,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
670,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
671,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
672,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
673,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
674,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
675,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
676,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
677,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
678,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
679,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
680,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
681,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot.

If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
703,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
704,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
705,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
706,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
707,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
708,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
709,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
710,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
711,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
712,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
713,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
714,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
715,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
716,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
717,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
718,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
719,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
720,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
721,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
722,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try.

However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
744,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
745,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
746,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
747,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
748,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
749,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
750,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
751,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
752,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
753,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
754,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
755,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
756,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
757,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
758,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
759,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
760,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
761,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
762,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
763,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches!

We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
786,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
787,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
788,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
789,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
790,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
791,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
792,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
793,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
794,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
795,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
796,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
797,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
798,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
799,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
800,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
801,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
802,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
803,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
804,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."

I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
827,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
828,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
829,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
830,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
831,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
832,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
833,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
834,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
835,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
836,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
837,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
838,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
839,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
840,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
841,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
842,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
843,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
844,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
845,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."

I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
868,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
869,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
870,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
871,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
872,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
873,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
874,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
875,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
876,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
877,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
878,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
879,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
880,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
881,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
882,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
883,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
884,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
885,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
886,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."

I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
910,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
911,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
912,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
913,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
914,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
915,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
916,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
917,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
918,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
919,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
920,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
921,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
922,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
923,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
924,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
925,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
926,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
927,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
928,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."

""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
951,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
952,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
953,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
954,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
955,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
956,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
957,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
958,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
959,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
960,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
961,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
962,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
963,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
964,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
965,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
966,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
967,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
968,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
969,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned.

Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
992,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
993,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
994,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
995,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
996,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
997,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
998,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
999,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
1000,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
1001,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
1002,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
1003,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
1004,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
1005,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
1006,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
1007,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
1008,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
1009,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
1010,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
1011,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick.

Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
1033,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
1034,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
1035,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
1036,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
1037,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
1038,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
1039,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
1040,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
1041,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
1042,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
1043,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
1044,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
1045,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
1046,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
1047,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
1048,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
1049,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
1050,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
1051,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"

The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
1074,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
1075,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
1076,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
1077,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
1078,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
1079,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
1080,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
1081,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
1082,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
1083,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
1084,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
1085,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
1086,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
1087,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
1088,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
1089,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
1090,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
1091,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
1092,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored.

Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
1115,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
1116,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
1117,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
1118,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
1119,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
1120,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
1121,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
1122,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
1123,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
1124,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
1125,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
1126,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
1127,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
1128,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
1129,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
1130,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
1131,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
1132,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
1133,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"

Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
1156,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
1157,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
1158,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
1159,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
1160,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
1161,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
1162,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
1163,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
1164,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
1165,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
1166,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
1167,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
1168,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
1169,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
1170,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
1171,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
1172,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
1173,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
1174,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."

1196,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet. The best part about Koja Kitchen is that despite eating a burger style sandwich, I did not feel bloated and heavy afterwards, which is a wonderful thing because of all of the walking that was required to fully experience Berkeley. Their prices were moderate and overall I would come back again in the future!"
1197,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
1198,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
1199,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
1200,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
1201,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
1202,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
1203,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
1204,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
1205,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
1206,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
1207,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
1208,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
1209,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
1210,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
1211,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
1212,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
1213,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
1214,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
1215,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot.

Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef.

1237,"You'll find trendy places in Berkeley that you won't see in SF. This place jumped out to us as we were looking for a place to eat near campus. Korean AND Japanese? Fusion? Sounds too good to be true. This place was very intriguing, and we didn't see anything better, so we walked in. Service was ok - nothing special, could be better. They seemed like young people going through the motions. The combos sounded very enticing, but they only included bowls. It would be great if they could include kojas in the combos.I ordered a koja because it sounded new and interesting. And I was pleasantly delighted. The veggie koja, with a big portobello mushroom, was VERY tasty and satisfying. Who'd have known? It looked tiny, but was surprisingly filling. The crisp rice ""bun"" was very nutty, crunchy, and delicious. The brownish, liquidy sauce was very tasty. Usually portobello veggie burgers are plain and disappointing, but it was a winner here. My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
1238,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
1239,"Wonderful and superRICH! The short rib Koja ""burger"" is the best. Tacos are great too!"
1240,Great concept of rice made into crispy buns.  The koja chicken didn't disappoint. The chicken bowl includes kimchi on top of a salad and chicken with rice.You order at the counter and pick up your order there.Am looking forward to Koja Kitchen opening  at more locations!
1241,"The ""koja"" is actually similar to what you would get if you cook rice for so long that water all evaporates and rice gets stuck on the pot, but I'm glad to see that they were able to reach a balance so that the inner chunk of the rice patties were still steam-rice soft, while the outer layer was crisp. I ordered the zen koja and the soy patty was good. However I was a bit misled by the menu and thought that there would be a large piece of portobello mushroom inside, while there's actually only bits and pieces of mushroom contained in the patty. The overall taste would've been awesome if not for the following 3 drawbacks: 1 terrible temperature control: my koja's patty and filling were both warm and good to eat, while the soy patty was too hot. As a result I had to wait for the patty to cool down.2 the koja was thick-- it's hard to bite and even harder to hold. Perhaps they can modify the design a bit?3 too much oil seeping from the filling and to the paper wrap... also, a bit salty.Bonus: call me biased, but the background sound they're playing was so weird."
1242,"If you're ever in the mood for a sit-down style food truck then this hip and fresh location is the spot to try. Having this bay area gem of korean-japanese infused food sitting in close proximity to my school was definitely something I knew I had to experience. I really appreciated how open the restaurant was in terms of space and it is one of the more cleaner of the restaurants in the Berkeley Area. The two times I went had not been packed so our food came out pretty quickly. So far that I've been here I've tried the beef koja, kamikaze fries, and ahi tuna bowl. I found each one to be both filling and delicious. They pack so much flavor into each one of their dishes and they don't try to ration their portions like most food truck style food places do. If you come with a friend, I'd definitely recommend sharing the kamakazi fries and trying either a bowl or koja. The Ahi Tuna bowl had similar tastes to poki-style bowls. The Koja is like a better version of the American Burger. There's so much flavor packed in the beef and the rice style bun was crispy and very tasty. If you haven't tried Koja Kitchen yet, please do yourself a flavor, AND YES I MEANT FLAVOR!!"
1243,"Yummy gourmet Korean-Japanese fusion sammiches! I love their garlic rice buns, especially since I feel like the ratio of bread to filling is always off in sandwiches.This location is near UC Berkeley's campus and parking isn't great, just street parking. If you're going Mon-Sat you'll have to pay the meter and it's pretty pricey, 25 cents only buys you 4 minutes. I got the chicken koja with fries and it was amazing! Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Portion sizes look small but it'll definitely fill you up. However, the koja doesn't hold up very well structurally, and half of the filling was overflowing/spilling out. As far as pricing, it's on the more expensive side for what you're getting but it's a definite treat :) Would recommend if you're looking for a savory bite."
1244,"I've stopped by here a couple of times since it's within walking distance from my apartment, and can confirm the consistent food quality I expect when walking into Koja. Last time I ordered the ahi tuna bowl, and I was surprised by the generous portion! Koja doesn't tend to give too large of a serving, so I wasn't expecting much, but the bowl was worth the price I paid! (A little less than $11?) the ahi tuna was so-so but in combination with the crispy fried toppings, salad, and rice created a winning combo."
1245,"I went up to Berkeley to catch up with a friend, and she recommended that I try this place. The thought of a Korean barbecue ""burger"" with rice as buns really intrigued me, so I had to make a stop. The sit-down restaurant was very clean and sleek. We came before the line started forming, so we were able to get a table. I got the short rib koja and kamikaze fries, while my friend had the chicken koja. We waited a couple of minutes, but it came out relatively fast. The short rib was cooked perfectly. It's my favorite cut, and they truly delivered a great product. It was well-marinated, juicy, and delicious. My friend enjoyed the chicken too. I do have to say that it was a little hard to eat because it was very stuffed. The kamikaze fries are wild. The actual fries are good on their own, but the sauces on top took it to a new level. Very satisfying. Service was on point, the workers had no problems taking time to clarify items on the menu.For the portions you receive, the price is fair, although a little high if you want to go for the short rib and fries. It's definitely a unique experience one will enjoy."
1246,"When I first heard of this place I wanted to try it right away but since I live in So Cal I knew it wouldn't be anytime soon.  I flew up to Nor Cal for a short trip and Koja was my first stop. I got there early so it wasn't busy yet.  I decided to get the beef Koja with kamikaze fries.  The beef Koja is KBBQ beef with sautéed onions, lettuce, sliced pineapple with spicy sauce all on two crispy chewy rice patties that act as the bun and sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The combination is fantastic.  Next time I'll add some kimchi to it.  I did add some siracha.  The kamikaze fries are waffle cut fries with bulgogi beef, minced kimchi, green onions and spicy sauce on top.  Both items were delish and worth going.  There is street parking in front and a parking structure diagonal to the place and offers the first hour free.  I really liked the koja and want to try the other flavors.  Hope they open a joint near me soon."
1247,"Koja was just very 'okay' for me. It might have been due to coming at a less popular time but nothing made me go 'wow!'. The restaurant itself is pretty clean with energetic cashiers.I ordered the braised pork koja and kamikaze fries but both came out not very warm-to the point where the buns started hardening up on me and making it less than enjoyable to consume. I was in a rush so didn't have time to wait for another order to come out so I ended up grabbing a fork to eat the filling with the kamikaze fries, leaving their famous 'buns' aside. The fries are not bad besides the lukewarmness. The flavors Koja creates are lovely and meld well so I'll come back probably at a better time to try the other kojas. It's a little messy eating everything but nothing a napkin can't save!"
1248,"This Korean place was a great satisfying stop. Definitely try the original short-rib koja. I really enjoyed the friend rice sandwich it comes in. It's crunchy and yummy. Tbe fries are also worth trying. I went with a group of 5 friends and everyone ordered different things and we liked all of it. It's located in Berkeley, California. It's small place with only indoor seating. They prepare the food pretty quickly. Worth checking out for sure."
1249,"Definitely not a hype! I came into this little shack expecting this place to be another over hyped business. Yet, too my surprise, it was great! I will definitely come back again if I was in the area! Service 5/5 The cashier was extremely welcoming and answered any questions we had. Although there was a long line, the food also came out at a reasonable pace. Excellent service! Food Short rib Koja- 5/5 our cashier recommended this. Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Highly recommend!  Teriyaki zen koja - 5/5 instead of meat, it is replaced with a well braised portobello mushroom. Vegan friend approved! Kamikaze fries- 5/5 criss cut fries with beef, kimchi, and japanese mayo. Oh my god. So yummy!!!!!"
1250,"My boyfriend had chicken bones in his chicken tacos at Koja! What the heck man... it's not even the fact that the tacos were less than $3 it shouldn't have been in his tacos in the first place. The food wasn't even cooked fresh and warm. It was cold tortilla and cold chicken. The fries were drenched in sauce and meat. It wasn't even warm. It looked like a lazy Wednesday to the workers. ""Why don't you complain to the manager.""""Why don't you get a refund.""If my bf and I are going to eat after a long day of work. We wouldn't have to go through that bs of cold food. Just sayin!"
1251,"Literally got here before the lunch rush. It's my first time having a rice patty burger ~ a lot harder then it looks, well not hard but crunchy goodness. With the burger, I didn't think my mouth could open big enough to get everything in one bite (ended up eating it apart with a fork...). Ordering and getting our food was painless and quick. Seating does fill up pretty quickly, but worse to worse, it's an easy to-go meal.Our order: Beef and chicken Koja: Rice patty was crunchy on the outside (reminds me of the bottom of clay pot rice dishes) and soft inside. Chicken was flavorful and moist (which always worry me when I get chicken because I really dislike dry chicken... like literally won't eat it). Beef was delicious, a little tough but nevertheless delicious. The sesame vinaigrette was perfect with the lettuce which needed a little acidity. There's the spicy gochujang sauce... which wasn't really spicy (could be just me though?) Umami fries: Super delicious and covered w/ toppings, very heavy though (filled me up a little too quickly). It is top heavy with sauce so I'd grab fries from the bottom to dip. Strawberry mango mint lemonade: Very refreshing but it needs more mint flavor, didn't really taste it at all. Final Thoughts: I'll definitely be back for more and to try the Mochimisu and the slush version of the strawberry mango mint lemonade!!"
1252,"Tasty but a little too heavy on the sauce, especially on the kamikaze fries. Cutting back on the sauce would make everything 10x better... hmm maybe I'll try asking for that next time I'm here! Highlights... my favorite part is the crispy rice ""bun."" MENU-Kamikaze fries: This is the ""thing"" to try when you're here. Super heavy on the sauce, which gets a little overpowering, but gotta love the waffle fries. -beef Koja burger: nom nom noms. Meat is well marinated and flavored. The pineapple adds a nice sweet tang to the overall taste and the rice bun balances out all of the flavors. Great snack if you're hungry for something filling and both salty and sweet."
1253,"Kitschy KoJas - fun fast food if you're in need of a quick snack.  KoJas make me think of spam musubi on steroids.  Addicting little buggers that might not be good for you, but oh-so-tasty.  I got the chicken KoJa ($6.25). The Korean BBQ chicken is wickedly good doused in the spicy gochujang sauce.  It was accompanied with a bit of tomato & lettuce, made crunchy with sesame seeds all in a rice cake sandwich and finished off with a squirt of a lemon wedge. The perfect deadly combo.  Enjoy!"
1254,"I loved going to KoJa Kitchen in The Richmond in the City, so when I moved to Berkeley, I was excited that there was a KoJa right on Telegraph! However, my first time trying to get food here, I first tried I use eat24 to order it, since Yelp conveniently directs me there. For some reason it didn't let me place the order, too close to closing time or something. Maybe this is eat24 just being a lessThan stellar app...because when I did come there were people picking up to go orders. Anyway, sitting on my couch, I tried to phone in an order. They don't take phone orders! What the hell is that?! It's like they're trying to be 21st-century about their ordering, but they're slipping into the 19th century. Please, allow people to place an order by phone! Sometimes we don't have access to the Internet or we're driving and it's just easier to put in a phone order."
1255,"First tried these guys at the off the grid trucks, always been one of my must go to trucks, so now that winter is here, it's good to know that I can still get my fix at a sit down spot. Ordered my usual, beef koja and kamikaze fries, but for reasons I can't quite point out, the hype at the sit down wasn't as good as the truck. Maybe there's just something about anticipating the food when you're waiting in line for awhile. As for the review on the food, there was definitely sauce overload on my kamikaze fries. I mean if I gotta take off some of the meat to eat just the fries, tells you it's too much. Oh and idk if they gave me the wrong order or they changed what they put on their beef koja, but there was a pineapple in mine. I didn't mind it though, it cut the salt of the sauce on the beef. Minus one star because the food at this location wasn't as good as I've had it. Still good, service is quick and friendly. My only real complaint was that the trash can was overflowing and it's right next to the napkins/utensils and soda machine."
1256,"Went to KoJa Kitchen with my cousins during my visit to Berkeley and I had no idea what they were going to put me through, but the beef Koja that my cousin ordered for me is unique and it was something that I had never experienced before in my life! The beef koja uses rice that is shaped into a bun instead of the conventional bread bun which allowed for a marvelous experience. In order for the rice to keep its shape, it is grilled. The grilling of the rice gives it a hard/dry texture. However, the dressing and marinate from the meat compensate for this and totally makes up for it to be delectable.  Their kamikaze fries were DELICIOUS and had a wide range flavors from spicy to sweet.

My companion ordered a chicken bowl, but it didn't look as beautiful or special as my koja. I had some of his fries, but it wasn't flavorful at all. Decor/ambiance was run-of-the-mill - what you'd expect for a trendy little eatery in a college town. I wish it were less open and all in the doorway. I wish more places were more cozy and comfortable. This was one of the better meals I've had in Berkeley. This place has potential. But they should make their food more consistent. Everything should be as delicious as the veggie koja!"
1278,The koja's were very delicious. We took our 1st generation Korean parents (70+years old) and they were pleasantly surprised after their first bite. We tried everything on the menu. The tacos were good but the kojas were better. Galbi and chicken meats were our favorite. Great new spin on Korean BBQ.
