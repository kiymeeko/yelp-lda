0,Clean place and fresh ingredients!For me small size is the perfect size for me. You get to choose two toppings (proteins) for small size and any other veggies!The workers were really nice too. I'd love to come back there again.
1,"I usually go to the Market to get this poke but I'm so glad to have discovered they have one in Berkeley now!Pros:Generous serving of fish (better than the Market in my experience) and super friendly staff. Seems like a good place with friends/a date/getting some work done (if not busy).Cons:Really just the parking for me, but this is basically for college students aka near campus so."
2,"I love to come here on my lunch break. The food tastes amazing all fresh ingredients and very nice staff. they gave you a lot of protein mix well with spring mix salad. I love to add more crispy onion and mixed nuts at the end.Only one unusual thing is while Is eating my poke at the restaurant, my eyes started running, I don't know why and I noticed that not only both of my friends had red eyes and others started to complain about the same things.I love the food here but if this happens again I won't think this will be a good sign for my one of favorite poke places. I still wanna know the reason that causes this. if anyone know please tell me thanks"
3,"Order: Medium all salmon with house and spicy mayoPros-they give you a generous serving of protein-I like how the crunchy toppings (fried onions, almonds, etc)  are self serve-reasonable price for the size of their servings-workers are really helpful and friendly-good amount of seating and very clean-great selection of fresh protein & toppings-I liked how they had a list of popular concoctions for the sauces , and they also had descriptions of how each sauce tastes Cons-have to pay extra for mango because a lot of poke places I've been to don't charge you for mango. -I didn't like how their crab tasted, it's not the usual crab salad that is mixed with a sauceOverall, I would definitely come back to Poke Bar because out of all the Poke places in Berkeley they give you  the most for your dollar!"
4,"FINALLY a solid poke place close to campus! Too bad I'll be leaving soon :(  Poke Bar is tucked away in Sather Lane (right next to Toust) and serves up some super fresh poke!! I would say the food itself is a solid 4 stars -- quality fish, generous portions, and a variety of mix-ins/toppings. Not the best poke I've ever had (can't beat poke in Hawaii!), but definitely the best poke in Berkeley! The price is, of course, a bit steeper than your average Asian Ghetto meal, but well worth it! What really makes this place ""as good as it gets"" is the staff -- the workers are all really friendly and the owner is super welcoming and has so much energy! He took the time to make sure our bowls were filled to the brim, checked up on us while we were eating, and excitedly invited us to come back again next time as we left haha :) Will definitely be coming back!!"
5,"TL;DR FRESH + AWESOME poke right next to Cal!This poke place is perfect. It is so close, literally right next to the campus (Sproul/MLK area). I got a small poke bowl, and I could've split it into 2 meals. I got the sunset bowl, and really enjoyed the pre-set topping combos. The sunset bowl came with salmon  + tuna, both really fresh. I liked the salmon a lot more because the tuna was a bit tough. You could probably switch out toppings from the pre-set menus, because the staff are super nice + accommodating. I opted for light sauce for a healthier poke bowl. They also have build your own bowls!Poke Bar it's so close to campus, I would definitely come here again. It's in Sather Lane, so go through the alley."
6,"I am so happy that they opened a Poke Bar in Berkeley! The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating and they definitely made it a good experience. The scoops of fish were big, and you definitely can just put in as much toppings as you want. I love that you can add in your own fried garlic and onions. For 11.50 for a medium, it was totally worth it because they stock it all the way up."
7,"I used to search for poke high and low; suddenly, there are THREE poke places on Telegraph - what?! Not complaining, but I wonder who will ""win"" - surely this can't last forever??Hashtag Poki has been my place up until now. While Poke Bar was great and still definitely deserves 4 stars, it didn't quite measure up. First, everything is about a buck more expensive, and they seem to charge for some of my staples that are free at most places - masago, most notably. Secondly, not all of the fish looked so great - the tuna was super pale and almost looked like it could still be frozen. Passed on that.  Finally, it was a bit of a challenge to snag a seat at lunchtime - if this is summer, I can't imagine how busy it will be when the students are all back in the fall! On an extremely picky note, the digital menu on the wall is also super super tiny - it was hard to get ready to order while waiting in line without popping out of line to stand closer to the counter and squint. But perhaps my bar has been set too high by Hashtag; indeed, Poke Bar had scallops (omg yes), which I haven't ever seen at a build-your-own poke place. The salmon was super fresh, and all of the protein scoops were generous. Finally, the guy at the register was the best - super friendly and made my husband and me laugh, which is a much-needed attitude this close to the stressful place that is UC Berkeley :). I'll be back when I'm too lazy to make it any further down Telegraph for sure!"
8,"Wonderful Wonderful Staff!! They're enthusiastic, kind, and helpful!We decided to try this place out after searching endlessly for a new Poke place. When we arrived, we had to park in the parking garage across the street (Free for the 1st hour). If you didn't know, it's pretty difficult to find any street parking in Berkeley. The restaurant is somewhat hidden, but it's located in this tiny food mall. The inside looks really clean and there are plenty of seats available!I ordered a medium ""Create My Own"" poke bowl with Salmon, Crab, Seaweed Salad, Pineapple, Cucumber, and Shoyu sauce (sesame oil and soy sauce mixed).  They give pretty big portions, almost enough for two meals! The fish is delicious and soft, but the pieces are cut a little bit too small for me. It was probably my fault, but I should've also asked for light sauce. Everything else in my bowl was enjoyable! Definitely a great place for college students who just want some Poke nearby!"
9,"So so happy a new poke place opened up closer to my apartment! I knew I had to give it a try as soon as I heard about it opening. Interior is clean and simple, with pops of their orange logo on the wall. The poke is ""chipotle style"" where the ingredients are displayed and you point and choose what you'd like to add to your Bowl. They have 3 sizes, and my boyfriend and I shared the large bowl, where you can choose up to 4 scoops of protein. Yum! There is a lot of ingredients to choose from, and being able to customize your Bowl is a plus. I forget how much we paid, but I do believe it's a bit pricey, but tasty nonetheless! Would recommend and will come back for more!"
10,"Big portions of what is arguably quality fish. Super friendly service with an abundance of smiles all around. A giant veggie selection to go with your fish. And some nice additions additional toppings that your average Poke place won't offer. In short: worth a visit, worth a return!"
11,"There have been a lot more Poke places popping up around Berkeley/ Oakland area as of late. Poke Bar has friendly service, is clean, and spacious. Their sauces are tasty but the fish quality is just OK. [The location] It's a bit hidden, but this location is spacious. I came here with my friends and it was pretty empty. Maybe because everyone is going on summer vacation since the semester just ended. It is a decent sized space that's very clean and has a lot of seating. [The food] Very simple to order. Choose your size, rice/salad, protein, and toppings. I got the large with white rice with furikake, comes with a scoop of imitation crab and seaweed salad, protein (large comes with 4 scoops-tuna, albacore, scallop, and salmon), and toppings (edamame, cucumber, pineapple, and a few others)For my sauce, I combined the house sauce with ponzu. The sauce was flavorful. Price: 13.50 The fish quality in my opinion, was just so-so. The tuna was my least favorite because it seemed like it was still half frozen. The albacore had a nice smoky flavor, the salmon was average, and the scallops weren't bad! I really liked the seaweed salad and the crab was a nice touch of flavor. Overall, if I was still a student at Cal, I would probably stop by here for lunch because there is so much variety included with the fish which is nice.This is the first poke place that I've been to that offered pineapple and mango as a topping."
12,"I was pretty excited to see that a poke bar was coming to Berkeley, so I had to check it out as soon as it opened!The whole place felt really clean, from the actual cleanliness to the simple lines of the decor. The space is open with ample seating, which is nice most places in Berkeley are too small to support big groups.When I went, it seemed like they were still trying to get their process in order, which is understandable since they just opened yesterday. I got a custom poke bowl to go and it took them a little while to find a lid for my box, but the staff were really nice the whole time.The system is set up generally the same as most poke places- pick a size (based on number of protein scoops), pick a base (white rice, brown rice, mixed greens, nachos), pick proteins (types of fish or tofu for vegetarians), pick veggies, pick toppings, pick sauce. Avocado or mango can be added for +$1. I recommend the spicy mix sauce! The portions are a bit smaller compared to other poke places, even though the prices are about the same. It was a good portion size for me though, since I usually can't finish a whole poke bowl and it's not really the kind of food that keeps well as leftovers.Anyways, I think this place will do really well in Berkeley and I look forward to coming back soon!"
13,"I wasn't the biggest fan of Simply Bowl's poke offerings, so I was really pleasantly surprised to have stumbled upon Poké Bar! Unlike Simply Bowl, Poké Bar offers CYO customization which I'm all about. Overall, everything about Poké Bar is pretty standard when compared to its competitors around the Bay Area - CYO or pre-set menu style options, and an overall modern/hip aesthetic. Regardless, I'm thrilled to see it nestled right next to Cal. Delicious, fast, and healthy lunches. Yes please!"
14,"The service is super great, I just want to say that first-off. They are super friendly and give you more of something if you don't want something else. When I left the server said see you next time! Literally the first time I've heard that in a restaurant in Berkeley in my three years here. The three stars is mostly because the crab they serve isn't the usual crab mixture that I like :( The fish is super fresh and I like that you can mix and match. I don't like seaweed or cucumber in my poke so they gave me extra crab. Which would have been great if I wasn't a fan of the crab mixture. The rice was fresh and had a good flavor and they definitely packed everything so it's a pretty good deal. Would I go back? Maybe if a friend really wanted to go and if they changed the crab mixture."
15,"Quick, healthy and delicious! The base of the bowl is brown or white rice. They have delicious toppings here and all, including the fish, taste very fresh. There is a variety of sauces, so you cannot get bored. It's all served in a compostable container. My favorite is double salmon with mango, avocado, lots of veggies and a mix of the spicy sauces. What's not to love?"
16,"Great place, wonderful staff and amazing food!  So many choices and combinations, this spot really spoils you. The raw ingredients were prepped well and kept fresh. If you're a person who doesn't each much the small portion might last you two meals.The place was little hard to find, but don't let that keep you from checking it out!"
17,"What a great poke place!  The staff is the best part; they are enthusiastic, friendly, patient, and helpful.  But the food is fresh (no compromise allowed for poke!), there are lots of options, and they have macaron ice cream sandwiches as well.The a-ghetto can be tough if you're not going for the lowest possible price point, and open very late. But I REALLY hope they do a strong business here, and I intend to help them out with that as much as possible!"
18,"I love this place! It's my go to summer lunch spot when I'm trying to eat a bit healthier and lighter. It's located conveniently close to campus. You can build your own bowl or choose one of their combos. The fish quality is good for what you're paying and they have a good selection of standard toppings and mix-ins. Crab salad and seaweed salad (wakame) are included in the price but mango and avocado are extra. The avocado is actually a great deal because they don't skimp on it--they give you half an avocado for $1 extraThe space is bright and efficient with a good amount of seating. Usually the service speed is alright but you can expect a line at peak meal hours. The staff are also really friendly -- the owner (maybe manager?) makes the effort to thank every customer for his/her patronage when they pay and leave. It's not the MOST affordable meal option, but if you share a large with a friend it comes out much more economically."
19,"Poké Bar recently opened up in Sather Gate, so I definitely wanted to check it out. There are set Poké Bowls on the menu, but I opted to go for the ""create your own bowl."" It's super easy to order :) I got the Medium bowl (3 toppings) with salmon, scallop, and shrimp, brown rice, all veggies, and ponzu and sweet chili sauce. The fish is fresh and tasty, and the amount they give you is quite reasonable! I usually go for brown rice since it's more on the healthier side, but you can opt for white rice or salad as well! Oh snap, the interior is a e s t h e t i c!! The vibrant orange logo that covers the wall and that goes on the lid of your poké bowl really adds a nice touch to your experience there!! I wouldn't mind having a photoshoot here tbhI ended up paying $11.30 for the bowl, which is a bit pricy for a poké bowl compared to other places in Berkeley. However, its super close to campus, so if you're in a rush and craving poké, this is the place!!"

While Poke Bar was great and still definitely deserves 4 stars, it didn't quite measure up. First, everything is about a buck more expensive, and they seem to charge for some of my staples that are free at most places - masago, most notably. Secondly, not all of the fish looked so great - the tuna was super pale and almost looked like it could still be frozen. Passed on that.  Finally, it was a bit of a challenge to snag a seat at lunchtime - if this is summer, I can't imagine how busy it will be when the students are all back in the fall! On an extremely picky note, the digital menu on the wall is also super super tiny - it was hard to get ready to order while waiting in line without popping out of line to stand closer to the counter and squint. But perhaps my bar has been set too high by Hashtag; indeed, Poke Bar had scallops (omg yes), which I haven't ever seen at a build-your-own poke place. The salmon was super fresh, and all of the protein scoops were generous. Finally, the guy at the register was the best - super friendly and made my husband and me laugh, which is a much-needed attitude this close to the stressful place that is UC Berkeley :). I'll be back when I'm too lazy to make it any further down Telegraph for sure!"
48,"Wonderful Wonderful Staff!! They're enthusiastic, kind, and helpful!We decided to try this place out after searching endlessly for a new Poke place. When we arrived, we had to park in the parking garage across the street (Free for the 1st hour). If you didn't know, it's pretty difficult to find any street parking in Berkeley. The restaurant is somewhat hidden, but it's located in this tiny food mall. The inside looks really clean and there are plenty of seats available!I ordered a medium ""Create My Own"" poke bowl with Salmon, Crab, Seaweed Salad, Pineapple, Cucumber, and Shoyu sauce (sesame oil and soy sauce mixed).  They give pretty big portions, almost enough for two meals! The fish is delicious and soft, but the pieces are cut a little bit too small for me. It was probably my fault, but I should've also asked for light sauce. Everything else in my bowl was enjoyable! Definitely a great place for college students who just want some Poke nearby!"
49,"So so happy a new poke place opened up closer to my apartment! I knew I had to give it a try as soon as I heard about it opening. Interior is clean and simple, with pops of their orange logo on the wall. The poke is ""chipotle style"" where the ingredients are displayed and you point and choose what you'd like to add to your Bowl. They have 3 sizes, and my boyfriend and I shared the large bowl, where you can choose up to 4 scoops of protein. Yum! There is a lot of ingredients to choose from, and being able to customize your Bowl is a plus. I forget how much we paid, but I do believe it's a bit pricey, but tasty nonetheless! Would recommend and will come back for more!"
50,"Big portions of what is arguably quality fish. Super friendly service with an abundance of smiles all around. A giant veggie selection to go with your fish. And some nice additions additional toppings that your average Poke place won't offer. In short: worth a visit, worth a return!"
51,"There have been a lot more Poke places popping up around Berkeley/ Oakland area as of late. Poke Bar has friendly service, is clean, and spacious. Their sauces are tasty but the fish quality is just OK. [The location] It's a bit hidden, but this location is spacious. I came here with my friends and it was pretty empty. Maybe because everyone is going on summer vacation since the semester just ended. It is a decent sized space that's very clean and has a lot of seating. [The food] Very simple to order. Choose your size, rice/salad, protein, and toppings. I got the large with white rice with furikake, comes with a scoop of imitation crab and seaweed salad, protein (large comes with 4 scoops-tuna, albacore, scallop, and salmon), and toppings (edamame, cucumber, pineapple, and a few others)For my sauce, I combined the house sauce with ponzu. The sauce was flavorful. Price: 13.50 The fish quality in my opinion, was just so-so. The tuna was my least favorite because it seemed like it was still half frozen. The albacore had a nice smoky flavor, the salmon was average, and the scallops weren't bad! I really liked the seaweed salad and the crab was a nice touch of flavor. Overall, if I was still a student at Cal, I would probably stop by here for lunch because there is so much variety included with the fish which is nice.This is the first poke place that I've been to that offered pineapple and mango as a topping."
52,"I was pretty excited to see that a poke bar was coming to Berkeley, so I had to check it out as soon as it opened!The whole place felt really clean, from the actual cleanliness to the simple lines of the decor. The space is open with ample seating, which is nice most places in Berkeley are too small to support big groups.When I went, it seemed like they were still trying to get their process in order, which is understandable since they just opened yesterday. I got a custom poke bowl to go and it took them a little while to find a lid for my box, but the staff were really nice the whole time.The system is set up generally the same as most poke places- pick a size (based on number of protein scoops), pick a base (white rice, brown rice, mixed greens, nachos), pick proteins (types of fish or tofu for vegetarians), pick veggies, pick toppings, pick sauce. Avocado or mango can be added for +$1. I recommend the spicy mix sauce! The portions are a bit smaller compared to other poke places, even though the prices are about the same. It was a good portion size for me though, since I usually can't finish a whole poke bowl and it's not really the kind of food that keeps well as leftovers.Anyways, I think this place will do really well in Berkeley and I look forward to coming back soon!"
53,"I wasn't the biggest fan of Simply Bowl's poke offerings, so I was really pleasantly surprised to have stumbled upon Poké Bar! Unlike Simply Bowl, Poké Bar offers CYO customization which I'm all about. Overall, everything about Poké Bar is pretty standard when compared to its competitors around the Bay Area - CYO or pre-set menu style options, and an overall modern/hip aesthetic. Regardless, I'm thrilled to see it nestled right next to Cal. Delicious, fast, and healthy lunches. Yes please!"
54,"The service is super great, I just want to say that first-off. They are super friendly and give you more of something if you don't want something else. When I left the server said see you next time! Literally the first time I've heard that in a restaurant in Berkeley in my three years here. The three stars is mostly because the crab they serve isn't the usual crab mixture that I like :( The fish is super fresh and I like that you can mix and match. I don't like seaweed or cucumber in my poke so they gave me extra crab. Which would have been great if I wasn't a fan of the crab mixture. The rice was fresh and had a good flavor and they definitely packed everything so it's a pretty good deal. Would I go back? Maybe if a friend really wanted to go and if they changed the crab mixture."
55,"Quick, healthy and delicious! The base of the bowl is brown or white rice. They have delicious toppings here and all, including the fish, taste very fresh. There is a variety of sauces, so you cannot get bored. It's all served in a compostable container. My favorite is double salmon with mango, avocado, lots of veggies and a mix of the spicy sauces. What's not to love?"
56,"Great place, wonderful staff and amazing food!  So many choices and combinations, this spot really spoils you. The raw ingredients were prepped well and kept fresh. If you're a person who doesn't each much the small portion might last you two meals.The place was little hard to find, but don't let that keep you from checking it out!"
57,"What a great poke place!  The staff is the best part; they are enthusiastic, friendly, patient, and helpful.  But the food is fresh (no compromise allowed for poke!), there are lots of options, and they have macaron ice cream sandwiches as well.The a-ghetto can be tough if you're not going for the lowest possible price point, and open very late. But I REALLY hope they do a strong business here, and I intend to help them out with that as much as possible!"
58,"I love this place! It's my go to summer lunch spot when I'm trying to eat a bit healthier and lighter. It's located conveniently close to campus. You can build your own bowl or choose one of their combos. The fish quality is good for what you're paying and they have a good selection of standard toppings and mix-ins. Crab salad and seaweed salad (wakame) are included in the price but mango and avocado are extra. The avocado is actually a great deal because they don't skimp on it--they give you half an avocado for $1 extraThe space is bright and efficient with a good amount of seating. Usually the service speed is alright but you can expect a line at peak meal hours. The staff are also really friendly -- the owner (maybe manager?) makes the effort to thank every customer for his/her patronage when they pay and leave. It's not the MOST affordable meal option, but if you share a large with a friend it comes out much more economically."
59,"Poké Bar recently opened up in Sather Gate, so I definitely wanted to check it out. There are set Poké Bowls on the menu, but I opted to go for the ""create your own bowl."" It's super easy to order :) I got the Medium bowl (3 toppings) with salmon, scallop, and shrimp, brown rice, all veggies, and ponzu and sweet chili sauce. The fish is fresh and tasty, and the amount they give you is quite reasonable! I usually go for brown rice since it's more on the healthier side, but you can opt for white rice or salad as well! Oh snap, the interior is a e s t h e t i c!! The vibrant orange logo that covers the wall and that goes on the lid of your poké bowl really adds a nice touch to your experience there!! I wouldn't mind having a photoshoot here tbhI ended up paying $11.30 for the bowl, which is a bit pricy for a poké bowl compared to other places in Berkeley. However, its super close to campus, so if you're in a rush and craving poké, this is the place!!"
