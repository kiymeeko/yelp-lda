I was so excited coming in here because I saw the different variations you can do, as well as the other yummy appetizers they had on the menu! I got the spinach noodles with half malay(peanut) and half thai(spicy) with chicken as my protein. I like that the stir fry option already comes with lots of vegetables and egg. The two sauces combined gave it a nice creamy texture. The thai spicy sauce wasnt spicy at all! The noodles were cooked perfectlyThe bf got the thin rice tom yum soup with chicken. I didnt get to try a lot of it, but the soup was tom yum soup was yummmyyWe also got the TOSS beef salad. I was kinda dejected because I saw a picture of it on the yelp page and it looked really good, like a steak salad. But when it came out, it was more like a vietnamese lemongrass beef salad instead. I really wanted to try their croquette and samosas but when I got there, they didn't have it on their menu! I was kinda disappointed.Anyways it was self serve after they bring you your food. They had cute mason jars for you to fill up at the water station and a bucket to put your dirty bowls. I only noticed this after but if you look at the TOSS symbol, you can notice that the T and O make a wok and the S S are noodles! This is a cheap and easy meal. Parking sucks because it's so crowded and in downtown"
1,"A decent place to grab a quick dinner downtown, and cheaper than most places downtown.It's a build you own noodle/rice bowl, where you select you noodle/rice type, protein, and sauce. I really like the hokkien and spinach noodles (they maintain a good chew), usually with chicken and the Chinese or Japanese sauce. The portions are ok, you don't get a lot of the protein for what you pay, but it's tasty and again, it's much cheaper than most other places downtown. I've also tried their curry, which is alright- I'd still probably go somewhere that's just Thai food like Racha or Thai noodle for curry, but the curry here isn't bad. The restaurant itself is pretty cute, with a good range of tables for small to large groups (you order then seat yourself). One weird thing about it is that there's always flies hovering around the door? Nothing major and they're not inside the restaurant but it isn't the most pleasant experience walking into the restaurant."
2,"This place is an upscale fast food restaurant basically. The service is quick but the food is just alright. Definitely can be a quick fix for comfort food for those Asian college students who miss their parents cooking. You basically have control of what you put in your bowl. There are three options: rice, noodles, or fried rice. From there, you then choose your sauces, veggies, and/or meat. I got the soup with glass noodle, Tom Yum base, and beef. Tasted okay. The soup wasn't as strong like other Thai places and I would have also been okay with not finishing my meal. After you order, it's mostly self service. There's water on the side of the restaurant with cute Mason jars. However this establishment is quite small so I would not recommend large parties."
3,"Noodles for everyone! Toss is a great place to go when you can't decide what type of asian flavor, you particularly want. It's great for a group of people who just can't decide on one type of asian food. Hidden next to UA Berkeley Theaters, Toss is a casual asian fusion restaurant where you are able to combine different noodles, sauces, and meats. I've been to this place throughout my years at Berkeley and it never fails to satisfy my hunger for asian noodles. I usually get the hokkien noodles, which is a thick yellow egg noodles that absorbs the sauce you choose. I've tried most of the sauces but the best one would have to be the Malay peanut sauce. It adds a hearty peanut flavor to the noodles that I haven't seen anywhere else. If you aren't in the mood for any of the sauces the Laska, which is a curry coconut soup is perfect for a cold day. Make sure to ask for spicy or add your own spices, since it usually comes out bland without it. There is also rice dishes, but they never seem to be worth getting. The only complaint I have is that the sauces lack a depth of flavors like restaurants that focus on only one or two noodle dishes. However, for only $10 dollars, Toss has good portions sizes that is good for lunch and dinner!"
4,"Affordable, good place by campus for food. Choose your own noodles, sauce, veggies, meat, etc and they'll make it for you. Portion sizes are good, but nothing's amazing since you have the risk of putting not so great things together. Protip: get what you think you'll like."
5,This is your quick fast casual for noodles. You get to choose the type of noodles sauce and protein I got the hokkien noodles with Thai and Malay with chicken. It came out super quickly and each dish comes in a big bowl. It also comes with a bunch of different vegetables in the dish. It tasted slightly sweet but a little spicy but not too much. I wanted to get extra chili to spice it up! The noodles were stir fry quickly and I can see the wok hey markings on the noodles. It's around $10/$11 for each so it's a quick bite to eat. Just walk in and go directly to the counter. The waiter will give you a number and bring the food to you. Parking is rough in the area. I usually park near YMCA or the park a couple blocks away and walk here. Grab some noodles and walk it off in downtown Berkeley!
6,"Toss Noddle Bar is probably my favorite noodle place in all of Berkeley, and I don't know why I didn't go here since freshman year. TO be honest, I don't even remember what I ordered since I came a while back ago, but all I can tell you is that there isn't anything that can go wrong.Think of it as a subway, for noodles. haha, it's so customizable, and they even let you combine spaces which was pretty neat! This place isn't really great for large groups, which can be a downfall, but groups of 4 are perfect."
7,"I found this little gem while browsing in the search section on Yelp and have been coming back ever since.It is soooooo freaking good OMG. It's a design your own but they do have pre-set items that go in it. For instance, it comes with noodles but you get to pick which style you want. I always get hokkien noodles. They are thick like chow mein for those that are unfamiliar with the names. It comes with meat but you get to choose which one or two you want. Typically I get chicken but I have tried the combo and got chicken and prawn. The prawn wasn't cooked all the way : ( you pick your sauce of choice, I always get the Thai sauce. It's spicey. All noodle options come with veggies.For less than $10 and very filling. Yes! You can't beat that. I gave 4 stars just for the half cooked prawn. It happened both times I ordered the combo so I cannot even say it was an accident the first time. If I had known the shrimp would still be see through i wouldn't have ordered the combo. I ordered it a second time thinking maybe the first time it was an accident, so I tried again. Whomp, same issue. Some people may like it like that, but nah, if I wanted a shrimp cocktail I went somewhere that had that on the menu."
8,"The prices are reasonable and the food is tasty but the place is a little dirty and there are usually some flies around the restaurant. Water is self serve and you're supposed to bring your dishes to the their dish tray when you're done.I ordered the hokkaido noodles with Thai sauce and beef and the portions were fairly large. Overall, it is a pretty good place for a quick and tasty bite that won't break the bank."
9,"Alongside the busy strip of Shattuck Avenue lies a somewhat hidden Toss Noodle Bar where one can customize their noodles to their liking.I've tried this place a couple times now and I find the concept to be quite interesting. All in all, it's similar to Pieology and Chipotle, but for noodles. Choose your meats, sauce, type of noodles, and etc. based on your own preferences and they'll make it for you. I've tried various combinations and for the price, I did enjoy what I got though I found that no matter what I chose the enjoyment per bite depreciated very quickly. I feel that Toss is special in it's wide variety of possible combinations, but in that variety, there is a lack of specialization and passion for the food it serves due to it's concept of personal customization. Overall, I would say it's a fun experience to try, but for a good noodle dish, I would prefer a location where the chef understands the flavors and combinations that work to make a fulfilling mix of flavors with personality."
10,"Our family got caught in the pouring rain but thank goodness for Toss Noodle Bar!This eatery serves up noodle dishes, soups and rice bowls in a casual setting. Order up at the counter, pay and grab your own utensils and water. You clean up after yourself too! Why am I a fan of these places? because they keep the costs low. Most dishes are $10 or less!Whether easy or picky eaters, everyone has the freedom to choose whatever combo they want. You choose your base (noodle or rice), add your sauce (laksa, peanut sauce, hoisin, etc) add your meat. Then you can say if you just want it plain stir fry or in a soup. You can get your pho fix here too!I wasn't absurdly hungry so I ordered a bunch of appetizers for myself and for the table: chicken satay ($6), fried croquettes ($5), tofu salad ($4) coconut shrimp ($6).  Everything was cooked just right and had delicious accompanying sauces. Yum.Thanks Toss for keeping our family lunch affordable and fun! There was definitely a choice for everyone."
11,"When I first walked through the doors of Toss, there was a strange odor, almost like wet dog smell. I knew I wasn't alone, because the person I was with, who also happened to be the one who suggested Toss to me, also smelled it. The smell did not last long, it's just not what I was expecting from a restaurant. The menu is very simple. You pick what type of noodles you want (rice also available), then you choose the sauce you want it tossed in, and finally you choose your meat option. I went with wheat noodles, Thai sauce, and chicken. The food came out very quick. The wheat noodles are skinny noodles, which I prefer because it's easier to eat, in my opinion. I love the fresh veggies they use, and the Thai sauce was awesome. We also shared a plate of garlic edamame. The garlic were nice sized pieces, and fresh. The edamame is tossed in soy sauce, which adds another welcome flavor element. The restaurant has a nice, chill vibe to it. They havr a water station, where you can pour your own water, and the water itself is spa water (cucumber slices in it). In the end, they serve great food at a great price."
12,"We were looking for soup on a Thursday night. We couldn't believe how difficult it was to find soup or even a restaurant that's open past 8:30 pm.  This place was perfect. We created a bowl of soup - hokkien noodles, clear soup, and chicken. The waitress brought it to our table; nice and hot with good flavor.  Everything we saw being delivered to customers looked good. There's so many choices in designing your own meal. Stop in and try one; you won't be disappointed."
13,"I really do enjoy the noodles at this restaurant but I'm giving this review only 2 stars because the portion sizes at Toss is very disappointing. I started coming here a couple of years ago and every single time I come, the amount of noodles that actually go into my bowl heavily decreases. Noodles are pretty cheap, I could literally buy 3 noodle plates in Chinatown for less than $15. BUT I'm paying around $10-$13 at Toss for a bowl of noodles that barely reach the middle of my bowl. The last and final time I came here, I ordered the hokkien noodles with Thai sauce and beef, when the lady brought out my noodles, I could literally see the bottom of the bowl... THATS HOW LITTLE NOODLES I GOT! Are you serious Toss? I'm not blind. I had to go up to the cashier and let her know how disappointed I was before a new bowl was brought out to me. Overall, the noodles here are good, but since it seems like a ten dollar bill gets me less than half a bowl of noodles, I'll go spend my money at Imm Thai instead."
14,"I've come here a few times and now and ordered something different each time and have yet to be disappointed! You choose your base first: noodle, rice, or fried rice. There are 5 types of noodles and the option for white or brown rice. Then you pick the flavour you want. There are 5 different stir fry flavours as well as the option to get curry! Finally you pick a protein - tofu is the only vegetarian option and there's also plenty of meat options.I've had curry, fried rice, and noodles and they've all been great! Portion size is good and all the dishes come with plenty of veggies and egg as well. The tofu has also always been well cooked unlike some places where I've experienced semi raw chunks of tofu thrown in. Overall, I love the variety and consistency of their food and I can't wait to try more combos in the future!"
15,"Won't stop until I've tried every single noodle/rice/sauce/meat combination!Toss is seriously SOOOOO bae!  It's a fun process or ordering because you get to pick your own noodles or rice, sauce and meat.  You make exactly what you want to eat and it's all very good quality!There's not much of a customer service aspect here because you order at the counter and then just wait for your food to be brought to you at the table.  I like that there are big pitchers of water for customers though so we can keep one at the table.  I can't stand not having enough beverage with my meal!Toss has the traditional thai restaurant sauces with the chili, jalepenos, etc. but they have one that's a smooth consistency and spicy and it is HEAVEN!!!  If you like spice, DEFINITELY use this to spice up your dishPros: you get to order exactly what you want every time.  There are so many combinations of orders to get here and they're all equally good.cons: people who haven't been tend to order as if they've never heard of food before and might take a while if they're not used to the ordering process here, so beware.  TIP! if you order curry with noodles, I like to ask them to put them together so I don't have to mix in the noodles with the sauce myself.  It lets the noodles absorb more curry sauce.  It's SO good!Toss is definitely a fun place to come with friends for a fun dinner with delicious food and great atmosphere!  The staff is friendly and they make DELICIOUS food that will always leave you wanting to come back again!"
16,"Thai-Hokkien-beef YASS! My go-to noodle bar whenever I'm back in NorCal! You honestly can't go wrong with any combo here. Everything is delicious --even the Tom yum is up to par with my standards. Coconut prawns were also pretty tasty, but nothing to get super hyped about"
17,"Filling noodle dishes for good prices. Toss Noodle Bar made the order process simple: choose one of four different noodles, your meat/tofu, and your sauce. I personally liked the Hokkein noodles with shrimp and peanut sauce. Was quite delicious! Although the restaurant was packed the food came out quick. You gotta clean up after yourself but I'm happily doing so as the noodles were great and the prices aiiiiiright!"
18,"I've come several times in the past and ended up staring at a bunch of flies zooming around the restaurant entrance.  Pretty unappetizing for me...For some reason, a lot of my friends want to come here for dinner so I've been way more times than I would've chosen to.   You can choose your noodles/rice, protein, and sauce (or make it a soup).  The meal comes out to around $10, which is pretty decent.  My favorite combo has to be the the Hokkien noodle with chicken and peanut sauce.  Don't get me wrong.  The food is good.  I just don't really get the hype.  There's generally always a place for you to sit after ordering at the register.  There's cute mason jars for your water needs."
19,"I  usually am a man with the determination to finish any meal I get at restaurants, but when it comes to Toss Noodle Bar's bowls, they are so generous that I can't finish them; however, it's great because that means I can get some of that deliciousness for leftovers. Truly large portions with delicious soups like their sour and spicy tomyum.Honestly, do not come here for anything but the noodles. The curry or stir fry portions are not so filling and they cost as much as the soups because they charge based on the meat, so go for the bowls!Biggest plus is that they do not kick you out for bringing in outside drinks for example. Come here a lot with friends out of random bursts of cravings and I've come in with coffee or boba and they do not have a problem with that, which is great!"

Come here a lot with friends out of random bursts of cravings and I've come in with coffee or boba and they do not have a problem with that, which is great!"
40,"I love them nooDZ NOODZ nOODZ, noodz i do adooreeseriously this place is amazeballs. I love that you can customize your entire order. I was so excited coming in here because I saw the different variations you can do, as well as the other yummy appetizers they had on the menu! I got the spinach noodles with half malay(peanut) and half thai(spicy) with chicken as my protein. I like that the stir fry option already comes with lots of vegetables and egg. The two sauces combined gave it a nice creamy texture. The thai spicy sauce wasnt spicy at all! The noodles were cooked perfectlyThe bf got the thin rice tom yum soup with chicken. I didnt get to try a lot of it, but the soup was tom yum soup was yummmyyWe also got the TOSS beef salad. I was kinda dejected because I saw a picture of it on the yelp page and it looked really good, like a steak salad. But when it came out, it was more like a vietnamese lemongrass beef salad instead. I really wanted to try their croquette and samosas but when I got there, they didn't have it on their menu! I was kinda disappointed.Anyways it was self serve after they bring you your food. They had cute mason jars for you to fill up at the water station and a bucket to put your dirty bowls. I only noticed this after but if you look at the TOSS symbol, you can notice that the T and O make a wok and the S S are noodles! This is a cheap and easy meal. Parking sucks because it's so crowded and in downtown"
41,"A decent place to grab a quick dinner downtown, and cheaper than most places downtown.It's a build you own noodle/rice bowl, where you select you noodle/rice type, protein, and sauce. I really like the hokkien and spinach noodles (they maintain a good chew), usually with chicken and the Chinese or Japanese sauce. The portions are ok, you don't get a lot of the protein for what you pay, but it's tasty and again, it's much cheaper than most other places downtown. I've also tried their curry, which is alright- I'd still probably go somewhere that's just Thai food like Racha or Thai noodle for curry, but the curry here isn't bad. The restaurant itself is pretty cute, with a good range of tables for small to large groups (you order then seat yourself). One weird thing about it is that there's always flies hovering around the door? Nothing major and they're not inside the restaurant but it isn't the most pleasant experience walking into the restaurant."
42,"This place is an upscale fast food restaurant basically. The service is quick but the food is just alright. Definitely can be a quick fix for comfort food for those Asian college students who miss their parents cooking. You basically have control of what you put in your bowl. There are three options: rice, noodles, or fried rice. From there, you then choose your sauces, veggies, and/or meat. I got the soup with glass noodle, Tom Yum base, and beef. Tasted okay. The soup wasn't as strong like other Thai places and I would have also been okay with not finishing my meal. After you order, it's mostly self service. There's water on the side of the restaurant with cute Mason jars. However this establishment is quite small so I would not recommend large parties."
43,"Noodles for everyone! Toss is a great place to go when you can't decide what type of asian flavor, you particularly want. It's great for a group of people who just can't decide on one type of asian food. Hidden next to UA Berkeley Theaters, Toss is a casual asian fusion restaurant where you are able to combine different noodles, sauces, and meats. I've been to this place throughout my years at Berkeley and it never fails to satisfy my hunger for asian noodles. I usually get the hokkien noodles, which is a thick yellow egg noodles that absorbs the sauce you choose. I've tried most of the sauces but the best one would have to be the Malay peanut sauce. It adds a hearty peanut flavor to the noodles that I haven't seen anywhere else. If you aren't in the mood for any of the sauces the Laska, which is a curry coconut soup is perfect for a cold day. Make sure to ask for spicy or add your own spices, since it usually comes out bland without it. There is also rice dishes, but they never seem to be worth getting. The only complaint I have is that the sauces lack a depth of flavors like restaurants that focus on only one or two noodle dishes. However, for only $10 dollars, Toss has good portions sizes that is good for lunch and dinner!"
44,"Affordable, good place by campus for food. Choose your own noodles, sauce, veggies, meat, etc and they'll make it for you. Portion sizes are good, but nothing's amazing since you have the risk of putting not so great things together. Protip: get what you think you'll like."
45,This is your quick fast casual for noodles. You get to choose the type of noodles sauce and protein I got the hokkien noodles with Thai and Malay with chicken. It came out super quickly and each dish comes in a big bowl. It also comes with a bunch of different vegetables in the dish. It tasted slightly sweet but a little spicy but not too much. I wanted to get extra chili to spice it up! The noodles were stir fry quickly and I can see the wok hey markings on the noodles. It's around $10/$11 for each so it's a quick bite to eat. Just walk in and go directly to the counter. The waiter will give you a number and bring the food to you. Parking is rough in the area. I usually park near YMCA or the park a couple blocks away and walk here. Grab some noodles and walk it off in downtown Berkeley!
46,"Toss Noddle Bar is probably my favorite noodle place in all of Berkeley, and I don't know why I didn't go here since freshman year. TO be honest, I don't even remember what I ordered since I came a while back ago, but all I can tell you is that there isn't anything that can go wrong.Think of it as a subway, for noodles. haha, it's so customizable, and they even let you combine spaces which was pretty neat! This place isn't really great for large groups, which can be a downfall, but groups of 4 are perfect."
47,"I found this little gem while browsing in the search section on Yelp and have been coming back ever since.It is soooooo freaking good OMG. It's a design your own but they do have pre-set items that go in it. For instance, it comes with noodles but you get to pick which style you want. I always get hokkien noodles. They are thick like chow mein for those that are unfamiliar with the names. It comes with meat but you get to choose which one or two you want. Typically I get chicken but I have tried the combo and got chicken and prawn. The prawn wasn't cooked all the way : ( you pick your sauce of choice, I always get the Thai sauce. It's spicey. All noodle options come with veggies.For less than $10 and very filling. Yes! You can't beat that. I gave 4 stars just for the half cooked prawn. It happened both times I ordered the combo so I cannot even say it was an accident the first time. If I had known the shrimp would still be see through i wouldn't have ordered the combo. I ordered it a second time thinking maybe the first time it was an accident, so I tried again. Whomp, same issue. Some people may like it like that, but nah, if I wanted a shrimp cocktail I went somewhere that had that on the menu."
48,"The prices are reasonable and the food is tasty but the place is a little dirty and there are usually some flies around the restaurant. Water is self serve and you're supposed to bring your dishes to the their dish tray when you're done.I ordered the hokkaido noodles with Thai sauce and beef and the portions were fairly large. Overall, it is a pretty good place for a quick and tasty bite that won't break the bank."
49,"Alongside the busy strip of Shattuck Avenue lies a somewhat hidden Toss Noodle Bar where one can customize their noodles to their liking.I've tried this place a couple times now and I find the concept to be quite interesting. All in all, it's similar to Pieology and Chipotle, but for noodles. Choose your meats, sauce, type of noodles, and etc. based on your own preferences and they'll make it for you. I've tried various combinations and for the price, I did enjoy what I got though I found that no matter what I chose the enjoyment per bite depreciated very quickly. I feel that Toss is special in it's wide variety of possible combinations, but in that variety, there is a lack of specialization and passion for the food it serves due to it's concept of personal customization. Overall, I would say it's a fun experience to try, but for a good noodle dish, I would prefer a location where the chef understands the flavors and combinations that work to make a fulfilling mix of flavors with personality."
50,"Our family got caught in the pouring rain but thank goodness for Toss Noodle Bar!This eatery serves up noodle dishes, soups and rice bowls in a casual setting. Order up at the counter, pay and grab your own utensils and water. You clean up after yourself too! Why am I a fan of these places? because they keep the costs low. Most dishes are $10 or less!Whether easy or picky eaters, everyone has the freedom to choose whatever combo they want. You choose your base (noodle or rice), add your sauce (laksa, peanut sauce, hoisin, etc) add your meat. Then you can say if you just want it plain stir fry or in a soup. You can get your pho fix here too!I wasn't absurdly hungry so I ordered a bunch of appetizers for myself and for the table: chicken satay ($6), fried croquettes ($5), tofu salad ($4) coconut shrimp ($6).  Everything was cooked just right and had delicious accompanying sauces. Yum.Thanks Toss for keeping our family lunch affordable and fun! There was definitely a choice for everyone."
51,"When I first walked through the doors of Toss, there was a strange odor, almost like wet dog smell. I knew I wasn't alone, because the person I was with, who also happened to be the one who suggested Toss to me, also smelled it. The smell did not last long, it's just not what I was expecting from a restaurant. The menu is very simple. You pick what type of noodles you want (rice also available), then you choose the sauce you want it tossed in, and finally you choose your meat option. I went with wheat noodles, Thai sauce, and chicken. The food came out very quick. The wheat noodles are skinny noodles, which I prefer because it's easier to eat, in my opinion. I love the fresh veggies they use, and the Thai sauce was awesome. We also shared a plate of garlic edamame. The garlic were nice sized pieces, and fresh. The edamame is tossed in soy sauce, which adds another welcome flavor element. The restaurant has a nice, chill vibe to it. They havr a water station, where you can pour your own water, and the water itself is spa water (cucumber slices in it). In the end, they serve great food at a great price."
52,"We were looking for soup on a Thursday night. We couldn't believe how difficult it was to find soup or even a restaurant that's open past 8:30 pm.  This place was perfect. We created a bowl of soup - hokkien noodles, clear soup, and chicken. The waitress brought it to our table; nice and hot with good flavor.  Everything we saw being delivered to customers looked good. There's so many choices in designing your own meal. Stop in and try one; you won't be disappointed."
53,"I really do enjoy the noodles at this restaurant but I'm giving this review only 2 stars because the portion sizes at Toss is very disappointing. I started coming here a couple of years ago and every single time I come, the amount of noodles that actually go into my bowl heavily decreases. Noodles are pretty cheap, I could literally buy 3 noodle plates in Chinatown for less than $15. BUT I'm paying around $10-$13 at Toss for a bowl of noodles that barely reach the middle of my bowl. The last and final time I came here, I ordered the hokkien noodles with Thai sauce and beef, when the lady brought out my noodles, I could literally see the bottom of the bowl... THATS HOW LITTLE NOODLES I GOT! Are you serious Toss? I'm not blind. I had to go up to the cashier and let her know how disappointed I was before a new bowl was brought out to me. Overall, the noodles here are good, but since it seems like a ten dollar bill gets me less than half a bowl of noodles, I'll go spend my money at Imm Thai instead."
54,"I've come here a few times and now and ordered something different each time and have yet to be disappointed! You choose your base first: noodle, rice, or fried rice. There are 5 types of noodles and the option for white or brown rice. Then you pick the flavour you want. There are 5 different stir fry flavours as well as the option to get curry! Finally you pick a protein - tofu is the only vegetarian option and there's also plenty of meat options.I've had curry, fried rice, and noodles and they've all been great! Portion size is good and all the dishes come with plenty of veggies and egg as well. The tofu has also always been well cooked unlike some places where I've experienced semi raw chunks of tofu thrown in. Overall, I love the variety and consistency of their food and I can't wait to try more combos in the future!"
55,"Won't stop until I've tried every single noodle/rice/sauce/meat combination!Toss is seriously SOOOOO bae!  It's a fun process or ordering because you get to pick your own noodles or rice, sauce and meat.  You make exactly what you want to eat and it's all very good quality!There's not much of a customer service aspect here because you order at the counter and then just wait for your food to be brought to you at the table.  I like that there are big pitchers of water for customers though so we can keep one at the table.  I can't stand not having enough beverage with my meal!Toss has the traditional thai restaurant sauces with the chili, jalepenos, etc. but they have one that's a smooth consistency and spicy and it is HEAVEN!!!  If you like spice, DEFINITELY use this to spice up your dishPros: you get to order exactly what you want every time.  There are so many combinations of orders to get here and they're all equally good.cons: people who haven't been tend to order as if they've never heard of food before and might take a while if they're not used to the ordering process here, so beware.  TIP! if you order curry with noodles, I like to ask them to put them together so I don't have to mix in the noodles with the sauce myself.  It lets the noodles absorb more curry sauce.  It's SO good!Toss is definitely a fun place to come with friends for a fun dinner with delicious food and great atmosphere!  The staff is friendly and they make DELICIOUS food that will always leave you wanting to come back again!"
56,"Thai-Hokkien-beef YASS! My go-to noodle bar whenever I'm back in NorCal! You honestly can't go wrong with any combo here. Everything is delicious --even the Tom yum is up to par with my standards. Coconut prawns were also pretty tasty, but nothing to get super hyped about"
57,"Filling noodle dishes for good prices. Toss Noodle Bar made the order process simple: choose one of four different noodles, your meat/tofu, and your sauce. I personally liked the Hokkein noodles with shrimp and peanut sauce. Was quite delicious! Although the restaurant was packed the food came out quick. You gotta clean up after yourself but I'm happily doing so as the noodles were great and the prices aiiiiiright!"
58,"I've come several times in the past and ended up staring at a bunch of flies zooming around the restaurant entrance.  Pretty unappetizing for me...For some reason, a lot of my friends want to come here for dinner so I've been way more times than I would've chosen to.   You can choose your noodles/rice, protein, and sauce (or make it a soup).  The meal comes out to around $10, which is pretty decent.  My favorite combo has to be the the Hokkien noodle with chicken and peanut sauce.  Don't get me wrong.  The food is good.  I just don't really get the hype.  There's generally always a place for you to sit after ordering at the register.  There's cute mason jars for your water needs."
59,"I  usually am a man with the determination to finish any meal I get at restaurants, but when it comes to Toss Noodle Bar's bowls, they are so generous that I can't finish them; however, it's great because that means I can get some of that deliciousness for leftovers. Truly large portions with delicious soups like their sour and spicy tomyum.Honestly, do not come here for anything but the noodles. The curry or stir fry portions are not so filling and they cost as much as the soups because they charge based on the meat, so go for the bowls!Biggest plus is that they do not kick you out for bringing in outside drinks for example.

79,"I  usually am a man with the determination to finish any meal I get at restaurants, but when it comes to Toss Noodle Bar's bowls, they are so generous that I can't finish them; however, it's great because that means I can get some of that deliciousness for leftovers. Truly large portions with delicious soups like their sour and spicy tomyum.Honestly, do not come here for anything but the noodles. The curry or stir fry portions are not so filling and they cost as much as the soups because they charge based on the meat, so go for the bowls!Biggest plus is that they do not kick you out for bringing in outside drinks for example. Come here a lot with friends out of random bursts of cravings and I've come in with coffee or boba and they do not have a problem with that, which is great!"
80,"I love them nooDZ NOODZ nOODZ, noodz i do adooreeseriously this place is amazeballs. I love that you can customize your entire order. I was so excited coming in here because I saw the different variations you can do, as well as the other yummy appetizers they had on the menu! I got the spinach noodles with half malay(peanut) and half thai(spicy) with chicken as my protein. I like that the stir fry option already comes with lots of vegetables and egg. The two sauces combined gave it a nice creamy texture. The thai spicy sauce wasnt spicy at all! The noodles were cooked perfectlyThe bf got the thin rice tom yum soup with chicken. I didnt get to try a lot of it, but the soup was tom yum soup was yummmyyWe also got the TOSS beef salad. I was kinda dejected because I saw a picture of it on the yelp page and it looked really good, like a steak salad. But when it came out, it was more like a vietnamese lemongrass beef salad instead. I really wanted to try their croquette and samosas but when I got there, they didn't have it on their menu! I was kinda disappointed.Anyways it was self serve after they bring you your food. They had cute mason jars for you to fill up at the water station and a bucket to put your dirty bowls. I only noticed this after but if you look at the TOSS symbol, you can notice that the T and O make a wok and the S S are noodles! This is a cheap and easy meal. Parking sucks because it's so crowded and in downtown"
81,"A decent place to grab a quick dinner downtown, and cheaper than most places downtown.It's a build you own noodle/rice bowl, where you select you noodle/rice type, protein, and sauce. I really like the hokkien and spinach noodles (they maintain a good chew), usually with chicken and the Chinese or Japanese sauce. The portions are ok, you don't get a lot of the protein for what you pay, but it's tasty and again, it's much cheaper than most other places downtown. I've also tried their curry, which is alright- I'd still probably go somewhere that's just Thai food like Racha or Thai noodle for curry, but the curry here isn't bad. The restaurant itself is pretty cute, with a good range of tables for small to large groups (you order then seat yourself). One weird thing about it is that there's always flies hovering around the door? Nothing major and they're not inside the restaurant but it isn't the most pleasant experience walking into the restaurant."
82,"This place is an upscale fast food restaurant basically. The service is quick but the food is just alright. Definitely can be a quick fix for comfort food for those Asian college students who miss their parents cooking. You basically have control of what you put in your bowl. There are three options: rice, noodles, or fried rice. From there, you then choose your sauces, veggies, and/or meat. I got the soup with glass noodle, Tom Yum base, and beef. Tasted okay. The soup wasn't as strong like other Thai places and I would have also been okay with not finishing my meal. After you order, it's mostly self service. There's water on the side of the restaurant with cute Mason jars. However this establishment is quite small so I would not recommend large parties."
83,"Noodles for everyone! Toss is a great place to go when you can't decide what type of asian flavor, you particularly want. It's great for a group of people who just can't decide on one type of asian food. Hidden next to UA Berkeley Theaters, Toss is a casual asian fusion restaurant where you are able to combine different noodles, sauces, and meats. I've been to this place throughout my years at Berkeley and it never fails to satisfy my hunger for asian noodles. I usually get the hokkien noodles, which is a thick yellow egg noodles that absorbs the sauce you choose. I've tried most of the sauces but the best one would have to be the Malay peanut sauce. It adds a hearty peanut flavor to the noodles that I haven't seen anywhere else. If you aren't in the mood for any of the sauces the Laska, which is a curry coconut soup is perfect for a cold day. Make sure to ask for spicy or add your own spices, since it usually comes out bland without it. There is also rice dishes, but they never seem to be worth getting. The only complaint I have is that the sauces lack a depth of flavors like restaurants that focus on only one or two noodle dishes. However, for only $10 dollars, Toss has good portions sizes that is good for lunch and dinner!"
84,"Affordable, good place by campus for food. Choose your own noodles, sauce, veggies, meat, etc and they'll make it for you. Portion sizes are good, but nothing's amazing since you have the risk of putting not so great things together. Protip: get what you think you'll like."
85,This is your quick fast casual for noodles. You get to choose the type of noodles sauce and protein I got the hokkien noodles with Thai and Malay with chicken. It came out super quickly and each dish comes in a big bowl. It also comes with a bunch of different vegetables in the dish. It tasted slightly sweet but a little spicy but not too much. I wanted to get extra chili to spice it up! The noodles were stir fry quickly and I can see the wok hey markings on the noodles. It's around $10/$11 for each so it's a quick bite to eat. Just walk in and go directly to the counter. The waiter will give you a number and bring the food to you. Parking is rough in the area. I usually park near YMCA or the park a couple blocks away and walk here. Grab some noodles and walk it off in downtown Berkeley!
86,"Toss Noddle Bar is probably my favorite noodle place in all of Berkeley, and I don't know why I didn't go here since freshman year. TO be honest, I don't even remember what I ordered since I came a while back ago, but all I can tell you is that there isn't anything that can go wrong.Think of it as a subway, for noodles. haha, it's so customizable, and they even let you combine spaces which was pretty neat! This place isn't really great for large groups, which can be a downfall, but groups of 4 are perfect."
87,"I found this little gem while browsing in the search section on Yelp and have been coming back ever since.It is soooooo freaking good OMG. It's a design your own but they do have pre-set items that go in it. For instance, it comes with noodles but you get to pick which style you want. I always get hokkien noodles. They are thick like chow mein for those that are unfamiliar with the names. It comes with meat but you get to choose which one or two you want. Typically I get chicken but I have tried the combo and got chicken and prawn. The prawn wasn't cooked all the way : ( you pick your sauce of choice, I always get the Thai sauce. It's spicey. All noodle options come with veggies.For less than $10 and very filling. Yes! You can't beat that. I gave 4 stars just for the half cooked prawn. It happened both times I ordered the combo so I cannot even say it was an accident the first time. If I had known the shrimp would still be see through i wouldn't have ordered the combo. I ordered it a second time thinking maybe the first time it was an accident, so I tried again. Whomp, same issue. Some people may like it like that, but nah, if I wanted a shrimp cocktail I went somewhere that had that on the menu."
88,"The prices are reasonable and the food is tasty but the place is a little dirty and there are usually some flies around the restaurant. Water is self serve and you're supposed to bring your dishes to the their dish tray when you're done.I ordered the hokkaido noodles with Thai sauce and beef and the portions were fairly large. Overall, it is a pretty good place for a quick and tasty bite that won't break the bank."
89,"Alongside the busy strip of Shattuck Avenue lies a somewhat hidden Toss Noodle Bar where one can customize their noodles to their liking.I've tried this place a couple times now and I find the concept to be quite interesting. All in all, it's similar to Pieology and Chipotle, but for noodles. Choose your meats, sauce, type of noodles, and etc. based on your own preferences and they'll make it for you. I've tried various combinations and for the price, I did enjoy what I got though I found that no matter what I chose the enjoyment per bite depreciated very quickly. I feel that Toss is special in it's wide variety of possible combinations, but in that variety, there is a lack of specialization and passion for the food it serves due to it's concept of personal customization. Overall, I would say it's a fun experience to try, but for a good noodle dish, I would prefer a location where the chef understands the flavors and combinations that work to make a fulfilling mix of flavors with personality."
90,"Our family got caught in the pouring rain but thank goodness for Toss Noodle Bar!This eatery serves up noodle dishes, soups and rice bowls in a casual setting. Order up at the counter, pay and grab your own utensils and water. You clean up after yourself too! Why am I a fan of these places? because they keep the costs low. Most dishes are $10 or less!Whether easy or picky eaters, everyone has the freedom to choose whatever combo they want. You choose your base (noodle or rice), add your sauce (laksa, peanut sauce, hoisin, etc) add your meat. Then you can say if you just want it plain stir fry or in a soup. You can get your pho fix here too!I wasn't absurdly hungry so I ordered a bunch of appetizers for myself and for the table: chicken satay ($6), fried croquettes ($5), tofu salad ($4) coconut shrimp ($6).  Everything was cooked just right and had delicious accompanying sauces. Yum.Thanks Toss for keeping our family lunch affordable and fun! There was definitely a choice for everyone."
91,"When I first walked through the doors of Toss, there was a strange odor, almost like wet dog smell. I knew I wasn't alone, because the person I was with, who also happened to be the one who suggested Toss to me, also smelled it. The smell did not last long, it's just not what I was expecting from a restaurant. The menu is very simple. You pick what type of noodles you want (rice also available), then you choose the sauce you want it tossed in, and finally you choose your meat option. I went with wheat noodles, Thai sauce, and chicken. The food came out very quick. The wheat noodles are skinny noodles, which I prefer because it's easier to eat, in my opinion. I love the fresh veggies they use, and the Thai sauce was awesome. We also shared a plate of garlic edamame. The garlic were nice sized pieces, and fresh. The edamame is tossed in soy sauce, which adds another welcome flavor element. The restaurant has a nice, chill vibe to it. They havr a water station, where you can pour your own water, and the water itself is spa water (cucumber slices in it). In the end, they serve great food at a great price."
92,"We were looking for soup on a Thursday night. We couldn't believe how difficult it was to find soup or even a restaurant that's open past 8:30 pm.  This place was perfect. We created a bowl of soup - hokkien noodles, clear soup, and chicken. The waitress brought it to our table; nice and hot with good flavor.  Everything we saw being delivered to customers looked good. There's so many choices in designing your own meal. Stop in and try one; you won't be disappointed."
93,"I really do enjoy the noodles at this restaurant but I'm giving this review only 2 stars because the portion sizes at Toss is very disappointing. I started coming here a couple of years ago and every single time I come, the amount of noodles that actually go into my bowl heavily decreases. Noodles are pretty cheap, I could literally buy 3 noodle plates in Chinatown for less than $15. BUT I'm paying around $10-$13 at Toss for a bowl of noodles that barely reach the middle of my bowl. The last and final time I came here, I ordered the hokkien noodles with Thai sauce and beef, when the lady brought out my noodles, I could literally see the bottom of the bowl... THATS HOW LITTLE NOODLES I GOT! Are you serious Toss? I'm not blind. I had to go up to the cashier and let her know how disappointed I was before a new bowl was brought out to me. Overall, the noodles here are good, but since it seems like a ten dollar bill gets me less than half a bowl of noodles, I'll go spend my money at Imm Thai instead."
94,"I've come here a few times and now and ordered something different each time and have yet to be disappointed! You choose your base first: noodle, rice, or fried rice. There are 5 types of noodles and the option for white or brown rice. Then you pick the flavour you want. There are 5 different stir fry flavours as well as the option to get curry! Finally you pick a protein - tofu is the only vegetarian option and there's also plenty of meat options.I've had curry, fried rice, and noodles and they've all been great! Portion size is good and all the dishes come with plenty of veggies and egg as well. The tofu has also always been well cooked unlike some places where I've experienced semi raw chunks of tofu thrown in. Overall, I love the variety and consistency of their food and I can't wait to try more combos in the future!"
95,"Won't stop until I've tried every single noodle/rice/sauce/meat combination!Toss is seriously SOOOOO bae!  It's a fun process or ordering because you get to pick your own noodles or rice, sauce and meat.  You make exactly what you want to eat and it's all very good quality!There's not much of a customer service aspect here because you order at the counter and then just wait for your food to be brought to you at the table.  I like that there are big pitchers of water for customers though so we can keep one at the table.  I can't stand not having enough beverage with my meal!Toss has the traditional thai restaurant sauces with the chili, jalepenos, etc. but they have one that's a smooth consistency and spicy and it is HEAVEN!!!  If you like spice, DEFINITELY use this to spice up your dishPros: you get to order exactly what you want every time.  There are so many combinations of orders to get here and they're all equally good.cons: people who haven't been tend to order as if they've never heard of food before and might take a while if they're not used to the ordering process here, so beware.  TIP! if you order curry with noodles, I like to ask them to put them together so I don't have to mix in the noodles with the sauce myself.  It lets the noodles absorb more curry sauce.  It's SO good!Toss is definitely a fun place to come with friends for a fun dinner with delicious food and great atmosphere!  The staff is friendly and they make DELICIOUS food that will always leave you wanting to come back again!"
96,"Thai-Hokkien-beef YASS! My go-to noodle bar whenever I'm back in NorCal! You honestly can't go wrong with any combo here. Everything is delicious --even the Tom yum is up to par with my standards. Coconut prawns were also pretty tasty, but nothing to get super hyped about"
97,"Filling noodle dishes for good prices. Toss Noodle Bar made the order process simple: choose one of four different noodles, your meat/tofu, and your sauce. I personally liked the Hokkein noodles with shrimp and peanut sauce. Was quite delicious! Although the restaurant was packed the food came out quick. You gotta clean up after yourself but I'm happily doing so as the noodles were great and the prices aiiiiiright!"

117,"Filling noodle dishes for good prices. Toss Noodle Bar made the order process simple: choose one of four different noodles, your meat/tofu, and your sauce. I personally liked the Hokkein noodles with shrimp and peanut sauce. Was quite delicious! Although the restaurant was packed the food came out quick. You gotta clean up after yourself but I'm happily doing so as the noodles were great and the prices aiiiiiright!"
118,"I've come several times in the past and ended up staring at a bunch of flies zooming around the restaurant entrance.  Pretty unappetizing for me...For some reason, a lot of my friends want to come here for dinner so I've been way more times than I would've chosen to.   You can choose your noodles/rice, protein, and sauce (or make it a soup).  The meal comes out to around $10, which is pretty decent.  My favorite combo has to be the the Hokkien noodle with chicken and peanut sauce.  Don't get me wrong.  The food is good.  I just don't really get the hype.  There's generally always a place for you to sit after ordering at the register.  There's cute mason jars for your water needs."
119,"I  usually am a man with the determination to finish any meal I get at restaurants, but when it comes to Toss Noodle Bar's bowls, they are so generous that I can't finish them; however, it's great because that means I can get some of that deliciousness for leftovers. Truly large portions with delicious soups like their sour and spicy tomyum.Honestly, do not come here for anything but the noodles. The curry or stir fry portions are not so filling and they cost as much as the soups because they charge based on the meat, so go for the bowls!Biggest plus is that they do not kick you out for bringing in outside drinks for example. Come here a lot with friends out of random bursts of cravings and I've come in with coffee or boba and they do not have a problem with that, which is great!"
120,"I love them nooDZ NOODZ nOODZ, noodz i do adooreeseriously this place is amazeballs. I love that you can customize your entire order. I was so excited coming in here because I saw the different variations you can do, as well as the other yummy appetizers they had on the menu! I got the spinach noodles with half malay(peanut) and half thai(spicy) with chicken as my protein. I like that the stir fry option already comes with lots of vegetables and egg. The two sauces combined gave it a nice creamy texture. The thai spicy sauce wasnt spicy at all! The noodles were cooked perfectlyThe bf got the thin rice tom yum soup with chicken. I didnt get to try a lot of it, but the soup was tom yum soup was yummmyyWe also got the TOSS beef salad. I was kinda dejected because I saw a picture of it on the yelp page and it looked really good, like a steak salad. But when it came out, it was more like a vietnamese lemongrass beef salad instead. I really wanted to try their croquette and samosas but when I got there, they didn't have it on their menu! I was kinda disappointed.Anyways it was self serve after they bring you your food. They had cute mason jars for you to fill up at the water station and a bucket to put your dirty bowls. I only noticed this after but if you look at the TOSS symbol, you can notice that the T and O make a wok and the S S are noodles! This is a cheap and easy meal. Parking sucks because it's so crowded and in downtown"
121,"A decent place to grab a quick dinner downtown, and cheaper than most places downtown.It's a build you own noodle/rice bowl, where you select you noodle/rice type, protein, and sauce. I really like the hokkien and spinach noodles (they maintain a good chew), usually with chicken and the Chinese or Japanese sauce. The portions are ok, you don't get a lot of the protein for what you pay, but it's tasty and again, it's much cheaper than most other places downtown. I've also tried their curry, which is alright- I'd still probably go somewhere that's just Thai food like Racha or Thai noodle for curry, but the curry here isn't bad. The restaurant itself is pretty cute, with a good range of tables for small to large groups (you order then seat yourself). One weird thing about it is that there's always flies hovering around the door? Nothing major and they're not inside the restaurant but it isn't the most pleasant experience walking into the restaurant."
122,"This place is an upscale fast food restaurant basically. The service is quick but the food is just alright. Definitely can be a quick fix for comfort food for those Asian college students who miss their parents cooking. You basically have control of what you put in your bowl. There are three options: rice, noodles, or fried rice. From there, you then choose your sauces, veggies, and/or meat. I got the soup with glass noodle, Tom Yum base, and beef. Tasted okay. The soup wasn't as strong like other Thai places and I would have also been okay with not finishing my meal. After you order, it's mostly self service. There's water on the side of the restaurant with cute Mason jars. However this establishment is quite small so I would not recommend large parties."
123,"Noodles for everyone! Toss is a great place to go when you can't decide what type of asian flavor, you particularly want. It's great for a group of people who just can't decide on one type of asian food. Hidden next to UA Berkeley Theaters, Toss is a casual asian fusion restaurant where you are able to combine different noodles, sauces, and meats. I've been to this place throughout my years at Berkeley and it never fails to satisfy my hunger for asian noodles. I usually get the hokkien noodles, which is a thick yellow egg noodles that absorbs the sauce you choose. I've tried most of the sauces but the best one would have to be the Malay peanut sauce. It adds a hearty peanut flavor to the noodles that I haven't seen anywhere else. If you aren't in the mood for any of the sauces the Laska, which is a curry coconut soup is perfect for a cold day. Make sure to ask for spicy or add your own spices, since it usually comes out bland without it. There is also rice dishes, but they never seem to be worth getting. The only complaint I have is that the sauces lack a depth of flavors like restaurants that focus on only one or two noodle dishes. However, for only $10 dollars, Toss has good portions sizes that is good for lunch and dinner!"
124,"Affordable, good place by campus for food. Choose your own noodles, sauce, veggies, meat, etc and they'll make it for you. Portion sizes are good, but nothing's amazing since you have the risk of putting not so great things together. Protip: get what you think you'll like."
125,This is your quick fast casual for noodles. You get to choose the type of noodles sauce and protein I got the hokkien noodles with Thai and Malay with chicken. It came out super quickly and each dish comes in a big bowl. It also comes with a bunch of different vegetables in the dish. It tasted slightly sweet but a little spicy but not too much. I wanted to get extra chili to spice it up! The noodles were stir fry quickly and I can see the wok hey markings on the noodles. It's around $10/$11 for each so it's a quick bite to eat. Just walk in and go directly to the counter. The waiter will give you a number and bring the food to you. Parking is rough in the area. I usually park near YMCA or the park a couple blocks away and walk here. Grab some noodles and walk it off in downtown Berkeley!
126,"Toss Noddle Bar is probably my favorite noodle place in all of Berkeley, and I don't know why I didn't go here since freshman year. TO be honest, I don't even remember what I ordered since I came a while back ago, but all I can tell you is that there isn't anything that can go wrong.Think of it as a subway, for noodles. haha, it's so customizable, and they even let you combine spaces which was pretty neat! This place isn't really great for large groups, which can be a downfall, but groups of 4 are perfect."
127,"I found this little gem while browsing in the search section on Yelp and have been coming back ever since.It is soooooo freaking good OMG. It's a design your own but they do have pre-set items that go in it. For instance, it comes with noodles but you get to pick which style you want. I always get hokkien noodles. They are thick like chow mein for those that are unfamiliar with the names. It comes with meat but you get to choose which one or two you want. Typically I get chicken but I have tried the combo and got chicken and prawn. The prawn wasn't cooked all the way : ( you pick your sauce of choice, I always get the Thai sauce. It's spicey. All noodle options come with veggies.For less than $10 and very filling. Yes! You can't beat that. I gave 4 stars just for the half cooked prawn. It happened both times I ordered the combo so I cannot even say it was an accident the first time. If I had known the shrimp would still be see through i wouldn't have ordered the combo. I ordered it a second time thinking maybe the first time it was an accident, so I tried again. Whomp, same issue. Some people may like it like that, but nah, if I wanted a shrimp cocktail I went somewhere that had that on the menu."
128,"The prices are reasonable and the food is tasty but the place is a little dirty and there are usually some flies around the restaurant. Water is self serve and you're supposed to bring your dishes to the their dish tray when you're done.I ordered the hokkaido noodles with Thai sauce and beef and the portions were fairly large. Overall, it is a pretty good place for a quick and tasty bite that won't break the bank."
129,"Alongside the busy strip of Shattuck Avenue lies a somewhat hidden Toss Noodle Bar where one can customize their noodles to their liking.I've tried this place a couple times now and I find the concept to be quite interesting. All in all, it's similar to Pieology and Chipotle, but for noodles. Choose your meats, sauce, type of noodles, and etc. based on your own preferences and they'll make it for you. I've tried various combinations and for the price, I did enjoy what I got though I found that no matter what I chose the enjoyment per bite depreciated very quickly. I feel that Toss is special in it's wide variety of possible combinations, but in that variety, there is a lack of specialization and passion for the food it serves due to it's concept of personal customization. Overall, I would say it's a fun experience to try, but for a good noodle dish, I would prefer a location where the chef understands the flavors and combinations that work to make a fulfilling mix of flavors with personality."
130,"Our family got caught in the pouring rain but thank goodness for Toss Noodle Bar!This eatery serves up noodle dishes, soups and rice bowls in a casual setting. Order up at the counter, pay and grab your own utensils and water. You clean up after yourself too! Why am I a fan of these places? because they keep the costs low. Most dishes are $10 or less!Whether easy or picky eaters, everyone has the freedom to choose whatever combo they want. You choose your base (noodle or rice), add your sauce (laksa, peanut sauce, hoisin, etc) add your meat. Then you can say if you just want it plain stir fry or in a soup. You can get your pho fix here too!I wasn't absurdly hungry so I ordered a bunch of appetizers for myself and for the table: chicken satay ($6), fried croquettes ($5), tofu salad ($4) coconut shrimp ($6).  Everything was cooked just right and had delicious accompanying sauces. Yum.Thanks Toss for keeping our family lunch affordable and fun! There was definitely a choice for everyone."
131,"When I first walked through the doors of Toss, there was a strange odor, almost like wet dog smell. I knew I wasn't alone, because the person I was with, who also happened to be the one who suggested Toss to me, also smelled it. The smell did not last long, it's just not what I was expecting from a restaurant. The menu is very simple. You pick what type of noodles you want (rice also available), then you choose the sauce you want it tossed in, and finally you choose your meat option. I went with wheat noodles, Thai sauce, and chicken. The food came out very quick. The wheat noodles are skinny noodles, which I prefer because it's easier to eat, in my opinion. I love the fresh veggies they use, and the Thai sauce was awesome. We also shared a plate of garlic edamame. The garlic were nice sized pieces, and fresh. The edamame is tossed in soy sauce, which adds another welcome flavor element. The restaurant has a nice, chill vibe to it. They havr a water station, where you can pour your own water, and the water itself is spa water (cucumber slices in it). In the end, they serve great food at a great price."
132,"We were looking for soup on a Thursday night. We couldn't believe how difficult it was to find soup or even a restaurant that's open past 8:30 pm.  This place was perfect. We created a bowl of soup - hokkien noodles, clear soup, and chicken. The waitress brought it to our table; nice and hot with good flavor.  Everything we saw being delivered to customers looked good. There's so many choices in designing your own meal. Stop in and try one; you won't be disappointed."
133,"I really do enjoy the noodles at this restaurant but I'm giving this review only 2 stars because the portion sizes at Toss is very disappointing. I started coming here a couple of years ago and every single time I come, the amount of noodles that actually go into my bowl heavily decreases. Noodles are pretty cheap, I could literally buy 3 noodle plates in Chinatown for less than $15. BUT I'm paying around $10-$13 at Toss for a bowl of noodles that barely reach the middle of my bowl. The last and final time I came here, I ordered the hokkien noodles with Thai sauce and beef, when the lady brought out my noodles, I could literally see the bottom of the bowl... THATS HOW LITTLE NOODLES I GOT! Are you serious Toss? I'm not blind. I had to go up to the cashier and let her know how disappointed I was before a new bowl was brought out to me. Overall, the noodles here are good, but since it seems like a ten dollar bill gets me less than half a bowl of noodles, I'll go spend my money at Imm Thai instead."
134,"I've come here a few times and now and ordered something different each time and have yet to be disappointed! You choose your base first: noodle, rice, or fried rice. There are 5 types of noodles and the option for white or brown rice. Then you pick the flavour you want. There are 5 different stir fry flavours as well as the option to get curry! Finally you pick a protein - tofu is the only vegetarian option and there's also plenty of meat options.I've had curry, fried rice, and noodles and they've all been great! Portion size is good and all the dishes come with plenty of veggies and egg as well. The tofu has also always been well cooked unlike some places where I've experienced semi raw chunks of tofu thrown in. Overall, I love the variety and consistency of their food and I can't wait to try more combos in the future!"

Portion size is good and all the dishes come with plenty of veggies and egg as well. The tofu has also always been well cooked unlike some places where I've experienced semi raw chunks of tofu thrown in. Overall, I love the variety and consistency of their food and I can't wait to try more combos in the future!"
155,"Won't stop until I've tried every single noodle/rice/sauce/meat combination!Toss is seriously SOOOOO bae!  It's a fun process or ordering because you get to pick your own noodles or rice, sauce and meat.  You make exactly what you want to eat and it's all very good quality!There's not much of a customer service aspect here because you order at the counter and then just wait for your food to be brought to you at the table.  I like that there are big pitchers of water for customers though so we can keep one at the table.  I can't stand not having enough beverage with my meal!Toss has the traditional thai restaurant sauces with the chili, jalepenos, etc. but they have one that's a smooth consistency and spicy and it is HEAVEN!!!  If you like spice, DEFINITELY use this to spice up your dishPros: you get to order exactly what you want every time.  There are so many combinations of orders to get here and they're all equally good.cons: people who haven't been tend to order as if they've never heard of food before and might take a while if they're not used to the ordering process here, so beware.  TIP! if you order curry with noodles, I like to ask them to put them together so I don't have to mix in the noodles with the sauce myself.  It lets the noodles absorb more curry sauce.  It's SO good!Toss is definitely a fun place to come with friends for a fun dinner with delicious food and great atmosphere!  The staff is friendly and they make DELICIOUS food that will always leave you wanting to come back again!"
156,"Thai-Hokkien-beef YASS! My go-to noodle bar whenever I'm back in NorCal! You honestly can't go wrong with any combo here. Everything is delicious --even the Tom yum is up to par with my standards. Coconut prawns were also pretty tasty, but nothing to get super hyped about"
157,"Filling noodle dishes for good prices. Toss Noodle Bar made the order process simple: choose one of four different noodles, your meat/tofu, and your sauce. I personally liked the Hokkein noodles with shrimp and peanut sauce. Was quite delicious! Although the restaurant was packed the food came out quick. You gotta clean up after yourself but I'm happily doing so as the noodles were great and the prices aiiiiiright!"
158,"I've come several times in the past and ended up staring at a bunch of flies zooming around the restaurant entrance.  Pretty unappetizing for me...For some reason, a lot of my friends want to come here for dinner so I've been way more times than I would've chosen to.   You can choose your noodles/rice, protein, and sauce (or make it a soup).  The meal comes out to around $10, which is pretty decent.  My favorite combo has to be the the Hokkien noodle with chicken and peanut sauce.  Don't get me wrong.  The food is good.  I just don't really get the hype.  There's generally always a place for you to sit after ordering at the register.  There's cute mason jars for your water needs."
159,"I  usually am a man with the determination to finish any meal I get at restaurants, but when it comes to Toss Noodle Bar's bowls, they are so generous that I can't finish them; however, it's great because that means I can get some of that deliciousness for leftovers. Truly large portions with delicious soups like their sour and spicy tomyum.Honestly, do not come here for anything but the noodles. The curry or stir fry portions are not so filling and they cost as much as the soups because they charge based on the meat, so go for the bowls!Biggest plus is that they do not kick you out for bringing in outside drinks for example. Come here a lot with friends out of random bursts of cravings and I've come in with coffee or boba and they do not have a problem with that, which is great!"
160,"I love them nooDZ NOODZ nOODZ, noodz i do adooreeseriously this place is amazeballs. I love that you can customize your entire order. I was so excited coming in here because I saw the different variations you can do, as well as the other yummy appetizers they had on the menu! I got the spinach noodles with half malay(peanut) and half thai(spicy) with chicken as my protein. I like that the stir fry option already comes with lots of vegetables and egg. The two sauces combined gave it a nice creamy texture. The thai spicy sauce wasnt spicy at all! The noodles were cooked perfectlyThe bf got the thin rice tom yum soup with chicken. I didnt get to try a lot of it, but the soup was tom yum soup was yummmyyWe also got the TOSS beef salad. I was kinda dejected because I saw a picture of it on the yelp page and it looked really good, like a steak salad. But when it came out, it was more like a vietnamese lemongrass beef salad instead. I really wanted to try their croquette and samosas but when I got there, they didn't have it on their menu! I was kinda disappointed.Anyways it was self serve after they bring you your food. They had cute mason jars for you to fill up at the water station and a bucket to put your dirty bowls. I only noticed this after but if you look at the TOSS symbol, you can notice that the T and O make a wok and the S S are noodles! This is a cheap and easy meal. Parking sucks because it's so crowded and in downtown"
161,"A decent place to grab a quick dinner downtown, and cheaper than most places downtown.It's a build you own noodle/rice bowl, where you select you noodle/rice type, protein, and sauce. I really like the hokkien and spinach noodles (they maintain a good chew), usually with chicken and the Chinese or Japanese sauce. The portions are ok, you don't get a lot of the protein for what you pay, but it's tasty and again, it's much cheaper than most other places downtown. I've also tried their curry, which is alright- I'd still probably go somewhere that's just Thai food like Racha or Thai noodle for curry, but the curry here isn't bad. The restaurant itself is pretty cute, with a good range of tables for small to large groups (you order then seat yourself). One weird thing about it is that there's always flies hovering around the door? Nothing major and they're not inside the restaurant but it isn't the most pleasant experience walking into the restaurant."
162,"This place is an upscale fast food restaurant basically. The service is quick but the food is just alright. Definitely can be a quick fix for comfort food for those Asian college students who miss their parents cooking. You basically have control of what you put in your bowl. There are three options: rice, noodles, or fried rice. From there, you then choose your sauces, veggies, and/or meat. I got the soup with glass noodle, Tom Yum base, and beef. Tasted okay. The soup wasn't as strong like other Thai places and I would have also been okay with not finishing my meal. After you order, it's mostly self service. There's water on the side of the restaurant with cute Mason jars. However this establishment is quite small so I would not recommend large parties."
163,"Noodles for everyone! Toss is a great place to go when you can't decide what type of asian flavor, you particularly want. It's great for a group of people who just can't decide on one type of asian food. Hidden next to UA Berkeley Theaters, Toss is a casual asian fusion restaurant where you are able to combine different noodles, sauces, and meats. I've been to this place throughout my years at Berkeley and it never fails to satisfy my hunger for asian noodles. I usually get the hokkien noodles, which is a thick yellow egg noodles that absorbs the sauce you choose. I've tried most of the sauces but the best one would have to be the Malay peanut sauce. It adds a hearty peanut flavor to the noodles that I haven't seen anywhere else. If you aren't in the mood for any of the sauces the Laska, which is a curry coconut soup is perfect for a cold day. Make sure to ask for spicy or add your own spices, since it usually comes out bland without it. There is also rice dishes, but they never seem to be worth getting. The only complaint I have is that the sauces lack a depth of flavors like restaurants that focus on only one or two noodle dishes. However, for only $10 dollars, Toss has good portions sizes that is good for lunch and dinner!"
164,"Affordable, good place by campus for food. Choose your own noodles, sauce, veggies, meat, etc and they'll make it for you. Portion sizes are good, but nothing's amazing since you have the risk of putting not so great things together. Protip: get what you think you'll like."
165,This is your quick fast casual for noodles. You get to choose the type of noodles sauce and protein I got the hokkien noodles with Thai and Malay with chicken. It came out super quickly and each dish comes in a big bowl. It also comes with a bunch of different vegetables in the dish. It tasted slightly sweet but a little spicy but not too much. I wanted to get extra chili to spice it up! The noodles were stir fry quickly and I can see the wok hey markings on the noodles. It's around $10/$11 for each so it's a quick bite to eat. Just walk in and go directly to the counter. The waiter will give you a number and bring the food to you. Parking is rough in the area. I usually park near YMCA or the park a couple blocks away and walk here. Grab some noodles and walk it off in downtown Berkeley!
166,"Toss Noddle Bar is probably my favorite noodle place in all of Berkeley, and I don't know why I didn't go here since freshman year. TO be honest, I don't even remember what I ordered since I came a while back ago, but all I can tell you is that there isn't anything that can go wrong.Think of it as a subway, for noodles. haha, it's so customizable, and they even let you combine spaces which was pretty neat! This place isn't really great for large groups, which can be a downfall, but groups of 4 are perfect."
167,"I found this little gem while browsing in the search section on Yelp and have been coming back ever since.It is soooooo freaking good OMG. It's a design your own but they do have pre-set items that go in it. For instance, it comes with noodles but you get to pick which style you want. I always get hokkien noodles. They are thick like chow mein for those that are unfamiliar with the names. It comes with meat but you get to choose which one or two you want. Typically I get chicken but I have tried the combo and got chicken and prawn. The prawn wasn't cooked all the way : ( you pick your sauce of choice, I always get the Thai sauce. It's spicey. All noodle options come with veggies.For less than $10 and very filling. Yes! You can't beat that. I gave 4 stars just for the half cooked prawn. It happened both times I ordered the combo so I cannot even say it was an accident the first time. If I had known the shrimp would still be see through i wouldn't have ordered the combo. I ordered it a second time thinking maybe the first time it was an accident, so I tried again. Whomp, same issue. Some people may like it like that, but nah, if I wanted a shrimp cocktail I went somewhere that had that on the menu."
168,"The prices are reasonable and the food is tasty but the place is a little dirty and there are usually some flies around the restaurant. Water is self serve and you're supposed to bring your dishes to the their dish tray when you're done.I ordered the hokkaido noodles with Thai sauce and beef and the portions were fairly large. Overall, it is a pretty good place for a quick and tasty bite that won't break the bank."
169,"Alongside the busy strip of Shattuck Avenue lies a somewhat hidden Toss Noodle Bar where one can customize their noodles to their liking.I've tried this place a couple times now and I find the concept to be quite interesting. All in all, it's similar to Pieology and Chipotle, but for noodles. Choose your meats, sauce, type of noodles, and etc. based on your own preferences and they'll make it for you. I've tried various combinations and for the price, I did enjoy what I got though I found that no matter what I chose the enjoyment per bite depreciated very quickly. I feel that Toss is special in it's wide variety of possible combinations, but in that variety, there is a lack of specialization and passion for the food it serves due to it's concept of personal customization. Overall, I would say it's a fun experience to try, but for a good noodle dish, I would prefer a location where the chef understands the flavors and combinations that work to make a fulfilling mix of flavors with personality."
170,"Our family got caught in the pouring rain but thank goodness for Toss Noodle Bar!This eatery serves up noodle dishes, soups and rice bowls in a casual setting. Order up at the counter, pay and grab your own utensils and water. You clean up after yourself too! Why am I a fan of these places? because they keep the costs low. Most dishes are $10 or less!Whether easy or picky eaters, everyone has the freedom to choose whatever combo they want. You choose your base (noodle or rice), add your sauce (laksa, peanut sauce, hoisin, etc) add your meat. Then you can say if you just want it plain stir fry or in a soup. You can get your pho fix here too!I wasn't absurdly hungry so I ordered a bunch of appetizers for myself and for the table: chicken satay ($6), fried croquettes ($5), tofu salad ($4) coconut shrimp ($6).  Everything was cooked just right and had delicious accompanying sauces. Yum.Thanks Toss for keeping our family lunch affordable and fun! There was definitely a choice for everyone."
171,"When I first walked through the doors of Toss, there was a strange odor, almost like wet dog smell. I knew I wasn't alone, because the person I was with, who also happened to be the one who suggested Toss to me, also smelled it. The smell did not last long, it's just not what I was expecting from a restaurant. The menu is very simple. You pick what type of noodles you want (rice also available), then you choose the sauce you want it tossed in, and finally you choose your meat option. I went with wheat noodles, Thai sauce, and chicken. The food came out very quick. The wheat noodles are skinny noodles, which I prefer because it's easier to eat, in my opinion. I love the fresh veggies they use, and the Thai sauce was awesome. We also shared a plate of garlic edamame. The garlic were nice sized pieces, and fresh. The edamame is tossed in soy sauce, which adds another welcome flavor element. The restaurant has a nice, chill vibe to it. They havr a water station, where you can pour your own water, and the water itself is spa water (cucumber slices in it). In the end, they serve great food at a great price."
172,"We were looking for soup on a Thursday night. We couldn't believe how difficult it was to find soup or even a restaurant that's open past 8:30 pm.  This place was perfect. We created a bowl of soup - hokkien noodles, clear soup, and chicken. The waitress brought it to our table; nice and hot with good flavor.  Everything we saw being delivered to customers looked good. There's so many choices in designing your own meal. Stop in and try one; you won't be disappointed."
173,"I really do enjoy the noodles at this restaurant but I'm giving this review only 2 stars because the portion sizes at Toss is very disappointing. I started coming here a couple of years ago and every single time I come, the amount of noodles that actually go into my bowl heavily decreases. Noodles are pretty cheap, I could literally buy 3 noodle plates in Chinatown for less than $15. BUT I'm paying around $10-$13 at Toss for a bowl of noodles that barely reach the middle of my bowl. The last and final time I came here, I ordered the hokkien noodles with Thai sauce and beef, when the lady brought out my noodles, I could literally see the bottom of the bowl... THATS HOW LITTLE NOODLES I GOT! Are you serious Toss? I'm not blind. I had to go up to the cashier and let her know how disappointed I was before a new bowl was brought out to me. Overall, the noodles here are good, but since it seems like a ten dollar bill gets me less than half a bowl of noodles, I'll go spend my money at Imm Thai instead."

Overall, the noodles here are good, but since it seems like a ten dollar bill gets me less than half a bowl of noodles, I'll go spend my money at Imm Thai instead."
194,"I've come here a few times and now and ordered something different each time and have yet to be disappointed! You choose your base first: noodle, rice, or fried rice. There are 5 types of noodles and the option for white or brown rice. Then you pick the flavour you want. There are 5 different stir fry flavours as well as the option to get curry! Finally you pick a protein - tofu is the only vegetarian option and there's also plenty of meat options.I've had curry, fried rice, and noodles and they've all been great! Portion size is good and all the dishes come with plenty of veggies and egg as well. The tofu has also always been well cooked unlike some places where I've experienced semi raw chunks of tofu thrown in. Overall, I love the variety and consistency of their food and I can't wait to try more combos in the future!"
195,"Won't stop until I've tried every single noodle/rice/sauce/meat combination!Toss is seriously SOOOOO bae!  It's a fun process or ordering because you get to pick your own noodles or rice, sauce and meat.  You make exactly what you want to eat and it's all very good quality!There's not much of a customer service aspect here because you order at the counter and then just wait for your food to be brought to you at the table.  I like that there are big pitchers of water for customers though so we can keep one at the table.  I can't stand not having enough beverage with my meal!Toss has the traditional thai restaurant sauces with the chili, jalepenos, etc. but they have one that's a smooth consistency and spicy and it is HEAVEN!!!  If you like spice, DEFINITELY use this to spice up your dishPros: you get to order exactly what you want every time.  There are so many combinations of orders to get here and they're all equally good.cons: people who haven't been tend to order as if they've never heard of food before and might take a while if they're not used to the ordering process here, so beware.  TIP! if you order curry with noodles, I like to ask them to put them together so I don't have to mix in the noodles with the sauce myself.  It lets the noodles absorb more curry sauce.  It's SO good!Toss is definitely a fun place to come with friends for a fun dinner with delicious food and great atmosphere!  The staff is friendly and they make DELICIOUS food that will always leave you wanting to come back again!"
196,"Thai-Hokkien-beef YASS! My go-to noodle bar whenever I'm back in NorCal! You honestly can't go wrong with any combo here. Everything is delicious --even the Tom yum is up to par with my standards. Coconut prawns were also pretty tasty, but nothing to get super hyped about"
197,"Filling noodle dishes for good prices. Toss Noodle Bar made the order process simple: choose one of four different noodles, your meat/tofu, and your sauce. I personally liked the Hokkein noodles with shrimp and peanut sauce. Was quite delicious! Although the restaurant was packed the food came out quick. You gotta clean up after yourself but I'm happily doing so as the noodles were great and the prices aiiiiiright!"
198,"I've come several times in the past and ended up staring at a bunch of flies zooming around the restaurant entrance.  Pretty unappetizing for me...For some reason, a lot of my friends want to come here for dinner so I've been way more times than I would've chosen to.   You can choose your noodles/rice, protein, and sauce (or make it a soup).  The meal comes out to around $10, which is pretty decent.  My favorite combo has to be the the Hokkien noodle with chicken and peanut sauce.  Don't get me wrong.  The food is good.  I just don't really get the hype.  There's generally always a place for you to sit after ordering at the register.  There's cute mason jars for your water needs."
199,"I  usually am a man with the determination to finish any meal I get at restaurants, but when it comes to Toss Noodle Bar's bowls, they are so generous that I can't finish them; however, it's great because that means I can get some of that deliciousness for leftovers. Truly large portions with delicious soups like their sour and spicy tomyum.Honestly, do not come here for anything but the noodles. The curry or stir fry portions are not so filling and they cost as much as the soups because they charge based on the meat, so go for the bowls!Biggest plus is that they do not kick you out for bringing in outside drinks for example. Come here a lot with friends out of random bursts of cravings and I've come in with coffee or boba and they do not have a problem with that, which is great!"
200,"I love them nooDZ NOODZ nOODZ, noodz i do adooreeseriously this place is amazeballs. I love that you can customize your entire order. I was so excited coming in here because I saw the different variations you can do, as well as the other yummy appetizers they had on the menu! I got the spinach noodles with half malay(peanut) and half thai(spicy) with chicken as my protein. I like that the stir fry option already comes with lots of vegetables and egg. The two sauces combined gave it a nice creamy texture. The thai spicy sauce wasnt spicy at all! The noodles were cooked perfectlyThe bf got the thin rice tom yum soup with chicken. I didnt get to try a lot of it, but the soup was tom yum soup was yummmyyWe also got the TOSS beef salad. I was kinda dejected because I saw a picture of it on the yelp page and it looked really good, like a steak salad. But when it came out, it was more like a vietnamese lemongrass beef salad instead. I really wanted to try their croquette and samosas but when I got there, they didn't have it on their menu! I was kinda disappointed.Anyways it was self serve after they bring you your food. They had cute mason jars for you to fill up at the water station and a bucket to put your dirty bowls. I only noticed this after but if you look at the TOSS symbol, you can notice that the T and O make a wok and the S S are noodles! This is a cheap and easy meal. Parking sucks because it's so crowded and in downtown"
201,"A decent place to grab a quick dinner downtown, and cheaper than most places downtown.It's a build you own noodle/rice bowl, where you select you noodle/rice type, protein, and sauce. I really like the hokkien and spinach noodles (they maintain a good chew), usually with chicken and the Chinese or Japanese sauce. The portions are ok, you don't get a lot of the protein for what you pay, but it's tasty and again, it's much cheaper than most other places downtown. I've also tried their curry, which is alright- I'd still probably go somewhere that's just Thai food like Racha or Thai noodle for curry, but the curry here isn't bad. The restaurant itself is pretty cute, with a good range of tables for small to large groups (you order then seat yourself). One weird thing about it is that there's always flies hovering around the door? Nothing major and they're not inside the restaurant but it isn't the most pleasant experience walking into the restaurant."
202,"This place is an upscale fast food restaurant basically. The service is quick but the food is just alright. Definitely can be a quick fix for comfort food for those Asian college students who miss their parents cooking. You basically have control of what you put in your bowl. There are three options: rice, noodles, or fried rice. From there, you then choose your sauces, veggies, and/or meat. I got the soup with glass noodle, Tom Yum base, and beef. Tasted okay. The soup wasn't as strong like other Thai places and I would have also been okay with not finishing my meal. After you order, it's mostly self service. There's water on the side of the restaurant with cute Mason jars. However this establishment is quite small so I would not recommend large parties."
203,"Noodles for everyone! Toss is a great place to go when you can't decide what type of asian flavor, you particularly want. It's great for a group of people who just can't decide on one type of asian food. Hidden next to UA Berkeley Theaters, Toss is a casual asian fusion restaurant where you are able to combine different noodles, sauces, and meats. I've been to this place throughout my years at Berkeley and it never fails to satisfy my hunger for asian noodles. I usually get the hokkien noodles, which is a thick yellow egg noodles that absorbs the sauce you choose. I've tried most of the sauces but the best one would have to be the Malay peanut sauce. It adds a hearty peanut flavor to the noodles that I haven't seen anywhere else. If you aren't in the mood for any of the sauces the Laska, which is a curry coconut soup is perfect for a cold day. Make sure to ask for spicy or add your own spices, since it usually comes out bland without it. There is also rice dishes, but they never seem to be worth getting. The only complaint I have is that the sauces lack a depth of flavors like restaurants that focus on only one or two noodle dishes. However, for only $10 dollars, Toss has good portions sizes that is good for lunch and dinner!"
204,"Affordable, good place by campus for food. Choose your own noodles, sauce, veggies, meat, etc and they'll make it for you. Portion sizes are good, but nothing's amazing since you have the risk of putting not so great things together. Protip: get what you think you'll like."
205,This is your quick fast casual for noodles. You get to choose the type of noodles sauce and protein I got the hokkien noodles with Thai and Malay with chicken. It came out super quickly and each dish comes in a big bowl. It also comes with a bunch of different vegetables in the dish. It tasted slightly sweet but a little spicy but not too much. I wanted to get extra chili to spice it up! The noodles were stir fry quickly and I can see the wok hey markings on the noodles. It's around $10/$11 for each so it's a quick bite to eat. Just walk in and go directly to the counter. The waiter will give you a number and bring the food to you. Parking is rough in the area. I usually park near YMCA or the park a couple blocks away and walk here. Grab some noodles and walk it off in downtown Berkeley!
206,"Toss Noddle Bar is probably my favorite noodle place in all of Berkeley, and I don't know why I didn't go here since freshman year. TO be honest, I don't even remember what I ordered since I came a while back ago, but all I can tell you is that there isn't anything that can go wrong.Think of it as a subway, for noodles. haha, it's so customizable, and they even let you combine spaces which was pretty neat! This place isn't really great for large groups, which can be a downfall, but groups of 4 are perfect."
207,"I found this little gem while browsing in the search section on Yelp and have been coming back ever since.It is soooooo freaking good OMG. It's a design your own but they do have pre-set items that go in it. For instance, it comes with noodles but you get to pick which style you want. I always get hokkien noodles. They are thick like chow mein for those that are unfamiliar with the names. It comes with meat but you get to choose which one or two you want. Typically I get chicken but I have tried the combo and got chicken and prawn. The prawn wasn't cooked all the way : ( you pick your sauce of choice, I always get the Thai sauce. It's spicey. All noodle options come with veggies.For less than $10 and very filling. Yes! You can't beat that. I gave 4 stars just for the half cooked prawn. It happened both times I ordered the combo so I cannot even say it was an accident the first time. If I had known the shrimp would still be see through i wouldn't have ordered the combo. I ordered it a second time thinking maybe the first time it was an accident, so I tried again. Whomp, same issue. Some people may like it like that, but nah, if I wanted a shrimp cocktail I went somewhere that had that on the menu."
208,"The prices are reasonable and the food is tasty but the place is a little dirty and there are usually some flies around the restaurant. Water is self serve and you're supposed to bring your dishes to the their dish tray when you're done.I ordered the hokkaido noodles with Thai sauce and beef and the portions were fairly large. Overall, it is a pretty good place for a quick and tasty bite that won't break the bank."
209,"Alongside the busy strip of Shattuck Avenue lies a somewhat hidden Toss Noodle Bar where one can customize their noodles to their liking.I've tried this place a couple times now and I find the concept to be quite interesting. All in all, it's similar to Pieology and Chipotle, but for noodles. Choose your meats, sauce, type of noodles, and etc. based on your own preferences and they'll make it for you. I've tried various combinations and for the price, I did enjoy what I got though I found that no matter what I chose the enjoyment per bite depreciated very quickly. I feel that Toss is special in it's wide variety of possible combinations, but in that variety, there is a lack of specialization and passion for the food it serves due to it's concept of personal customization. Overall, I would say it's a fun experience to try, but for a good noodle dish, I would prefer a location where the chef understands the flavors and combinations that work to make a fulfilling mix of flavors with personality."
210,"Our family got caught in the pouring rain but thank goodness for Toss Noodle Bar!This eatery serves up noodle dishes, soups and rice bowls in a casual setting. Order up at the counter, pay and grab your own utensils and water. You clean up after yourself too! Why am I a fan of these places? because they keep the costs low. Most dishes are $10 or less!Whether easy or picky eaters, everyone has the freedom to choose whatever combo they want. You choose your base (noodle or rice), add your sauce (laksa, peanut sauce, hoisin, etc) add your meat. Then you can say if you just want it plain stir fry or in a soup. You can get your pho fix here too!I wasn't absurdly hungry so I ordered a bunch of appetizers for myself and for the table: chicken satay ($6), fried croquettes ($5), tofu salad ($4) coconut shrimp ($6).  Everything was cooked just right and had delicious accompanying sauces. Yum.Thanks Toss for keeping our family lunch affordable and fun! There was definitely a choice for everyone."
211,"When I first walked through the doors of Toss, there was a strange odor, almost like wet dog smell. I knew I wasn't alone, because the person I was with, who also happened to be the one who suggested Toss to me, also smelled it. The smell did not last long, it's just not what I was expecting from a restaurant. The menu is very simple. You pick what type of noodles you want (rice also available), then you choose the sauce you want it tossed in, and finally you choose your meat option. I went with wheat noodles, Thai sauce, and chicken. The food came out very quick. The wheat noodles are skinny noodles, which I prefer because it's easier to eat, in my opinion. I love the fresh veggies they use, and the Thai sauce was awesome. We also shared a plate of garlic edamame. The garlic were nice sized pieces, and fresh. The edamame is tossed in soy sauce, which adds another welcome flavor element. The restaurant has a nice, chill vibe to it. They havr a water station, where you can pour your own water, and the water itself is spa water (cucumber slices in it). In the end, they serve great food at a great price."
212,"We were looking for soup on a Thursday night. We couldn't believe how difficult it was to find soup or even a restaurant that's open past 8:30 pm.  This place was perfect. We created a bowl of soup - hokkien noodles, clear soup, and chicken. The waitress brought it to our table; nice and hot with good flavor.  Everything we saw being delivered to customers looked good. There's so many choices in designing your own meal. Stop in and try one; you won't be disappointed."
213,"I really do enjoy the noodles at this restaurant but I'm giving this review only 2 stars because the portion sizes at Toss is very disappointing. I started coming here a couple of years ago and every single time I come, the amount of noodles that actually go into my bowl heavily decreases. Noodles are pretty cheap, I could literally buy 3 noodle plates in Chinatown for less than $15. BUT I'm paying around $10-$13 at Toss for a bowl of noodles that barely reach the middle of my bowl. The last and final time I came here, I ordered the hokkien noodles with Thai sauce and beef, when the lady brought out my noodles, I could literally see the bottom of the bowl... THATS HOW LITTLE NOODLES I GOT! Are you serious Toss? I'm not blind. I had to go up to the cashier and let her know how disappointed I was before a new bowl was brought out to me.

I started coming here a couple of years ago and every single time I come, the amount of noodles that actually go into my bowl heavily decreases. Noodles are pretty cheap, I could literally buy 3 noodle plates in Chinatown for less than $15. BUT I'm paying around $10-$13 at Toss for a bowl of noodles that barely reach the middle of my bowl. The last and final time I came here, I ordered the hokkien noodles with Thai sauce and beef, when the lady brought out my noodles, I could literally see the bottom of the bowl... THATS HOW LITTLE NOODLES I GOT! Are you serious Toss? I'm not blind. I had to go up to the cashier and let her know how disappointed I was before a new bowl was brought out to me. Overall, the noodles here are good, but since it seems like a ten dollar bill gets me less than half a bowl of noodles, I'll go spend my money at Imm Thai instead."
234,"I've come here a few times and now and ordered something different each time and have yet to be disappointed! You choose your base first: noodle, rice, or fried rice. There are 5 types of noodles and the option for white or brown rice. Then you pick the flavour you want. There are 5 different stir fry flavours as well as the option to get curry! Finally you pick a protein - tofu is the only vegetarian option and there's also plenty of meat options.I've had curry, fried rice, and noodles and they've all been great! Portion size is good and all the dishes come with plenty of veggies and egg as well. The tofu has also always been well cooked unlike some places where I've experienced semi raw chunks of tofu thrown in. Overall, I love the variety and consistency of their food and I can't wait to try more combos in the future!"
235,"Won't stop until I've tried every single noodle/rice/sauce/meat combination!Toss is seriously SOOOOO bae!  It's a fun process or ordering because you get to pick your own noodles or rice, sauce and meat.  You make exactly what you want to eat and it's all very good quality!There's not much of a customer service aspect here because you order at the counter and then just wait for your food to be brought to you at the table.  I like that there are big pitchers of water for customers though so we can keep one at the table.  I can't stand not having enough beverage with my meal!Toss has the traditional thai restaurant sauces with the chili, jalepenos, etc. but they have one that's a smooth consistency and spicy and it is HEAVEN!!!  If you like spice, DEFINITELY use this to spice up your dishPros: you get to order exactly what you want every time.  There are so many combinations of orders to get here and they're all equally good.cons: people who haven't been tend to order as if they've never heard of food before and might take a while if they're not used to the ordering process here, so beware.  TIP! if you order curry with noodles, I like to ask them to put them together so I don't have to mix in the noodles with the sauce myself.  It lets the noodles absorb more curry sauce.  It's SO good!Toss is definitely a fun place to come with friends for a fun dinner with delicious food and great atmosphere!  The staff is friendly and they make DELICIOUS food that will always leave you wanting to come back again!"
236,"Thai-Hokkien-beef YASS! My go-to noodle bar whenever I'm back in NorCal! You honestly can't go wrong with any combo here. Everything is delicious --even the Tom yum is up to par with my standards. Coconut prawns were also pretty tasty, but nothing to get super hyped about"
237,"Filling noodle dishes for good prices. Toss Noodle Bar made the order process simple: choose one of four different noodles, your meat/tofu, and your sauce. I personally liked the Hokkein noodles with shrimp and peanut sauce. Was quite delicious! Although the restaurant was packed the food came out quick. You gotta clean up after yourself but I'm happily doing so as the noodles were great and the prices aiiiiiright!"
238,"I've come several times in the past and ended up staring at a bunch of flies zooming around the restaurant entrance.  Pretty unappetizing for me...For some reason, a lot of my friends want to come here for dinner so I've been way more times than I would've chosen to.   You can choose your noodles/rice, protein, and sauce (or make it a soup).  The meal comes out to around $10, which is pretty decent.  My favorite combo has to be the the Hokkien noodle with chicken and peanut sauce.  Don't get me wrong.  The food is good.  I just don't really get the hype.  There's generally always a place for you to sit after ordering at the register.  There's cute mason jars for your water needs."
239,"I  usually am a man with the determination to finish any meal I get at restaurants, but when it comes to Toss Noodle Bar's bowls, they are so generous that I can't finish them; however, it's great because that means I can get some of that deliciousness for leftovers. Truly large portions with delicious soups like their sour and spicy tomyum.Honestly, do not come here for anything but the noodles. The curry or stir fry portions are not so filling and they cost as much as the soups because they charge based on the meat, so go for the bowls!Biggest plus is that they do not kick you out for bringing in outside drinks for example. Come here a lot with friends out of random bursts of cravings and I've come in with coffee or boba and they do not have a problem with that, which is great!"
240,"I love them nooDZ NOODZ nOODZ, noodz i do adooreeseriously this place is amazeballs. I love that you can customize your entire order. I was so excited coming in here because I saw the different variations you can do, as well as the other yummy appetizers they had on the menu! I got the spinach noodles with half malay(peanut) and half thai(spicy) with chicken as my protein. I like that the stir fry option already comes with lots of vegetables and egg. The two sauces combined gave it a nice creamy texture. The thai spicy sauce wasnt spicy at all! The noodles were cooked perfectlyThe bf got the thin rice tom yum soup with chicken. I didnt get to try a lot of it, but the soup was tom yum soup was yummmyyWe also got the TOSS beef salad. I was kinda dejected because I saw a picture of it on the yelp page and it looked really good, like a steak salad. But when it came out, it was more like a vietnamese lemongrass beef salad instead. I really wanted to try their croquette and samosas but when I got there, they didn't have it on their menu! I was kinda disappointed.Anyways it was self serve after they bring you your food. They had cute mason jars for you to fill up at the water station and a bucket to put your dirty bowls. I only noticed this after but if you look at the TOSS symbol, you can notice that the T and O make a wok and the S S are noodles! This is a cheap and easy meal. Parking sucks because it's so crowded and in downtown"
241,"A decent place to grab a quick dinner downtown, and cheaper than most places downtown.It's a build you own noodle/rice bowl, where you select you noodle/rice type, protein, and sauce. I really like the hokkien and spinach noodles (they maintain a good chew), usually with chicken and the Chinese or Japanese sauce. The portions are ok, you don't get a lot of the protein for what you pay, but it's tasty and again, it's much cheaper than most other places downtown. I've also tried their curry, which is alright- I'd still probably go somewhere that's just Thai food like Racha or Thai noodle for curry, but the curry here isn't bad. The restaurant itself is pretty cute, with a good range of tables for small to large groups (you order then seat yourself). One weird thing about it is that there's always flies hovering around the door? Nothing major and they're not inside the restaurant but it isn't the most pleasant experience walking into the restaurant."
242,"This place is an upscale fast food restaurant basically. The service is quick but the food is just alright. Definitely can be a quick fix for comfort food for those Asian college students who miss their parents cooking. You basically have control of what you put in your bowl. There are three options: rice, noodles, or fried rice. From there, you then choose your sauces, veggies, and/or meat. I got the soup with glass noodle, Tom Yum base, and beef. Tasted okay. The soup wasn't as strong like other Thai places and I would have also been okay with not finishing my meal. After you order, it's mostly self service. There's water on the side of the restaurant with cute Mason jars. However this establishment is quite small so I would not recommend large parties."
243,"Noodles for everyone! Toss is a great place to go when you can't decide what type of asian flavor, you particularly want. It's great for a group of people who just can't decide on one type of asian food. Hidden next to UA Berkeley Theaters, Toss is a casual asian fusion restaurant where you are able to combine different noodles, sauces, and meats. I've been to this place throughout my years at Berkeley and it never fails to satisfy my hunger for asian noodles. I usually get the hokkien noodles, which is a thick yellow egg noodles that absorbs the sauce you choose. I've tried most of the sauces but the best one would have to be the Malay peanut sauce. It adds a hearty peanut flavor to the noodles that I haven't seen anywhere else. If you aren't in the mood for any of the sauces the Laska, which is a curry coconut soup is perfect for a cold day. Make sure to ask for spicy or add your own spices, since it usually comes out bland without it. There is also rice dishes, but they never seem to be worth getting. The only complaint I have is that the sauces lack a depth of flavors like restaurants that focus on only one or two noodle dishes. However, for only $10 dollars, Toss has good portions sizes that is good for lunch and dinner!"
244,"Affordable, good place by campus for food. Choose your own noodles, sauce, veggies, meat, etc and they'll make it for you. Portion sizes are good, but nothing's amazing since you have the risk of putting not so great things together. Protip: get what you think you'll like."
245,This is your quick fast casual for noodles. You get to choose the type of noodles sauce and protein I got the hokkien noodles with Thai and Malay with chicken. It came out super quickly and each dish comes in a big bowl. It also comes with a bunch of different vegetables in the dish. It tasted slightly sweet but a little spicy but not too much. I wanted to get extra chili to spice it up! The noodles were stir fry quickly and I can see the wok hey markings on the noodles. It's around $10/$11 for each so it's a quick bite to eat. Just walk in and go directly to the counter. The waiter will give you a number and bring the food to you. Parking is rough in the area. I usually park near YMCA or the park a couple blocks away and walk here. Grab some noodles and walk it off in downtown Berkeley!
246,"Toss Noddle Bar is probably my favorite noodle place in all of Berkeley, and I don't know why I didn't go here since freshman year. TO be honest, I don't even remember what I ordered since I came a while back ago, but all I can tell you is that there isn't anything that can go wrong.Think of it as a subway, for noodles. haha, it's so customizable, and they even let you combine spaces which was pretty neat! This place isn't really great for large groups, which can be a downfall, but groups of 4 are perfect."
247,"I found this little gem while browsing in the search section on Yelp and have been coming back ever since.It is soooooo freaking good OMG. It's a design your own but they do have pre-set items that go in it. For instance, it comes with noodles but you get to pick which style you want. I always get hokkien noodles. They are thick like chow mein for those that are unfamiliar with the names. It comes with meat but you get to choose which one or two you want. Typically I get chicken but I have tried the combo and got chicken and prawn. The prawn wasn't cooked all the way : ( you pick your sauce of choice, I always get the Thai sauce. It's spicey. All noodle options come with veggies.For less than $10 and very filling. Yes! You can't beat that. I gave 4 stars just for the half cooked prawn. It happened both times I ordered the combo so I cannot even say it was an accident the first time. If I had known the shrimp would still be see through i wouldn't have ordered the combo. I ordered it a second time thinking maybe the first time it was an accident, so I tried again. Whomp, same issue. Some people may like it like that, but nah, if I wanted a shrimp cocktail I went somewhere that had that on the menu."
248,"The prices are reasonable and the food is tasty but the place is a little dirty and there are usually some flies around the restaurant. Water is self serve and you're supposed to bring your dishes to the their dish tray when you're done.I ordered the hokkaido noodles with Thai sauce and beef and the portions were fairly large. Overall, it is a pretty good place for a quick and tasty bite that won't break the bank."
249,"Alongside the busy strip of Shattuck Avenue lies a somewhat hidden Toss Noodle Bar where one can customize their noodles to their liking.I've tried this place a couple times now and I find the concept to be quite interesting. All in all, it's similar to Pieology and Chipotle, but for noodles. Choose your meats, sauce, type of noodles, and etc. based on your own preferences and they'll make it for you. I've tried various combinations and for the price, I did enjoy what I got though I found that no matter what I chose the enjoyment per bite depreciated very quickly. I feel that Toss is special in it's wide variety of possible combinations, but in that variety, there is a lack of specialization and passion for the food it serves due to it's concept of personal customization. Overall, I would say it's a fun experience to try, but for a good noodle dish, I would prefer a location where the chef understands the flavors and combinations that work to make a fulfilling mix of flavors with personality."
250,"Our family got caught in the pouring rain but thank goodness for Toss Noodle Bar!This eatery serves up noodle dishes, soups and rice bowls in a casual setting. Order up at the counter, pay and grab your own utensils and water. You clean up after yourself too! Why am I a fan of these places? because they keep the costs low. Most dishes are $10 or less!Whether easy or picky eaters, everyone has the freedom to choose whatever combo they want. You choose your base (noodle or rice), add your sauce (laksa, peanut sauce, hoisin, etc) add your meat. Then you can say if you just want it plain stir fry or in a soup. You can get your pho fix here too!I wasn't absurdly hungry so I ordered a bunch of appetizers for myself and for the table: chicken satay ($6), fried croquettes ($5), tofu salad ($4) coconut shrimp ($6).  Everything was cooked just right and had delicious accompanying sauces. Yum.Thanks Toss for keeping our family lunch affordable and fun! There was definitely a choice for everyone."
251,"When I first walked through the doors of Toss, there was a strange odor, almost like wet dog smell. I knew I wasn't alone, because the person I was with, who also happened to be the one who suggested Toss to me, also smelled it. The smell did not last long, it's just not what I was expecting from a restaurant. The menu is very simple. You pick what type of noodles you want (rice also available), then you choose the sauce you want it tossed in, and finally you choose your meat option. I went with wheat noodles, Thai sauce, and chicken. The food came out very quick. The wheat noodles are skinny noodles, which I prefer because it's easier to eat, in my opinion. I love the fresh veggies they use, and the Thai sauce was awesome. We also shared a plate of garlic edamame. The garlic were nice sized pieces, and fresh. The edamame is tossed in soy sauce, which adds another welcome flavor element. The restaurant has a nice, chill vibe to it. They havr a water station, where you can pour your own water, and the water itself is spa water (cucumber slices in it). In the end, they serve great food at a great price."
252,"We were looking for soup on a Thursday night. We couldn't believe how difficult it was to find soup or even a restaurant that's open past 8:30 pm.  This place was perfect. We created a bowl of soup - hokkien noodles, clear soup, and chicken. The waitress brought it to our table; nice and hot with good flavor.  Everything we saw being delivered to customers looked good. There's so many choices in designing your own meal. Stop in and try one; you won't be disappointed."

272,"We were looking for soup on a Thursday night. We couldn't believe how difficult it was to find soup or even a restaurant that's open past 8:30 pm.  This place was perfect. We created a bowl of soup - hokkien noodles, clear soup, and chicken. The waitress brought it to our table; nice and hot with good flavor.  Everything we saw being delivered to customers looked good. There's so many choices in designing your own meal. Stop in and try one; you won't be disappointed."
273,"I really do enjoy the noodles at this restaurant but I'm giving this review only 2 stars because the portion sizes at Toss is very disappointing. I started coming here a couple of years ago and every single time I come, the amount of noodles that actually go into my bowl heavily decreases. Noodles are pretty cheap, I could literally buy 3 noodle plates in Chinatown for less than $15. BUT I'm paying around $10-$13 at Toss for a bowl of noodles that barely reach the middle of my bowl. The last and final time I came here, I ordered the hokkien noodles with Thai sauce and beef, when the lady brought out my noodles, I could literally see the bottom of the bowl... THATS HOW LITTLE NOODLES I GOT! Are you serious Toss? I'm not blind. I had to go up to the cashier and let her know how disappointed I was before a new bowl was brought out to me. Overall, the noodles here are good, but since it seems like a ten dollar bill gets me less than half a bowl of noodles, I'll go spend my money at Imm Thai instead."
274,"I've come here a few times and now and ordered something different each time and have yet to be disappointed! You choose your base first: noodle, rice, or fried rice. There are 5 types of noodles and the option for white or brown rice. Then you pick the flavour you want. There are 5 different stir fry flavours as well as the option to get curry! Finally you pick a protein - tofu is the only vegetarian option and there's also plenty of meat options.I've had curry, fried rice, and noodles and they've all been great! Portion size is good and all the dishes come with plenty of veggies and egg as well. The tofu has also always been well cooked unlike some places where I've experienced semi raw chunks of tofu thrown in. Overall, I love the variety and consistency of their food and I can't wait to try more combos in the future!"
275,"Won't stop until I've tried every single noodle/rice/sauce/meat combination!Toss is seriously SOOOOO bae!  It's a fun process or ordering because you get to pick your own noodles or rice, sauce and meat.  You make exactly what you want to eat and it's all very good quality!There's not much of a customer service aspect here because you order at the counter and then just wait for your food to be brought to you at the table.  I like that there are big pitchers of water for customers though so we can keep one at the table.  I can't stand not having enough beverage with my meal!Toss has the traditional thai restaurant sauces with the chili, jalepenos, etc. but they have one that's a smooth consistency and spicy and it is HEAVEN!!!  If you like spice, DEFINITELY use this to spice up your dishPros: you get to order exactly what you want every time.  There are so many combinations of orders to get here and they're all equally good.cons: people who haven't been tend to order as if they've never heard of food before and might take a while if they're not used to the ordering process here, so beware.  TIP! if you order curry with noodles, I like to ask them to put them together so I don't have to mix in the noodles with the sauce myself.  It lets the noodles absorb more curry sauce.  It's SO good!Toss is definitely a fun place to come with friends for a fun dinner with delicious food and great atmosphere!  The staff is friendly and they make DELICIOUS food that will always leave you wanting to come back again!"
276,"Thai-Hokkien-beef YASS! My go-to noodle bar whenever I'm back in NorCal! You honestly can't go wrong with any combo here. Everything is delicious --even the Tom yum is up to par with my standards. Coconut prawns were also pretty tasty, but nothing to get super hyped about"
277,"Filling noodle dishes for good prices. Toss Noodle Bar made the order process simple: choose one of four different noodles, your meat/tofu, and your sauce. I personally liked the Hokkein noodles with shrimp and peanut sauce. Was quite delicious! Although the restaurant was packed the food came out quick. You gotta clean up after yourself but I'm happily doing so as the noodles were great and the prices aiiiiiright!"
278,"I've come several times in the past and ended up staring at a bunch of flies zooming around the restaurant entrance.  Pretty unappetizing for me...For some reason, a lot of my friends want to come here for dinner so I've been way more times than I would've chosen to.   You can choose your noodles/rice, protein, and sauce (or make it a soup).  The meal comes out to around $10, which is pretty decent.  My favorite combo has to be the the Hokkien noodle with chicken and peanut sauce.  Don't get me wrong.  The food is good.  I just don't really get the hype.  There's generally always a place for you to sit after ordering at the register.  There's cute mason jars for your water needs."
279,"I  usually am a man with the determination to finish any meal I get at restaurants, but when it comes to Toss Noodle Bar's bowls, they are so generous that I can't finish them; however, it's great because that means I can get some of that deliciousness for leftovers. Truly large portions with delicious soups like their sour and spicy tomyum.Honestly, do not come here for anything but the noodles. The curry or stir fry portions are not so filling and they cost as much as the soups because they charge based on the meat, so go for the bowls!Biggest plus is that they do not kick you out for bringing in outside drinks for example. Come here a lot with friends out of random bursts of cravings and I've come in with coffee or boba and they do not have a problem with that, which is great!"
280,"I love them nooDZ NOODZ nOODZ, noodz i do adooreeseriously this place is amazeballs. I love that you can customize your entire order. I was so excited coming in here because I saw the different variations you can do, as well as the other yummy appetizers they had on the menu! I got the spinach noodles with half malay(peanut) and half thai(spicy) with chicken as my protein. I like that the stir fry option already comes with lots of vegetables and egg. The two sauces combined gave it a nice creamy texture. The thai spicy sauce wasnt spicy at all! The noodles were cooked perfectlyThe bf got the thin rice tom yum soup with chicken. I didnt get to try a lot of it, but the soup was tom yum soup was yummmyyWe also got the TOSS beef salad. I was kinda dejected because I saw a picture of it on the yelp page and it looked really good, like a steak salad. But when it came out, it was more like a vietnamese lemongrass beef salad instead. I really wanted to try their croquette and samosas but when I got there, they didn't have it on their menu! I was kinda disappointed.Anyways it was self serve after they bring you your food. They had cute mason jars for you to fill up at the water station and a bucket to put your dirty bowls. I only noticed this after but if you look at the TOSS symbol, you can notice that the T and O make a wok and the S S are noodles! This is a cheap and easy meal. Parking sucks because it's so crowded and in downtown"
281,"A decent place to grab a quick dinner downtown, and cheaper than most places downtown.It's a build you own noodle/rice bowl, where you select you noodle/rice type, protein, and sauce. I really like the hokkien and spinach noodles (they maintain a good chew), usually with chicken and the Chinese or Japanese sauce. The portions are ok, you don't get a lot of the protein for what you pay, but it's tasty and again, it's much cheaper than most other places downtown. I've also tried their curry, which is alright- I'd still probably go somewhere that's just Thai food like Racha or Thai noodle for curry, but the curry here isn't bad. The restaurant itself is pretty cute, with a good range of tables for small to large groups (you order then seat yourself). One weird thing about it is that there's always flies hovering around the door? Nothing major and they're not inside the restaurant but it isn't the most pleasant experience walking into the restaurant."
282,"This place is an upscale fast food restaurant basically. The service is quick but the food is just alright. Definitely can be a quick fix for comfort food for those Asian college students who miss their parents cooking. You basically have control of what you put in your bowl. There are three options: rice, noodles, or fried rice. From there, you then choose your sauces, veggies, and/or meat. I got the soup with glass noodle, Tom Yum base, and beef. Tasted okay. The soup wasn't as strong like other Thai places and I would have also been okay with not finishing my meal. After you order, it's mostly self service. There's water on the side of the restaurant with cute Mason jars. However this establishment is quite small so I would not recommend large parties."
283,"Noodles for everyone! Toss is a great place to go when you can't decide what type of asian flavor, you particularly want. It's great for a group of people who just can't decide on one type of asian food. Hidden next to UA Berkeley Theaters, Toss is a casual asian fusion restaurant where you are able to combine different noodles, sauces, and meats. I've been to this place throughout my years at Berkeley and it never fails to satisfy my hunger for asian noodles. I usually get the hokkien noodles, which is a thick yellow egg noodles that absorbs the sauce you choose. I've tried most of the sauces but the best one would have to be the Malay peanut sauce. It adds a hearty peanut flavor to the noodles that I haven't seen anywhere else. If you aren't in the mood for any of the sauces the Laska, which is a curry coconut soup is perfect for a cold day. Make sure to ask for spicy or add your own spices, since it usually comes out bland without it. There is also rice dishes, but they never seem to be worth getting. The only complaint I have is that the sauces lack a depth of flavors like restaurants that focus on only one or two noodle dishes. However, for only $10 dollars, Toss has good portions sizes that is good for lunch and dinner!"
284,"Affordable, good place by campus for food. Choose your own noodles, sauce, veggies, meat, etc and they'll make it for you. Portion sizes are good, but nothing's amazing since you have the risk of putting not so great things together. Protip: get what you think you'll like."
285,This is your quick fast casual for noodles. You get to choose the type of noodles sauce and protein I got the hokkien noodles with Thai and Malay with chicken. It came out super quickly and each dish comes in a big bowl. It also comes with a bunch of different vegetables in the dish. It tasted slightly sweet but a little spicy but not too much. I wanted to get extra chili to spice it up! The noodles were stir fry quickly and I can see the wok hey markings on the noodles. It's around $10/$11 for each so it's a quick bite to eat. Just walk in and go directly to the counter. The waiter will give you a number and bring the food to you. Parking is rough in the area. I usually park near YMCA or the park a couple blocks away and walk here. Grab some noodles and walk it off in downtown Berkeley!
286,"Toss Noddle Bar is probably my favorite noodle place in all of Berkeley, and I don't know why I didn't go here since freshman year. TO be honest, I don't even remember what I ordered since I came a while back ago, but all I can tell you is that there isn't anything that can go wrong.Think of it as a subway, for noodles. haha, it's so customizable, and they even let you combine spaces which was pretty neat! This place isn't really great for large groups, which can be a downfall, but groups of 4 are perfect."
287,"I found this little gem while browsing in the search section on Yelp and have been coming back ever since.It is soooooo freaking good OMG. It's a design your own but they do have pre-set items that go in it. For instance, it comes with noodles but you get to pick which style you want. I always get hokkien noodles. They are thick like chow mein for those that are unfamiliar with the names. It comes with meat but you get to choose which one or two you want. Typically I get chicken but I have tried the combo and got chicken and prawn. The prawn wasn't cooked all the way : ( you pick your sauce of choice, I always get the Thai sauce. It's spicey. All noodle options come with veggies.For less than $10 and very filling. Yes! You can't beat that. I gave 4 stars just for the half cooked prawn. It happened both times I ordered the combo so I cannot even say it was an accident the first time. If I had known the shrimp would still be see through i wouldn't have ordered the combo. I ordered it a second time thinking maybe the first time it was an accident, so I tried again. Whomp, same issue. Some people may like it like that, but nah, if I wanted a shrimp cocktail I went somewhere that had that on the menu."
288,"The prices are reasonable and the food is tasty but the place is a little dirty and there are usually some flies around the restaurant. Water is self serve and you're supposed to bring your dishes to the their dish tray when you're done.I ordered the hokkaido noodles with Thai sauce and beef and the portions were fairly large. Overall, it is a pretty good place for a quick and tasty bite that won't break the bank."
289,"Alongside the busy strip of Shattuck Avenue lies a somewhat hidden Toss Noodle Bar where one can customize their noodles to their liking.I've tried this place a couple times now and I find the concept to be quite interesting. All in all, it's similar to Pieology and Chipotle, but for noodles. Choose your meats, sauce, type of noodles, and etc. based on your own preferences and they'll make it for you. I've tried various combinations and for the price, I did enjoy what I got though I found that no matter what I chose the enjoyment per bite depreciated very quickly. I feel that Toss is special in it's wide variety of possible combinations, but in that variety, there is a lack of specialization and passion for the food it serves due to it's concept of personal customization. Overall, I would say it's a fun experience to try, but for a good noodle dish, I would prefer a location where the chef understands the flavors and combinations that work to make a fulfilling mix of flavors with personality."
290,"Our family got caught in the pouring rain but thank goodness for Toss Noodle Bar!This eatery serves up noodle dishes, soups and rice bowls in a casual setting. Order up at the counter, pay and grab your own utensils and water. You clean up after yourself too! Why am I a fan of these places? because they keep the costs low. Most dishes are $10 or less!Whether easy or picky eaters, everyone has the freedom to choose whatever combo they want. You choose your base (noodle or rice), add your sauce (laksa, peanut sauce, hoisin, etc) add your meat. Then you can say if you just want it plain stir fry or in a soup. You can get your pho fix here too!I wasn't absurdly hungry so I ordered a bunch of appetizers for myself and for the table: chicken satay ($6), fried croquettes ($5), tofu salad ($4) coconut shrimp ($6).  Everything was cooked just right and had delicious accompanying sauces. Yum.Thanks Toss for keeping our family lunch affordable and fun! There was definitely a choice for everyone."
291,"When I first walked through the doors of Toss, there was a strange odor, almost like wet dog smell. I knew I wasn't alone, because the person I was with, who also happened to be the one who suggested Toss to me, also smelled it. The smell did not last long, it's just not what I was expecting from a restaurant. The menu is very simple. You pick what type of noodles you want (rice also available), then you choose the sauce you want it tossed in, and finally you choose your meat option. I went with wheat noodles, Thai sauce, and chicken. The food came out very quick. The wheat noodles are skinny noodles, which I prefer because it's easier to eat, in my opinion. I love the fresh veggies they use, and the Thai sauce was awesome. We also shared a plate of garlic edamame. The garlic were nice sized pieces, and fresh. The edamame is tossed in soy sauce, which adds another welcome flavor element. The restaurant has a nice, chill vibe to it. They havr a water station, where you can pour your own water, and the water itself is spa water (cucumber slices in it). In the end, they serve great food at a great price."

I went with wheat noodles, Thai sauce, and chicken. The food came out very quick. The wheat noodles are skinny noodles, which I prefer because it's easier to eat, in my opinion. I love the fresh veggies they use, and the Thai sauce was awesome. We also shared a plate of garlic edamame. The garlic were nice sized pieces, and fresh. The edamame is tossed in soy sauce, which adds another welcome flavor element. The restaurant has a nice, chill vibe to it. They havr a water station, where you can pour your own water, and the water itself is spa water (cucumber slices in it). In the end, they serve great food at a great price."
312,"We were looking for soup on a Thursday night. We couldn't believe how difficult it was to find soup or even a restaurant that's open past 8:30 pm.  This place was perfect. We created a bowl of soup - hokkien noodles, clear soup, and chicken. The waitress brought it to our table; nice and hot with good flavor.  Everything we saw being delivered to customers looked good. There's so many choices in designing your own meal. Stop in and try one; you won't be disappointed."
313,"I really do enjoy the noodles at this restaurant but I'm giving this review only 2 stars because the portion sizes at Toss is very disappointing. I started coming here a couple of years ago and every single time I come, the amount of noodles that actually go into my bowl heavily decreases. Noodles are pretty cheap, I could literally buy 3 noodle plates in Chinatown for less than $15. BUT I'm paying around $10-$13 at Toss for a bowl of noodles that barely reach the middle of my bowl. The last and final time I came here, I ordered the hokkien noodles with Thai sauce and beef, when the lady brought out my noodles, I could literally see the bottom of the bowl... THATS HOW LITTLE NOODLES I GOT! Are you serious Toss? I'm not blind. I had to go up to the cashier and let her know how disappointed I was before a new bowl was brought out to me. Overall, the noodles here are good, but since it seems like a ten dollar bill gets me less than half a bowl of noodles, I'll go spend my money at Imm Thai instead."
314,"I've come here a few times and now and ordered something different each time and have yet to be disappointed! You choose your base first: noodle, rice, or fried rice. There are 5 types of noodles and the option for white or brown rice. Then you pick the flavour you want. There are 5 different stir fry flavours as well as the option to get curry! Finally you pick a protein - tofu is the only vegetarian option and there's also plenty of meat options.I've had curry, fried rice, and noodles and they've all been great! Portion size is good and all the dishes come with plenty of veggies and egg as well. The tofu has also always been well cooked unlike some places where I've experienced semi raw chunks of tofu thrown in. Overall, I love the variety and consistency of their food and I can't wait to try more combos in the future!"
315,"Won't stop until I've tried every single noodle/rice/sauce/meat combination!Toss is seriously SOOOOO bae!  It's a fun process or ordering because you get to pick your own noodles or rice, sauce and meat.  You make exactly what you want to eat and it's all very good quality!There's not much of a customer service aspect here because you order at the counter and then just wait for your food to be brought to you at the table.  I like that there are big pitchers of water for customers though so we can keep one at the table.  I can't stand not having enough beverage with my meal!Toss has the traditional thai restaurant sauces with the chili, jalepenos, etc. but they have one that's a smooth consistency and spicy and it is HEAVEN!!!  If you like spice, DEFINITELY use this to spice up your dishPros: you get to order exactly what you want every time.  There are so many combinations of orders to get here and they're all equally good.cons: people who haven't been tend to order as if they've never heard of food before and might take a while if they're not used to the ordering process here, so beware.  TIP! if you order curry with noodles, I like to ask them to put them together so I don't have to mix in the noodles with the sauce myself.  It lets the noodles absorb more curry sauce.  It's SO good!Toss is definitely a fun place to come with friends for a fun dinner with delicious food and great atmosphere!  The staff is friendly and they make DELICIOUS food that will always leave you wanting to come back again!"
316,"Thai-Hokkien-beef YASS! My go-to noodle bar whenever I'm back in NorCal! You honestly can't go wrong with any combo here. Everything is delicious --even the Tom yum is up to par with my standards. Coconut prawns were also pretty tasty, but nothing to get super hyped about"
317,"Filling noodle dishes for good prices. Toss Noodle Bar made the order process simple: choose one of four different noodles, your meat/tofu, and your sauce. I personally liked the Hokkein noodles with shrimp and peanut sauce. Was quite delicious! Although the restaurant was packed the food came out quick. You gotta clean up after yourself but I'm happily doing so as the noodles were great and the prices aiiiiiright!"
318,"I've come several times in the past and ended up staring at a bunch of flies zooming around the restaurant entrance.  Pretty unappetizing for me...For some reason, a lot of my friends want to come here for dinner so I've been way more times than I would've chosen to.   You can choose your noodles/rice, protein, and sauce (or make it a soup).  The meal comes out to around $10, which is pretty decent.  My favorite combo has to be the the Hokkien noodle with chicken and peanut sauce.  Don't get me wrong.  The food is good.  I just don't really get the hype.  There's generally always a place for you to sit after ordering at the register.  There's cute mason jars for your water needs."
319,"I  usually am a man with the determination to finish any meal I get at restaurants, but when it comes to Toss Noodle Bar's bowls, they are so generous that I can't finish them; however, it's great because that means I can get some of that deliciousness for leftovers. Truly large portions with delicious soups like their sour and spicy tomyum.Honestly, do not come here for anything but the noodles. The curry or stir fry portions are not so filling and they cost as much as the soups because they charge based on the meat, so go for the bowls!Biggest plus is that they do not kick you out for bringing in outside drinks for example. Come here a lot with friends out of random bursts of cravings and I've come in with coffee or boba and they do not have a problem with that, which is great!"
320,"I love them nooDZ NOODZ nOODZ, noodz i do adooreeseriously this place is amazeballs. I love that you can customize your entire order. I was so excited coming in here because I saw the different variations you can do, as well as the other yummy appetizers they had on the menu! I got the spinach noodles with half malay(peanut) and half thai(spicy) with chicken as my protein. I like that the stir fry option already comes with lots of vegetables and egg. The two sauces combined gave it a nice creamy texture. The thai spicy sauce wasnt spicy at all! The noodles were cooked perfectlyThe bf got the thin rice tom yum soup with chicken. I didnt get to try a lot of it, but the soup was tom yum soup was yummmyyWe also got the TOSS beef salad. I was kinda dejected because I saw a picture of it on the yelp page and it looked really good, like a steak salad. But when it came out, it was more like a vietnamese lemongrass beef salad instead. I really wanted to try their croquette and samosas but when I got there, they didn't have it on their menu! I was kinda disappointed.Anyways it was self serve after they bring you your food. They had cute mason jars for you to fill up at the water station and a bucket to put your dirty bowls. I only noticed this after but if you look at the TOSS symbol, you can notice that the T and O make a wok and the S S are noodles! This is a cheap and easy meal. Parking sucks because it's so crowded and in downtown"
321,"A decent place to grab a quick dinner downtown, and cheaper than most places downtown.It's a build you own noodle/rice bowl, where you select you noodle/rice type, protein, and sauce. I really like the hokkien and spinach noodles (they maintain a good chew), usually with chicken and the Chinese or Japanese sauce. The portions are ok, you don't get a lot of the protein for what you pay, but it's tasty and again, it's much cheaper than most other places downtown. I've also tried their curry, which is alright- I'd still probably go somewhere that's just Thai food like Racha or Thai noodle for curry, but the curry here isn't bad. The restaurant itself is pretty cute, with a good range of tables for small to large groups (you order then seat yourself). One weird thing about it is that there's always flies hovering around the door? Nothing major and they're not inside the restaurant but it isn't the most pleasant experience walking into the restaurant."
322,"This place is an upscale fast food restaurant basically. The service is quick but the food is just alright. Definitely can be a quick fix for comfort food for those Asian college students who miss their parents cooking. You basically have control of what you put in your bowl. There are three options: rice, noodles, or fried rice. From there, you then choose your sauces, veggies, and/or meat. I got the soup with glass noodle, Tom Yum base, and beef. Tasted okay. The soup wasn't as strong like other Thai places and I would have also been okay with not finishing my meal. After you order, it's mostly self service. There's water on the side of the restaurant with cute Mason jars. However this establishment is quite small so I would not recommend large parties."
323,"Noodles for everyone! Toss is a great place to go when you can't decide what type of asian flavor, you particularly want. It's great for a group of people who just can't decide on one type of asian food. Hidden next to UA Berkeley Theaters, Toss is a casual asian fusion restaurant where you are able to combine different noodles, sauces, and meats. I've been to this place throughout my years at Berkeley and it never fails to satisfy my hunger for asian noodles. I usually get the hokkien noodles, which is a thick yellow egg noodles that absorbs the sauce you choose. I've tried most of the sauces but the best one would have to be the Malay peanut sauce. It adds a hearty peanut flavor to the noodles that I haven't seen anywhere else. If you aren't in the mood for any of the sauces the Laska, which is a curry coconut soup is perfect for a cold day. Make sure to ask for spicy or add your own spices, since it usually comes out bland without it. There is also rice dishes, but they never seem to be worth getting. The only complaint I have is that the sauces lack a depth of flavors like restaurants that focus on only one or two noodle dishes. However, for only $10 dollars, Toss has good portions sizes that is good for lunch and dinner!"
324,"Affordable, good place by campus for food. Choose your own noodles, sauce, veggies, meat, etc and they'll make it for you. Portion sizes are good, but nothing's amazing since you have the risk of putting not so great things together. Protip: get what you think you'll like."
325,This is your quick fast casual for noodles. You get to choose the type of noodles sauce and protein I got the hokkien noodles with Thai and Malay with chicken. It came out super quickly and each dish comes in a big bowl. It also comes with a bunch of different vegetables in the dish. It tasted slightly sweet but a little spicy but not too much. I wanted to get extra chili to spice it up! The noodles were stir fry quickly and I can see the wok hey markings on the noodles. It's around $10/$11 for each so it's a quick bite to eat. Just walk in and go directly to the counter. The waiter will give you a number and bring the food to you. Parking is rough in the area. I usually park near YMCA or the park a couple blocks away and walk here. Grab some noodles and walk it off in downtown Berkeley!
326,"Toss Noddle Bar is probably my favorite noodle place in all of Berkeley, and I don't know why I didn't go here since freshman year. TO be honest, I don't even remember what I ordered since I came a while back ago, but all I can tell you is that there isn't anything that can go wrong.Think of it as a subway, for noodles. haha, it's so customizable, and they even let you combine spaces which was pretty neat! This place isn't really great for large groups, which can be a downfall, but groups of 4 are perfect."
327,"I found this little gem while browsing in the search section on Yelp and have been coming back ever since.It is soooooo freaking good OMG. It's a design your own but they do have pre-set items that go in it. For instance, it comes with noodles but you get to pick which style you want. I always get hokkien noodles. They are thick like chow mein for those that are unfamiliar with the names. It comes with meat but you get to choose which one or two you want. Typically I get chicken but I have tried the combo and got chicken and prawn. The prawn wasn't cooked all the way : ( you pick your sauce of choice, I always get the Thai sauce. It's spicey. All noodle options come with veggies.For less than $10 and very filling. Yes! You can't beat that. I gave 4 stars just for the half cooked prawn. It happened both times I ordered the combo so I cannot even say it was an accident the first time. If I had known the shrimp would still be see through i wouldn't have ordered the combo. I ordered it a second time thinking maybe the first time it was an accident, so I tried again. Whomp, same issue. Some people may like it like that, but nah, if I wanted a shrimp cocktail I went somewhere that had that on the menu."
328,"The prices are reasonable and the food is tasty but the place is a little dirty and there are usually some flies around the restaurant. Water is self serve and you're supposed to bring your dishes to the their dish tray when you're done.I ordered the hokkaido noodles with Thai sauce and beef and the portions were fairly large. Overall, it is a pretty good place for a quick and tasty bite that won't break the bank."
329,"Alongside the busy strip of Shattuck Avenue lies a somewhat hidden Toss Noodle Bar where one can customize their noodles to their liking.I've tried this place a couple times now and I find the concept to be quite interesting. All in all, it's similar to Pieology and Chipotle, but for noodles. Choose your meats, sauce, type of noodles, and etc. based on your own preferences and they'll make it for you. I've tried various combinations and for the price, I did enjoy what I got though I found that no matter what I chose the enjoyment per bite depreciated very quickly. I feel that Toss is special in it's wide variety of possible combinations, but in that variety, there is a lack of specialization and passion for the food it serves due to it's concept of personal customization. Overall, I would say it's a fun experience to try, but for a good noodle dish, I would prefer a location where the chef understands the flavors and combinations that work to make a fulfilling mix of flavors with personality."
330,"Our family got caught in the pouring rain but thank goodness for Toss Noodle Bar!This eatery serves up noodle dishes, soups and rice bowls in a casual setting. Order up at the counter, pay and grab your own utensils and water. You clean up after yourself too! Why am I a fan of these places? because they keep the costs low. Most dishes are $10 or less!Whether easy or picky eaters, everyone has the freedom to choose whatever combo they want. You choose your base (noodle or rice), add your sauce (laksa, peanut sauce, hoisin, etc) add your meat. Then you can say if you just want it plain stir fry or in a soup. You can get your pho fix here too!I wasn't absurdly hungry so I ordered a bunch of appetizers for myself and for the table: chicken satay ($6), fried croquettes ($5), tofu salad ($4) coconut shrimp ($6).  Everything was cooked just right and had delicious accompanying sauces. Yum.Thanks Toss for keeping our family lunch affordable and fun! There was definitely a choice for everyone."
331,"When I first walked through the doors of Toss, there was a strange odor, almost like wet dog smell. I knew I wasn't alone, because the person I was with, who also happened to be the one who suggested Toss to me, also smelled it.

351,"When I first walked through the doors of Toss, there was a strange odor, almost like wet dog smell. I knew I wasn't alone, because the person I was with, who also happened to be the one who suggested Toss to me, also smelled it. The smell did not last long, it's just not what I was expecting from a restaurant. The menu is very simple. You pick what type of noodles you want (rice also available), then you choose the sauce you want it tossed in, and finally you choose your meat option. I went with wheat noodles, Thai sauce, and chicken. The food came out very quick. The wheat noodles are skinny noodles, which I prefer because it's easier to eat, in my opinion. I love the fresh veggies they use, and the Thai sauce was awesome. We also shared a plate of garlic edamame. The garlic were nice sized pieces, and fresh. The edamame is tossed in soy sauce, which adds another welcome flavor element. The restaurant has a nice, chill vibe to it. They havr a water station, where you can pour your own water, and the water itself is spa water (cucumber slices in it). In the end, they serve great food at a great price."
352,"We were looking for soup on a Thursday night. We couldn't believe how difficult it was to find soup or even a restaurant that's open past 8:30 pm.  This place was perfect. We created a bowl of soup - hokkien noodles, clear soup, and chicken. The waitress brought it to our table; nice and hot with good flavor.  Everything we saw being delivered to customers looked good. There's so many choices in designing your own meal. Stop in and try one; you won't be disappointed."
353,"I really do enjoy the noodles at this restaurant but I'm giving this review only 2 stars because the portion sizes at Toss is very disappointing. I started coming here a couple of years ago and every single time I come, the amount of noodles that actually go into my bowl heavily decreases. Noodles are pretty cheap, I could literally buy 3 noodle plates in Chinatown for less than $15. BUT I'm paying around $10-$13 at Toss for a bowl of noodles that barely reach the middle of my bowl. The last and final time I came here, I ordered the hokkien noodles with Thai sauce and beef, when the lady brought out my noodles, I could literally see the bottom of the bowl... THATS HOW LITTLE NOODLES I GOT! Are you serious Toss? I'm not blind. I had to go up to the cashier and let her know how disappointed I was before a new bowl was brought out to me. Overall, the noodles here are good, but since it seems like a ten dollar bill gets me less than half a bowl of noodles, I'll go spend my money at Imm Thai instead."
354,"I've come here a few times and now and ordered something different each time and have yet to be disappointed! You choose your base first: noodle, rice, or fried rice. There are 5 types of noodles and the option for white or brown rice. Then you pick the flavour you want. There are 5 different stir fry flavours as well as the option to get curry! Finally you pick a protein - tofu is the only vegetarian option and there's also plenty of meat options.I've had curry, fried rice, and noodles and they've all been great! Portion size is good and all the dishes come with plenty of veggies and egg as well. The tofu has also always been well cooked unlike some places where I've experienced semi raw chunks of tofu thrown in. Overall, I love the variety and consistency of their food and I can't wait to try more combos in the future!"
355,"Won't stop until I've tried every single noodle/rice/sauce/meat combination!Toss is seriously SOOOOO bae!  It's a fun process or ordering because you get to pick your own noodles or rice, sauce and meat.  You make exactly what you want to eat and it's all very good quality!There's not much of a customer service aspect here because you order at the counter and then just wait for your food to be brought to you at the table.  I like that there are big pitchers of water for customers though so we can keep one at the table.  I can't stand not having enough beverage with my meal!Toss has the traditional thai restaurant sauces with the chili, jalepenos, etc. but they have one that's a smooth consistency and spicy and it is HEAVEN!!!  If you like spice, DEFINITELY use this to spice up your dishPros: you get to order exactly what you want every time.  There are so many combinations of orders to get here and they're all equally good.cons: people who haven't been tend to order as if they've never heard of food before and might take a while if they're not used to the ordering process here, so beware.  TIP! if you order curry with noodles, I like to ask them to put them together so I don't have to mix in the noodles with the sauce myself.  It lets the noodles absorb more curry sauce.  It's SO good!Toss is definitely a fun place to come with friends for a fun dinner with delicious food and great atmosphere!  The staff is friendly and they make DELICIOUS food that will always leave you wanting to come back again!"
356,"Thai-Hokkien-beef YASS! My go-to noodle bar whenever I'm back in NorCal! You honestly can't go wrong with any combo here. Everything is delicious --even the Tom yum is up to par with my standards. Coconut prawns were also pretty tasty, but nothing to get super hyped about"
357,"Filling noodle dishes for good prices. Toss Noodle Bar made the order process simple: choose one of four different noodles, your meat/tofu, and your sauce. I personally liked the Hokkein noodles with shrimp and peanut sauce. Was quite delicious! Although the restaurant was packed the food came out quick. You gotta clean up after yourself but I'm happily doing so as the noodles were great and the prices aiiiiiright!"
358,"I've come several times in the past and ended up staring at a bunch of flies zooming around the restaurant entrance.  Pretty unappetizing for me...For some reason, a lot of my friends want to come here for dinner so I've been way more times than I would've chosen to.   You can choose your noodles/rice, protein, and sauce (or make it a soup).  The meal comes out to around $10, which is pretty decent.  My favorite combo has to be the the Hokkien noodle with chicken and peanut sauce.  Don't get me wrong.  The food is good.  I just don't really get the hype.  There's generally always a place for you to sit after ordering at the register.  There's cute mason jars for your water needs."
359,"I  usually am a man with the determination to finish any meal I get at restaurants, but when it comes to Toss Noodle Bar's bowls, they are so generous that I can't finish them; however, it's great because that means I can get some of that deliciousness for leftovers. Truly large portions with delicious soups like their sour and spicy tomyum.Honestly, do not come here for anything but the noodles. The curry or stir fry portions are not so filling and they cost as much as the soups because they charge based on the meat, so go for the bowls!Biggest plus is that they do not kick you out for bringing in outside drinks for example. Come here a lot with friends out of random bursts of cravings and I've come in with coffee or boba and they do not have a problem with that, which is great!"
360,"I love them nooDZ NOODZ nOODZ, noodz i do adooreeseriously this place is amazeballs. I love that you can customize your entire order. I was so excited coming in here because I saw the different variations you can do, as well as the other yummy appetizers they had on the menu! I got the spinach noodles with half malay(peanut) and half thai(spicy) with chicken as my protein. I like that the stir fry option already comes with lots of vegetables and egg. The two sauces combined gave it a nice creamy texture. The thai spicy sauce wasnt spicy at all! The noodles were cooked perfectlyThe bf got the thin rice tom yum soup with chicken. I didnt get to try a lot of it, but the soup was tom yum soup was yummmyyWe also got the TOSS beef salad. I was kinda dejected because I saw a picture of it on the yelp page and it looked really good, like a steak salad. But when it came out, it was more like a vietnamese lemongrass beef salad instead. I really wanted to try their croquette and samosas but when I got there, they didn't have it on their menu! I was kinda disappointed.Anyways it was self serve after they bring you your food. They had cute mason jars for you to fill up at the water station and a bucket to put your dirty bowls. I only noticed this after but if you look at the TOSS symbol, you can notice that the T and O make a wok and the S S are noodles! This is a cheap and easy meal. Parking sucks because it's so crowded and in downtown"
361,"A decent place to grab a quick dinner downtown, and cheaper than most places downtown.It's a build you own noodle/rice bowl, where you select you noodle/rice type, protein, and sauce. I really like the hokkien and spinach noodles (they maintain a good chew), usually with chicken and the Chinese or Japanese sauce. The portions are ok, you don't get a lot of the protein for what you pay, but it's tasty and again, it's much cheaper than most other places downtown. I've also tried their curry, which is alright- I'd still probably go somewhere that's just Thai food like Racha or Thai noodle for curry, but the curry here isn't bad. The restaurant itself is pretty cute, with a good range of tables for small to large groups (you order then seat yourself). One weird thing about it is that there's always flies hovering around the door? Nothing major and they're not inside the restaurant but it isn't the most pleasant experience walking into the restaurant."
362,"This place is an upscale fast food restaurant basically. The service is quick but the food is just alright. Definitely can be a quick fix for comfort food for those Asian college students who miss their parents cooking. You basically have control of what you put in your bowl. There are three options: rice, noodles, or fried rice. From there, you then choose your sauces, veggies, and/or meat. I got the soup with glass noodle, Tom Yum base, and beef. Tasted okay. The soup wasn't as strong like other Thai places and I would have also been okay with not finishing my meal. After you order, it's mostly self service. There's water on the side of the restaurant with cute Mason jars. However this establishment is quite small so I would not recommend large parties."
363,"Noodles for everyone! Toss is a great place to go when you can't decide what type of asian flavor, you particularly want. It's great for a group of people who just can't decide on one type of asian food. Hidden next to UA Berkeley Theaters, Toss is a casual asian fusion restaurant where you are able to combine different noodles, sauces, and meats. I've been to this place throughout my years at Berkeley and it never fails to satisfy my hunger for asian noodles. I usually get the hokkien noodles, which is a thick yellow egg noodles that absorbs the sauce you choose. I've tried most of the sauces but the best one would have to be the Malay peanut sauce. It adds a hearty peanut flavor to the noodles that I haven't seen anywhere else. If you aren't in the mood for any of the sauces the Laska, which is a curry coconut soup is perfect for a cold day. Make sure to ask for spicy or add your own spices, since it usually comes out bland without it. There is also rice dishes, but they never seem to be worth getting. The only complaint I have is that the sauces lack a depth of flavors like restaurants that focus on only one or two noodle dishes. However, for only $10 dollars, Toss has good portions sizes that is good for lunch and dinner!"
364,"Affordable, good place by campus for food. Choose your own noodles, sauce, veggies, meat, etc and they'll make it for you. Portion sizes are good, but nothing's amazing since you have the risk of putting not so great things together. Protip: get what you think you'll like."
365,This is your quick fast casual for noodles. You get to choose the type of noodles sauce and protein I got the hokkien noodles with Thai and Malay with chicken. It came out super quickly and each dish comes in a big bowl. It also comes with a bunch of different vegetables in the dish. It tasted slightly sweet but a little spicy but not too much. I wanted to get extra chili to spice it up! The noodles were stir fry quickly and I can see the wok hey markings on the noodles. It's around $10/$11 for each so it's a quick bite to eat. Just walk in and go directly to the counter. The waiter will give you a number and bring the food to you. Parking is rough in the area. I usually park near YMCA or the park a couple blocks away and walk here. Grab some noodles and walk it off in downtown Berkeley!
366,"Toss Noddle Bar is probably my favorite noodle place in all of Berkeley, and I don't know why I didn't go here since freshman year. TO be honest, I don't even remember what I ordered since I came a while back ago, but all I can tell you is that there isn't anything that can go wrong.Think of it as a subway, for noodles. haha, it's so customizable, and they even let you combine spaces which was pretty neat! This place isn't really great for large groups, which can be a downfall, but groups of 4 are perfect."
367,"I found this little gem while browsing in the search section on Yelp and have been coming back ever since.It is soooooo freaking good OMG. It's a design your own but they do have pre-set items that go in it. For instance, it comes with noodles but you get to pick which style you want. I always get hokkien noodles. They are thick like chow mein for those that are unfamiliar with the names. It comes with meat but you get to choose which one or two you want. Typically I get chicken but I have tried the combo and got chicken and prawn. The prawn wasn't cooked all the way : ( you pick your sauce of choice, I always get the Thai sauce. It's spicey. All noodle options come with veggies.For less than $10 and very filling. Yes! You can't beat that. I gave 4 stars just for the half cooked prawn. It happened both times I ordered the combo so I cannot even say it was an accident the first time. If I had known the shrimp would still be see through i wouldn't have ordered the combo. I ordered it a second time thinking maybe the first time it was an accident, so I tried again. Whomp, same issue. Some people may like it like that, but nah, if I wanted a shrimp cocktail I went somewhere that had that on the menu."
368,"The prices are reasonable and the food is tasty but the place is a little dirty and there are usually some flies around the restaurant. Water is self serve and you're supposed to bring your dishes to the their dish tray when you're done.I ordered the hokkaido noodles with Thai sauce and beef and the portions were fairly large. Overall, it is a pretty good place for a quick and tasty bite that won't break the bank."
369,"Alongside the busy strip of Shattuck Avenue lies a somewhat hidden Toss Noodle Bar where one can customize their noodles to their liking.I've tried this place a couple times now and I find the concept to be quite interesting. All in all, it's similar to Pieology and Chipotle, but for noodles. Choose your meats, sauce, type of noodles, and etc. based on your own preferences and they'll make it for you. I've tried various combinations and for the price, I did enjoy what I got though I found that no matter what I chose the enjoyment per bite depreciated very quickly. I feel that Toss is special in it's wide variety of possible combinations, but in that variety, there is a lack of specialization and passion for the food it serves due to it's concept of personal customization. Overall, I would say it's a fun experience to try, but for a good noodle dish, I would prefer a location where the chef understands the flavors and combinations that work to make a fulfilling mix of flavors with personality."
370,"Our family got caught in the pouring rain but thank goodness for Toss Noodle Bar!This eatery serves up noodle dishes, soups and rice bowls in a casual setting. Order up at the counter, pay and grab your own utensils and water. You clean up after yourself too! Why am I a fan of these places? because they keep the costs low. Most dishes are $10 or less!Whether easy or picky eaters, everyone has the freedom to choose whatever combo they want. You choose your base (noodle or rice), add your sauce (laksa, peanut sauce, hoisin, etc) add your meat. Then you can say if you just want it plain stir fry or in a soup. You can get your pho fix here too!I wasn't absurdly hungry so I ordered a bunch of appetizers for myself and for the table: chicken satay ($6), fried croquettes ($5), tofu salad ($4) coconut shrimp ($6).  Everything was cooked just right and had delicious accompanying sauces.

Most dishes are $10 or less!Whether easy or picky eaters, everyone has the freedom to choose whatever combo they want. You choose your base (noodle or rice), add your sauce (laksa, peanut sauce, hoisin, etc) add your meat. Then you can say if you just want it plain stir fry or in a soup. You can get your pho fix here too!I wasn't absurdly hungry so I ordered a bunch of appetizers for myself and for the table: chicken satay ($6), fried croquettes ($5), tofu salad ($4) coconut shrimp ($6).  Everything was cooked just right and had delicious accompanying sauces. Yum.Thanks Toss for keeping our family lunch affordable and fun! There was definitely a choice for everyone."
391,"When I first walked through the doors of Toss, there was a strange odor, almost like wet dog smell. I knew I wasn't alone, because the person I was with, who also happened to be the one who suggested Toss to me, also smelled it. The smell did not last long, it's just not what I was expecting from a restaurant. The menu is very simple. You pick what type of noodles you want (rice also available), then you choose the sauce you want it tossed in, and finally you choose your meat option. I went with wheat noodles, Thai sauce, and chicken. The food came out very quick. The wheat noodles are skinny noodles, which I prefer because it's easier to eat, in my opinion. I love the fresh veggies they use, and the Thai sauce was awesome. We also shared a plate of garlic edamame. The garlic were nice sized pieces, and fresh. The edamame is tossed in soy sauce, which adds another welcome flavor element. The restaurant has a nice, chill vibe to it. They havr a water station, where you can pour your own water, and the water itself is spa water (cucumber slices in it). In the end, they serve great food at a great price."
392,"We were looking for soup on a Thursday night. We couldn't believe how difficult it was to find soup or even a restaurant that's open past 8:30 pm.  This place was perfect. We created a bowl of soup - hokkien noodles, clear soup, and chicken. The waitress brought it to our table; nice and hot with good flavor.  Everything we saw being delivered to customers looked good. There's so many choices in designing your own meal. Stop in and try one; you won't be disappointed."
393,"I really do enjoy the noodles at this restaurant but I'm giving this review only 2 stars because the portion sizes at Toss is very disappointing. I started coming here a couple of years ago and every single time I come, the amount of noodles that actually go into my bowl heavily decreases. Noodles are pretty cheap, I could literally buy 3 noodle plates in Chinatown for less than $15. BUT I'm paying around $10-$13 at Toss for a bowl of noodles that barely reach the middle of my bowl. The last and final time I came here, I ordered the hokkien noodles with Thai sauce and beef, when the lady brought out my noodles, I could literally see the bottom of the bowl... THATS HOW LITTLE NOODLES I GOT! Are you serious Toss? I'm not blind. I had to go up to the cashier and let her know how disappointed I was before a new bowl was brought out to me. Overall, the noodles here are good, but since it seems like a ten dollar bill gets me less than half a bowl of noodles, I'll go spend my money at Imm Thai instead."
394,"I've come here a few times and now and ordered something different each time and have yet to be disappointed! You choose your base first: noodle, rice, or fried rice. There are 5 types of noodles and the option for white or brown rice. Then you pick the flavour you want. There are 5 different stir fry flavours as well as the option to get curry! Finally you pick a protein - tofu is the only vegetarian option and there's also plenty of meat options.I've had curry, fried rice, and noodles and they've all been great! Portion size is good and all the dishes come with plenty of veggies and egg as well. The tofu has also always been well cooked unlike some places where I've experienced semi raw chunks of tofu thrown in. Overall, I love the variety and consistency of their food and I can't wait to try more combos in the future!"
395,"Won't stop until I've tried every single noodle/rice/sauce/meat combination!Toss is seriously SOOOOO bae!  It's a fun process or ordering because you get to pick your own noodles or rice, sauce and meat.  You make exactly what you want to eat and it's all very good quality!There's not much of a customer service aspect here because you order at the counter and then just wait for your food to be brought to you at the table.  I like that there are big pitchers of water for customers though so we can keep one at the table.  I can't stand not having enough beverage with my meal!Toss has the traditional thai restaurant sauces with the chili, jalepenos, etc. but they have one that's a smooth consistency and spicy and it is HEAVEN!!!  If you like spice, DEFINITELY use this to spice up your dishPros: you get to order exactly what you want every time.  There are so many combinations of orders to get here and they're all equally good.cons: people who haven't been tend to order as if they've never heard of food before and might take a while if they're not used to the ordering process here, so beware.  TIP! if you order curry with noodles, I like to ask them to put them together so I don't have to mix in the noodles with the sauce myself.  It lets the noodles absorb more curry sauce.  It's SO good!Toss is definitely a fun place to come with friends for a fun dinner with delicious food and great atmosphere!  The staff is friendly and they make DELICIOUS food that will always leave you wanting to come back again!"
396,"Thai-Hokkien-beef YASS! My go-to noodle bar whenever I'm back in NorCal! You honestly can't go wrong with any combo here. Everything is delicious --even the Tom yum is up to par with my standards. Coconut prawns were also pretty tasty, but nothing to get super hyped about"
397,"Filling noodle dishes for good prices. Toss Noodle Bar made the order process simple: choose one of four different noodles, your meat/tofu, and your sauce. I personally liked the Hokkein noodles with shrimp and peanut sauce. Was quite delicious! Although the restaurant was packed the food came out quick. You gotta clean up after yourself but I'm happily doing so as the noodles were great and the prices aiiiiiright!"
398,"I've come several times in the past and ended up staring at a bunch of flies zooming around the restaurant entrance.  Pretty unappetizing for me...For some reason, a lot of my friends want to come here for dinner so I've been way more times than I would've chosen to.   You can choose your noodles/rice, protein, and sauce (or make it a soup).  The meal comes out to around $10, which is pretty decent.  My favorite combo has to be the the Hokkien noodle with chicken and peanut sauce.  Don't get me wrong.  The food is good.  I just don't really get the hype.  There's generally always a place for you to sit after ordering at the register.  There's cute mason jars for your water needs."
399,"I  usually am a man with the determination to finish any meal I get at restaurants, but when it comes to Toss Noodle Bar's bowls, they are so generous that I can't finish them; however, it's great because that means I can get some of that deliciousness for leftovers. Truly large portions with delicious soups like their sour and spicy tomyum.Honestly, do not come here for anything but the noodles. The curry or stir fry portions are not so filling and they cost as much as the soups because they charge based on the meat, so go for the bowls!Biggest plus is that they do not kick you out for bringing in outside drinks for example. Come here a lot with friends out of random bursts of cravings and I've come in with coffee or boba and they do not have a problem with that, which is great!"
400,"I love them nooDZ NOODZ nOODZ, noodz i do adooreeseriously this place is amazeballs. I love that you can customize your entire order. I was so excited coming in here because I saw the different variations you can do, as well as the other yummy appetizers they had on the menu! I got the spinach noodles with half malay(peanut) and half thai(spicy) with chicken as my protein. I like that the stir fry option already comes with lots of vegetables and egg. The two sauces combined gave it a nice creamy texture. The thai spicy sauce wasnt spicy at all! The noodles were cooked perfectlyThe bf got the thin rice tom yum soup with chicken. I didnt get to try a lot of it, but the soup was tom yum soup was yummmyyWe also got the TOSS beef salad. I was kinda dejected because I saw a picture of it on the yelp page and it looked really good, like a steak salad. But when it came out, it was more like a vietnamese lemongrass beef salad instead. I really wanted to try their croquette and samosas but when I got there, they didn't have it on their menu! I was kinda disappointed.Anyways it was self serve after they bring you your food. They had cute mason jars for you to fill up at the water station and a bucket to put your dirty bowls. I only noticed this after but if you look at the TOSS symbol, you can notice that the T and O make a wok and the S S are noodles! This is a cheap and easy meal. Parking sucks because it's so crowded and in downtown"
401,"A decent place to grab a quick dinner downtown, and cheaper than most places downtown.It's a build you own noodle/rice bowl, where you select you noodle/rice type, protein, and sauce. I really like the hokkien and spinach noodles (they maintain a good chew), usually with chicken and the Chinese or Japanese sauce. The portions are ok, you don't get a lot of the protein for what you pay, but it's tasty and again, it's much cheaper than most other places downtown. I've also tried their curry, which is alright- I'd still probably go somewhere that's just Thai food like Racha or Thai noodle for curry, but the curry here isn't bad. The restaurant itself is pretty cute, with a good range of tables for small to large groups (you order then seat yourself). One weird thing about it is that there's always flies hovering around the door? Nothing major and they're not inside the restaurant but it isn't the most pleasant experience walking into the restaurant."
402,"This place is an upscale fast food restaurant basically. The service is quick but the food is just alright. Definitely can be a quick fix for comfort food for those Asian college students who miss their parents cooking. You basically have control of what you put in your bowl. There are three options: rice, noodles, or fried rice. From there, you then choose your sauces, veggies, and/or meat. I got the soup with glass noodle, Tom Yum base, and beef. Tasted okay. The soup wasn't as strong like other Thai places and I would have also been okay with not finishing my meal. After you order, it's mostly self service. There's water on the side of the restaurant with cute Mason jars. However this establishment is quite small so I would not recommend large parties."
403,"Noodles for everyone! Toss is a great place to go when you can't decide what type of asian flavor, you particularly want. It's great for a group of people who just can't decide on one type of asian food. Hidden next to UA Berkeley Theaters, Toss is a casual asian fusion restaurant where you are able to combine different noodles, sauces, and meats. I've been to this place throughout my years at Berkeley and it never fails to satisfy my hunger for asian noodles. I usually get the hokkien noodles, which is a thick yellow egg noodles that absorbs the sauce you choose. I've tried most of the sauces but the best one would have to be the Malay peanut sauce. It adds a hearty peanut flavor to the noodles that I haven't seen anywhere else. If you aren't in the mood for any of the sauces the Laska, which is a curry coconut soup is perfect for a cold day. Make sure to ask for spicy or add your own spices, since it usually comes out bland without it. There is also rice dishes, but they never seem to be worth getting. The only complaint I have is that the sauces lack a depth of flavors like restaurants that focus on only one or two noodle dishes. However, for only $10 dollars, Toss has good portions sizes that is good for lunch and dinner!"
404,"Affordable, good place by campus for food. Choose your own noodles, sauce, veggies, meat, etc and they'll make it for you. Portion sizes are good, but nothing's amazing since you have the risk of putting not so great things together. Protip: get what you think you'll like."
405,This is your quick fast casual for noodles. You get to choose the type of noodles sauce and protein I got the hokkien noodles with Thai and Malay with chicken. It came out super quickly and each dish comes in a big bowl. It also comes with a bunch of different vegetables in the dish. It tasted slightly sweet but a little spicy but not too much. I wanted to get extra chili to spice it up! The noodles were stir fry quickly and I can see the wok hey markings on the noodles. It's around $10/$11 for each so it's a quick bite to eat. Just walk in and go directly to the counter. The waiter will give you a number and bring the food to you. Parking is rough in the area. I usually park near YMCA or the park a couple blocks away and walk here. Grab some noodles and walk it off in downtown Berkeley!
406,"Toss Noddle Bar is probably my favorite noodle place in all of Berkeley, and I don't know why I didn't go here since freshman year. TO be honest, I don't even remember what I ordered since I came a while back ago, but all I can tell you is that there isn't anything that can go wrong.Think of it as a subway, for noodles. haha, it's so customizable, and they even let you combine spaces which was pretty neat! This place isn't really great for large groups, which can be a downfall, but groups of 4 are perfect."
407,"I found this little gem while browsing in the search section on Yelp and have been coming back ever since.It is soooooo freaking good OMG. It's a design your own but they do have pre-set items that go in it. For instance, it comes with noodles but you get to pick which style you want. I always get hokkien noodles. They are thick like chow mein for those that are unfamiliar with the names. It comes with meat but you get to choose which one or two you want. Typically I get chicken but I have tried the combo and got chicken and prawn. The prawn wasn't cooked all the way : ( you pick your sauce of choice, I always get the Thai sauce. It's spicey. All noodle options come with veggies.For less than $10 and very filling. Yes! You can't beat that. I gave 4 stars just for the half cooked prawn. It happened both times I ordered the combo so I cannot even say it was an accident the first time. If I had known the shrimp would still be see through i wouldn't have ordered the combo. I ordered it a second time thinking maybe the first time it was an accident, so I tried again. Whomp, same issue. Some people may like it like that, but nah, if I wanted a shrimp cocktail I went somewhere that had that on the menu."
408,"The prices are reasonable and the food is tasty but the place is a little dirty and there are usually some flies around the restaurant. Water is self serve and you're supposed to bring your dishes to the their dish tray when you're done.I ordered the hokkaido noodles with Thai sauce and beef and the portions were fairly large. Overall, it is a pretty good place for a quick and tasty bite that won't break the bank."
409,"Alongside the busy strip of Shattuck Avenue lies a somewhat hidden Toss Noodle Bar where one can customize their noodles to their liking.I've tried this place a couple times now and I find the concept to be quite interesting. All in all, it's similar to Pieology and Chipotle, but for noodles. Choose your meats, sauce, type of noodles, and etc. based on your own preferences and they'll make it for you. I've tried various combinations and for the price, I did enjoy what I got though I found that no matter what I chose the enjoyment per bite depreciated very quickly. I feel that Toss is special in it's wide variety of possible combinations, but in that variety, there is a lack of specialization and passion for the food it serves due to it's concept of personal customization. Overall, I would say it's a fun experience to try, but for a good noodle dish, I would prefer a location where the chef understands the flavors and combinations that work to make a fulfilling mix of flavors with personality."

I feel that Toss is special in it's wide variety of possible combinations, but in that variety, there is a lack of specialization and passion for the food it serves due to it's concept of personal customization. Overall, I would say it's a fun experience to try, but for a good noodle dish, I would prefer a location where the chef understands the flavors and combinations that work to make a fulfilling mix of flavors with personality."
430,"Our family got caught in the pouring rain but thank goodness for Toss Noodle Bar!This eatery serves up noodle dishes, soups and rice bowls in a casual setting. Order up at the counter, pay and grab your own utensils and water. You clean up after yourself too! Why am I a fan of these places? because they keep the costs low. Most dishes are $10 or less!Whether easy or picky eaters, everyone has the freedom to choose whatever combo they want. You choose your base (noodle or rice), add your sauce (laksa, peanut sauce, hoisin, etc) add your meat. Then you can say if you just want it plain stir fry or in a soup. You can get your pho fix here too!I wasn't absurdly hungry so I ordered a bunch of appetizers for myself and for the table: chicken satay ($6), fried croquettes ($5), tofu salad ($4) coconut shrimp ($6).  Everything was cooked just right and had delicious accompanying sauces. Yum.Thanks Toss for keeping our family lunch affordable and fun! There was definitely a choice for everyone."
431,"When I first walked through the doors of Toss, there was a strange odor, almost like wet dog smell. I knew I wasn't alone, because the person I was with, who also happened to be the one who suggested Toss to me, also smelled it. The smell did not last long, it's just not what I was expecting from a restaurant. The menu is very simple. You pick what type of noodles you want (rice also available), then you choose the sauce you want it tossed in, and finally you choose your meat option. I went with wheat noodles, Thai sauce, and chicken. The food came out very quick. The wheat noodles are skinny noodles, which I prefer because it's easier to eat, in my opinion. I love the fresh veggies they use, and the Thai sauce was awesome. We also shared a plate of garlic edamame. The garlic were nice sized pieces, and fresh. The edamame is tossed in soy sauce, which adds another welcome flavor element. The restaurant has a nice, chill vibe to it. They havr a water station, where you can pour your own water, and the water itself is spa water (cucumber slices in it). In the end, they serve great food at a great price."
432,"We were looking for soup on a Thursday night. We couldn't believe how difficult it was to find soup or even a restaurant that's open past 8:30 pm.  This place was perfect. We created a bowl of soup - hokkien noodles, clear soup, and chicken. The waitress brought it to our table; nice and hot with good flavor.  Everything we saw being delivered to customers looked good. There's so many choices in designing your own meal. Stop in and try one; you won't be disappointed."
433,"I really do enjoy the noodles at this restaurant but I'm giving this review only 2 stars because the portion sizes at Toss is very disappointing. I started coming here a couple of years ago and every single time I come, the amount of noodles that actually go into my bowl heavily decreases. Noodles are pretty cheap, I could literally buy 3 noodle plates in Chinatown for less than $15. BUT I'm paying around $10-$13 at Toss for a bowl of noodles that barely reach the middle of my bowl. The last and final time I came here, I ordered the hokkien noodles with Thai sauce and beef, when the lady brought out my noodles, I could literally see the bottom of the bowl... THATS HOW LITTLE NOODLES I GOT! Are you serious Toss? I'm not blind. I had to go up to the cashier and let her know how disappointed I was before a new bowl was brought out to me. Overall, the noodles here are good, but since it seems like a ten dollar bill gets me less than half a bowl of noodles, I'll go spend my money at Imm Thai instead."
434,"I've come here a few times and now and ordered something different each time and have yet to be disappointed! You choose your base first: noodle, rice, or fried rice. There are 5 types of noodles and the option for white or brown rice. Then you pick the flavour you want. There are 5 different stir fry flavours as well as the option to get curry! Finally you pick a protein - tofu is the only vegetarian option and there's also plenty of meat options.I've had curry, fried rice, and noodles and they've all been great! Portion size is good and all the dishes come with plenty of veggies and egg as well. The tofu has also always been well cooked unlike some places where I've experienced semi raw chunks of tofu thrown in. Overall, I love the variety and consistency of their food and I can't wait to try more combos in the future!"
435,"Won't stop until I've tried every single noodle/rice/sauce/meat combination!Toss is seriously SOOOOO bae!  It's a fun process or ordering because you get to pick your own noodles or rice, sauce and meat.  You make exactly what you want to eat and it's all very good quality!There's not much of a customer service aspect here because you order at the counter and then just wait for your food to be brought to you at the table.  I like that there are big pitchers of water for customers though so we can keep one at the table.  I can't stand not having enough beverage with my meal!Toss has the traditional thai restaurant sauces with the chili, jalepenos, etc. but they have one that's a smooth consistency and spicy and it is HEAVEN!!!  If you like spice, DEFINITELY use this to spice up your dishPros: you get to order exactly what you want every time.  There are so many combinations of orders to get here and they're all equally good.cons: people who haven't been tend to order as if they've never heard of food before and might take a while if they're not used to the ordering process here, so beware.  TIP! if you order curry with noodles, I like to ask them to put them together so I don't have to mix in the noodles with the sauce myself.  It lets the noodles absorb more curry sauce.  It's SO good!Toss is definitely a fun place to come with friends for a fun dinner with delicious food and great atmosphere!  The staff is friendly and they make DELICIOUS food that will always leave you wanting to come back again!"
436,"Thai-Hokkien-beef YASS! My go-to noodle bar whenever I'm back in NorCal! You honestly can't go wrong with any combo here. Everything is delicious --even the Tom yum is up to par with my standards. Coconut prawns were also pretty tasty, but nothing to get super hyped about"
437,"Filling noodle dishes for good prices. Toss Noodle Bar made the order process simple: choose one of four different noodles, your meat/tofu, and your sauce. I personally liked the Hokkein noodles with shrimp and peanut sauce. Was quite delicious! Although the restaurant was packed the food came out quick. You gotta clean up after yourself but I'm happily doing so as the noodles were great and the prices aiiiiiright!"
438,"I've come several times in the past and ended up staring at a bunch of flies zooming around the restaurant entrance.  Pretty unappetizing for me...For some reason, a lot of my friends want to come here for dinner so I've been way more times than I would've chosen to.   You can choose your noodles/rice, protein, and sauce (or make it a soup).  The meal comes out to around $10, which is pretty decent.  My favorite combo has to be the the Hokkien noodle with chicken and peanut sauce.  Don't get me wrong.  The food is good.  I just don't really get the hype.  There's generally always a place for you to sit after ordering at the register.  There's cute mason jars for your water needs."
439,"I  usually am a man with the determination to finish any meal I get at restaurants, but when it comes to Toss Noodle Bar's bowls, they are so generous that I can't finish them; however, it's great because that means I can get some of that deliciousness for leftovers. Truly large portions with delicious soups like their sour and spicy tomyum.Honestly, do not come here for anything but the noodles. The curry or stir fry portions are not so filling and they cost as much as the soups because they charge based on the meat, so go for the bowls!Biggest plus is that they do not kick you out for bringing in outside drinks for example. Come here a lot with friends out of random bursts of cravings and I've come in with coffee or boba and they do not have a problem with that, which is great!"
440,"I love them nooDZ NOODZ nOODZ, noodz i do adooreeseriously this place is amazeballs. I love that you can customize your entire order. I was so excited coming in here because I saw the different variations you can do, as well as the other yummy appetizers they had on the menu! I got the spinach noodles with half malay(peanut) and half thai(spicy) with chicken as my protein. I like that the stir fry option already comes with lots of vegetables and egg. The two sauces combined gave it a nice creamy texture. The thai spicy sauce wasnt spicy at all! The noodles were cooked perfectlyThe bf got the thin rice tom yum soup with chicken. I didnt get to try a lot of it, but the soup was tom yum soup was yummmyyWe also got the TOSS beef salad. I was kinda dejected because I saw a picture of it on the yelp page and it looked really good, like a steak salad. But when it came out, it was more like a vietnamese lemongrass beef salad instead. I really wanted to try their croquette and samosas but when I got there, they didn't have it on their menu! I was kinda disappointed.Anyways it was self serve after they bring you your food. They had cute mason jars for you to fill up at the water station and a bucket to put your dirty bowls. I only noticed this after but if you look at the TOSS symbol, you can notice that the T and O make a wok and the S S are noodles! This is a cheap and easy meal. Parking sucks because it's so crowded and in downtown"
441,"A decent place to grab a quick dinner downtown, and cheaper than most places downtown.It's a build you own noodle/rice bowl, where you select you noodle/rice type, protein, and sauce. I really like the hokkien and spinach noodles (they maintain a good chew), usually with chicken and the Chinese or Japanese sauce. The portions are ok, you don't get a lot of the protein for what you pay, but it's tasty and again, it's much cheaper than most other places downtown. I've also tried their curry, which is alright- I'd still probably go somewhere that's just Thai food like Racha or Thai noodle for curry, but the curry here isn't bad. The restaurant itself is pretty cute, with a good range of tables for small to large groups (you order then seat yourself). One weird thing about it is that there's always flies hovering around the door? Nothing major and they're not inside the restaurant but it isn't the most pleasant experience walking into the restaurant."
442,"This place is an upscale fast food restaurant basically. The service is quick but the food is just alright. Definitely can be a quick fix for comfort food for those Asian college students who miss their parents cooking. You basically have control of what you put in your bowl. There are three options: rice, noodles, or fried rice. From there, you then choose your sauces, veggies, and/or meat. I got the soup with glass noodle, Tom Yum base, and beef. Tasted okay. The soup wasn't as strong like other Thai places and I would have also been okay with not finishing my meal. After you order, it's mostly self service. There's water on the side of the restaurant with cute Mason jars. However this establishment is quite small so I would not recommend large parties."
443,"Noodles for everyone! Toss is a great place to go when you can't decide what type of asian flavor, you particularly want. It's great for a group of people who just can't decide on one type of asian food. Hidden next to UA Berkeley Theaters, Toss is a casual asian fusion restaurant where you are able to combine different noodles, sauces, and meats. I've been to this place throughout my years at Berkeley and it never fails to satisfy my hunger for asian noodles. I usually get the hokkien noodles, which is a thick yellow egg noodles that absorbs the sauce you choose. I've tried most of the sauces but the best one would have to be the Malay peanut sauce. It adds a hearty peanut flavor to the noodles that I haven't seen anywhere else. If you aren't in the mood for any of the sauces the Laska, which is a curry coconut soup is perfect for a cold day. Make sure to ask for spicy or add your own spices, since it usually comes out bland without it. There is also rice dishes, but they never seem to be worth getting. The only complaint I have is that the sauces lack a depth of flavors like restaurants that focus on only one or two noodle dishes. However, for only $10 dollars, Toss has good portions sizes that is good for lunch and dinner!"
444,"Affordable, good place by campus for food. Choose your own noodles, sauce, veggies, meat, etc and they'll make it for you. Portion sizes are good, but nothing's amazing since you have the risk of putting not so great things together. Protip: get what you think you'll like."
445,This is your quick fast casual for noodles. You get to choose the type of noodles sauce and protein I got the hokkien noodles with Thai and Malay with chicken. It came out super quickly and each dish comes in a big bowl. It also comes with a bunch of different vegetables in the dish. It tasted slightly sweet but a little spicy but not too much. I wanted to get extra chili to spice it up! The noodles were stir fry quickly and I can see the wok hey markings on the noodles. It's around $10/$11 for each so it's a quick bite to eat. Just walk in and go directly to the counter. The waiter will give you a number and bring the food to you. Parking is rough in the area. I usually park near YMCA or the park a couple blocks away and walk here. Grab some noodles and walk it off in downtown Berkeley!
446,"Toss Noddle Bar is probably my favorite noodle place in all of Berkeley, and I don't know why I didn't go here since freshman year. TO be honest, I don't even remember what I ordered since I came a while back ago, but all I can tell you is that there isn't anything that can go wrong.Think of it as a subway, for noodles. haha, it's so customizable, and they even let you combine spaces which was pretty neat! This place isn't really great for large groups, which can be a downfall, but groups of 4 are perfect."
447,"I found this little gem while browsing in the search section on Yelp and have been coming back ever since.It is soooooo freaking good OMG. It's a design your own but they do have pre-set items that go in it. For instance, it comes with noodles but you get to pick which style you want. I always get hokkien noodles. They are thick like chow mein for those that are unfamiliar with the names. It comes with meat but you get to choose which one or two you want. Typically I get chicken but I have tried the combo and got chicken and prawn. The prawn wasn't cooked all the way : ( you pick your sauce of choice, I always get the Thai sauce. It's spicey. All noodle options come with veggies.For less than $10 and very filling. Yes! You can't beat that. I gave 4 stars just for the half cooked prawn. It happened both times I ordered the combo so I cannot even say it was an accident the first time. If I had known the shrimp would still be see through i wouldn't have ordered the combo. I ordered it a second time thinking maybe the first time it was an accident, so I tried again. Whomp, same issue. Some people may like it like that, but nah, if I wanted a shrimp cocktail I went somewhere that had that on the menu."
448,"The prices are reasonable and the food is tasty but the place is a little dirty and there are usually some flies around the restaurant. Water is self serve and you're supposed to bring your dishes to the their dish tray when you're done.I ordered the hokkaido noodles with Thai sauce and beef and the portions were fairly large. Overall, it is a pretty good place for a quick and tasty bite that won't break the bank."
449,"Alongside the busy strip of Shattuck Avenue lies a somewhat hidden Toss Noodle Bar where one can customize their noodles to their liking.I've tried this place a couple times now and I find the concept to be quite interesting.

Overall, it is a pretty good place for a quick and tasty bite that won't break the bank."
469,"Alongside the busy strip of Shattuck Avenue lies a somewhat hidden Toss Noodle Bar where one can customize their noodles to their liking.I've tried this place a couple times now and I find the concept to be quite interesting. All in all, it's similar to Pieology and Chipotle, but for noodles. Choose your meats, sauce, type of noodles, and etc. based on your own preferences and they'll make it for you. I've tried various combinations and for the price, I did enjoy what I got though I found that no matter what I chose the enjoyment per bite depreciated very quickly. I feel that Toss is special in it's wide variety of possible combinations, but in that variety, there is a lack of specialization and passion for the food it serves due to it's concept of personal customization. Overall, I would say it's a fun experience to try, but for a good noodle dish, I would prefer a location where the chef understands the flavors and combinations that work to make a fulfilling mix of flavors with personality."
470,"Our family got caught in the pouring rain but thank goodness for Toss Noodle Bar!This eatery serves up noodle dishes, soups and rice bowls in a casual setting. Order up at the counter, pay and grab your own utensils and water. You clean up after yourself too! Why am I a fan of these places? because they keep the costs low. Most dishes are $10 or less!Whether easy or picky eaters, everyone has the freedom to choose whatever combo they want. You choose your base (noodle or rice), add your sauce (laksa, peanut sauce, hoisin, etc) add your meat. Then you can say if you just want it plain stir fry or in a soup. You can get your pho fix here too!I wasn't absurdly hungry so I ordered a bunch of appetizers for myself and for the table: chicken satay ($6), fried croquettes ($5), tofu salad ($4) coconut shrimp ($6).  Everything was cooked just right and had delicious accompanying sauces. Yum.Thanks Toss for keeping our family lunch affordable and fun! There was definitely a choice for everyone."
471,"When I first walked through the doors of Toss, there was a strange odor, almost like wet dog smell. I knew I wasn't alone, because the person I was with, who also happened to be the one who suggested Toss to me, also smelled it. The smell did not last long, it's just not what I was expecting from a restaurant. The menu is very simple. You pick what type of noodles you want (rice also available), then you choose the sauce you want it tossed in, and finally you choose your meat option. I went with wheat noodles, Thai sauce, and chicken. The food came out very quick. The wheat noodles are skinny noodles, which I prefer because it's easier to eat, in my opinion. I love the fresh veggies they use, and the Thai sauce was awesome. We also shared a plate of garlic edamame. The garlic were nice sized pieces, and fresh. The edamame is tossed in soy sauce, which adds another welcome flavor element. The restaurant has a nice, chill vibe to it. They havr a water station, where you can pour your own water, and the water itself is spa water (cucumber slices in it). In the end, they serve great food at a great price."
472,"We were looking for soup on a Thursday night. We couldn't believe how difficult it was to find soup or even a restaurant that's open past 8:30 pm.  This place was perfect. We created a bowl of soup - hokkien noodles, clear soup, and chicken. The waitress brought it to our table; nice and hot with good flavor.  Everything we saw being delivered to customers looked good. There's so many choices in designing your own meal. Stop in and try one; you won't be disappointed."
473,"I really do enjoy the noodles at this restaurant but I'm giving this review only 2 stars because the portion sizes at Toss is very disappointing. I started coming here a couple of years ago and every single time I come, the amount of noodles that actually go into my bowl heavily decreases. Noodles are pretty cheap, I could literally buy 3 noodle plates in Chinatown for less than $15. BUT I'm paying around $10-$13 at Toss for a bowl of noodles that barely reach the middle of my bowl. The last and final time I came here, I ordered the hokkien noodles with Thai sauce and beef, when the lady brought out my noodles, I could literally see the bottom of the bowl... THATS HOW LITTLE NOODLES I GOT! Are you serious Toss? I'm not blind. I had to go up to the cashier and let her know how disappointed I was before a new bowl was brought out to me. Overall, the noodles here are good, but since it seems like a ten dollar bill gets me less than half a bowl of noodles, I'll go spend my money at Imm Thai instead."
474,"I've come here a few times and now and ordered something different each time and have yet to be disappointed! You choose your base first: noodle, rice, or fried rice. There are 5 types of noodles and the option for white or brown rice. Then you pick the flavour you want. There are 5 different stir fry flavours as well as the option to get curry! Finally you pick a protein - tofu is the only vegetarian option and there's also plenty of meat options.I've had curry, fried rice, and noodles and they've all been great! Portion size is good and all the dishes come with plenty of veggies and egg as well. The tofu has also always been well cooked unlike some places where I've experienced semi raw chunks of tofu thrown in. Overall, I love the variety and consistency of their food and I can't wait to try more combos in the future!"
475,"Won't stop until I've tried every single noodle/rice/sauce/meat combination!Toss is seriously SOOOOO bae!  It's a fun process or ordering because you get to pick your own noodles or rice, sauce and meat.  You make exactly what you want to eat and it's all very good quality!There's not much of a customer service aspect here because you order at the counter and then just wait for your food to be brought to you at the table.  I like that there are big pitchers of water for customers though so we can keep one at the table.  I can't stand not having enough beverage with my meal!Toss has the traditional thai restaurant sauces with the chili, jalepenos, etc. but they have one that's a smooth consistency and spicy and it is HEAVEN!!!  If you like spice, DEFINITELY use this to spice up your dishPros: you get to order exactly what you want every time.  There are so many combinations of orders to get here and they're all equally good.cons: people who haven't been tend to order as if they've never heard of food before and might take a while if they're not used to the ordering process here, so beware.  TIP! if you order curry with noodles, I like to ask them to put them together so I don't have to mix in the noodles with the sauce myself.  It lets the noodles absorb more curry sauce.  It's SO good!Toss is definitely a fun place to come with friends for a fun dinner with delicious food and great atmosphere!  The staff is friendly and they make DELICIOUS food that will always leave you wanting to come back again!"
476,"Thai-Hokkien-beef YASS! My go-to noodle bar whenever I'm back in NorCal! You honestly can't go wrong with any combo here. Everything is delicious --even the Tom yum is up to par with my standards. Coconut prawns were also pretty tasty, but nothing to get super hyped about"
477,"Filling noodle dishes for good prices. Toss Noodle Bar made the order process simple: choose one of four different noodles, your meat/tofu, and your sauce. I personally liked the Hokkein noodles with shrimp and peanut sauce. Was quite delicious! Although the restaurant was packed the food came out quick. You gotta clean up after yourself but I'm happily doing so as the noodles were great and the prices aiiiiiright!"
478,"I've come several times in the past and ended up staring at a bunch of flies zooming around the restaurant entrance.  Pretty unappetizing for me...For some reason, a lot of my friends want to come here for dinner so I've been way more times than I would've chosen to.   You can choose your noodles/rice, protein, and sauce (or make it a soup).  The meal comes out to around $10, which is pretty decent.  My favorite combo has to be the the Hokkien noodle with chicken and peanut sauce.  Don't get me wrong.  The food is good.  I just don't really get the hype.  There's generally always a place for you to sit after ordering at the register.  There's cute mason jars for your water needs."
479,"I  usually am a man with the determination to finish any meal I get at restaurants, but when it comes to Toss Noodle Bar's bowls, they are so generous that I can't finish them; however, it's great because that means I can get some of that deliciousness for leftovers. Truly large portions with delicious soups like their sour and spicy tomyum.Honestly, do not come here for anything but the noodles. The curry or stir fry portions are not so filling and they cost as much as the soups because they charge based on the meat, so go for the bowls!Biggest plus is that they do not kick you out for bringing in outside drinks for example. Come here a lot with friends out of random bursts of cravings and I've come in with coffee or boba and they do not have a problem with that, which is great!"
480,"I love them nooDZ NOODZ nOODZ, noodz i do adooreeseriously this place is amazeballs. I love that you can customize your entire order. I was so excited coming in here because I saw the different variations you can do, as well as the other yummy appetizers they had on the menu! I got the spinach noodles with half malay(peanut) and half thai(spicy) with chicken as my protein. I like that the stir fry option already comes with lots of vegetables and egg. The two sauces combined gave it a nice creamy texture. The thai spicy sauce wasnt spicy at all! The noodles were cooked perfectlyThe bf got the thin rice tom yum soup with chicken. I didnt get to try a lot of it, but the soup was tom yum soup was yummmyyWe also got the TOSS beef salad. I was kinda dejected because I saw a picture of it on the yelp page and it looked really good, like a steak salad. But when it came out, it was more like a vietnamese lemongrass beef salad instead. I really wanted to try their croquette and samosas but when I got there, they didn't have it on their menu! I was kinda disappointed.Anyways it was self serve after they bring you your food. They had cute mason jars for you to fill up at the water station and a bucket to put your dirty bowls. I only noticed this after but if you look at the TOSS symbol, you can notice that the T and O make a wok and the S S are noodles! This is a cheap and easy meal. Parking sucks because it's so crowded and in downtown"
481,"A decent place to grab a quick dinner downtown, and cheaper than most places downtown.It's a build you own noodle/rice bowl, where you select you noodle/rice type, protein, and sauce. I really like the hokkien and spinach noodles (they maintain a good chew), usually with chicken and the Chinese or Japanese sauce. The portions are ok, you don't get a lot of the protein for what you pay, but it's tasty and again, it's much cheaper than most other places downtown. I've also tried their curry, which is alright- I'd still probably go somewhere that's just Thai food like Racha or Thai noodle for curry, but the curry here isn't bad. The restaurant itself is pretty cute, with a good range of tables for small to large groups (you order then seat yourself). One weird thing about it is that there's always flies hovering around the door? Nothing major and they're not inside the restaurant but it isn't the most pleasant experience walking into the restaurant."
482,"This place is an upscale fast food restaurant basically. The service is quick but the food is just alright. Definitely can be a quick fix for comfort food for those Asian college students who miss their parents cooking. You basically have control of what you put in your bowl. There are three options: rice, noodles, or fried rice. From there, you then choose your sauces, veggies, and/or meat. I got the soup with glass noodle, Tom Yum base, and beef. Tasted okay. The soup wasn't as strong like other Thai places and I would have also been okay with not finishing my meal. After you order, it's mostly self service. There's water on the side of the restaurant with cute Mason jars. However this establishment is quite small so I would not recommend large parties."
483,"Noodles for everyone! Toss is a great place to go when you can't decide what type of asian flavor, you particularly want. It's great for a group of people who just can't decide on one type of asian food. Hidden next to UA Berkeley Theaters, Toss is a casual asian fusion restaurant where you are able to combine different noodles, sauces, and meats. I've been to this place throughout my years at Berkeley and it never fails to satisfy my hunger for asian noodles. I usually get the hokkien noodles, which is a thick yellow egg noodles that absorbs the sauce you choose. I've tried most of the sauces but the best one would have to be the Malay peanut sauce. It adds a hearty peanut flavor to the noodles that I haven't seen anywhere else. If you aren't in the mood for any of the sauces the Laska, which is a curry coconut soup is perfect for a cold day. Make sure to ask for spicy or add your own spices, since it usually comes out bland without it. There is also rice dishes, but they never seem to be worth getting. The only complaint I have is that the sauces lack a depth of flavors like restaurants that focus on only one or two noodle dishes. However, for only $10 dollars, Toss has good portions sizes that is good for lunch and dinner!"
484,"Affordable, good place by campus for food. Choose your own noodles, sauce, veggies, meat, etc and they'll make it for you. Portion sizes are good, but nothing's amazing since you have the risk of putting not so great things together. Protip: get what you think you'll like."
485,This is your quick fast casual for noodles. You get to choose the type of noodles sauce and protein I got the hokkien noodles with Thai and Malay with chicken. It came out super quickly and each dish comes in a big bowl. It also comes with a bunch of different vegetables in the dish. It tasted slightly sweet but a little spicy but not too much. I wanted to get extra chili to spice it up! The noodles were stir fry quickly and I can see the wok hey markings on the noodles. It's around $10/$11 for each so it's a quick bite to eat. Just walk in and go directly to the counter. The waiter will give you a number and bring the food to you. Parking is rough in the area. I usually park near YMCA or the park a couple blocks away and walk here. Grab some noodles and walk it off in downtown Berkeley!
486,"Toss Noddle Bar is probably my favorite noodle place in all of Berkeley, and I don't know why I didn't go here since freshman year. TO be honest, I don't even remember what I ordered since I came a while back ago, but all I can tell you is that there isn't anything that can go wrong.Think of it as a subway, for noodles. haha, it's so customizable, and they even let you combine spaces which was pretty neat! This place isn't really great for large groups, which can be a downfall, but groups of 4 are perfect."
487,"I found this little gem while browsing in the search section on Yelp and have been coming back ever since.It is soooooo freaking good OMG. It's a design your own but they do have pre-set items that go in it. For instance, it comes with noodles but you get to pick which style you want. I always get hokkien noodles. They are thick like chow mein for those that are unfamiliar with the names. It comes with meat but you get to choose which one or two you want. Typically I get chicken but I have tried the combo and got chicken and prawn. The prawn wasn't cooked all the way : ( you pick your sauce of choice, I always get the Thai sauce. It's spicey. All noodle options come with veggies.For less than $10 and very filling. Yes! You can't beat that. I gave 4 stars just for the half cooked prawn. It happened both times I ordered the combo so I cannot even say it was an accident the first time. If I had known the shrimp would still be see through i wouldn't have ordered the combo. I ordered it a second time thinking maybe the first time it was an accident, so I tried again. Whomp, same issue. Some people may like it like that, but nah, if I wanted a shrimp cocktail I went somewhere that had that on the menu."

It happened both times I ordered the combo so I cannot even say it was an accident the first time. If I had known the shrimp would still be see through i wouldn't have ordered the combo. I ordered it a second time thinking maybe the first time it was an accident, so I tried again. Whomp, same issue. Some people may like it like that, but nah, if I wanted a shrimp cocktail I went somewhere that had that on the menu."
508,"The prices are reasonable and the food is tasty but the place is a little dirty and there are usually some flies around the restaurant. Water is self serve and you're supposed to bring your dishes to the their dish tray when you're done.I ordered the hokkaido noodles with Thai sauce and beef and the portions were fairly large. Overall, it is a pretty good place for a quick and tasty bite that won't break the bank."
509,"Alongside the busy strip of Shattuck Avenue lies a somewhat hidden Toss Noodle Bar where one can customize their noodles to their liking.I've tried this place a couple times now and I find the concept to be quite interesting. All in all, it's similar to Pieology and Chipotle, but for noodles. Choose your meats, sauce, type of noodles, and etc. based on your own preferences and they'll make it for you. I've tried various combinations and for the price, I did enjoy what I got though I found that no matter what I chose the enjoyment per bite depreciated very quickly. I feel that Toss is special in it's wide variety of possible combinations, but in that variety, there is a lack of specialization and passion for the food it serves due to it's concept of personal customization. Overall, I would say it's a fun experience to try, but for a good noodle dish, I would prefer a location where the chef understands the flavors and combinations that work to make a fulfilling mix of flavors with personality."
510,"Our family got caught in the pouring rain but thank goodness for Toss Noodle Bar!This eatery serves up noodle dishes, soups and rice bowls in a casual setting. Order up at the counter, pay and grab your own utensils and water. You clean up after yourself too! Why am I a fan of these places? because they keep the costs low. Most dishes are $10 or less!Whether easy or picky eaters, everyone has the freedom to choose whatever combo they want. You choose your base (noodle or rice), add your sauce (laksa, peanut sauce, hoisin, etc) add your meat. Then you can say if you just want it plain stir fry or in a soup. You can get your pho fix here too!I wasn't absurdly hungry so I ordered a bunch of appetizers for myself and for the table: chicken satay ($6), fried croquettes ($5), tofu salad ($4) coconut shrimp ($6).  Everything was cooked just right and had delicious accompanying sauces. Yum.Thanks Toss for keeping our family lunch affordable and fun! There was definitely a choice for everyone."
511,"When I first walked through the doors of Toss, there was a strange odor, almost like wet dog smell. I knew I wasn't alone, because the person I was with, who also happened to be the one who suggested Toss to me, also smelled it. The smell did not last long, it's just not what I was expecting from a restaurant. The menu is very simple. You pick what type of noodles you want (rice also available), then you choose the sauce you want it tossed in, and finally you choose your meat option. I went with wheat noodles, Thai sauce, and chicken. The food came out very quick. The wheat noodles are skinny noodles, which I prefer because it's easier to eat, in my opinion. I love the fresh veggies they use, and the Thai sauce was awesome. We also shared a plate of garlic edamame. The garlic were nice sized pieces, and fresh. The edamame is tossed in soy sauce, which adds another welcome flavor element. The restaurant has a nice, chill vibe to it. They havr a water station, where you can pour your own water, and the water itself is spa water (cucumber slices in it). In the end, they serve great food at a great price."
512,"We were looking for soup on a Thursday night. We couldn't believe how difficult it was to find soup or even a restaurant that's open past 8:30 pm.  This place was perfect. We created a bowl of soup - hokkien noodles, clear soup, and chicken. The waitress brought it to our table; nice and hot with good flavor.  Everything we saw being delivered to customers looked good. There's so many choices in designing your own meal. Stop in and try one; you won't be disappointed."
513,"I really do enjoy the noodles at this restaurant but I'm giving this review only 2 stars because the portion sizes at Toss is very disappointing. I started coming here a couple of years ago and every single time I come, the amount of noodles that actually go into my bowl heavily decreases. Noodles are pretty cheap, I could literally buy 3 noodle plates in Chinatown for less than $15. BUT I'm paying around $10-$13 at Toss for a bowl of noodles that barely reach the middle of my bowl. The last and final time I came here, I ordered the hokkien noodles with Thai sauce and beef, when the lady brought out my noodles, I could literally see the bottom of the bowl... THATS HOW LITTLE NOODLES I GOT! Are you serious Toss? I'm not blind. I had to go up to the cashier and let her know how disappointed I was before a new bowl was brought out to me. Overall, the noodles here are good, but since it seems like a ten dollar bill gets me less than half a bowl of noodles, I'll go spend my money at Imm Thai instead."
514,"I've come here a few times and now and ordered something different each time and have yet to be disappointed! You choose your base first: noodle, rice, or fried rice. There are 5 types of noodles and the option for white or brown rice. Then you pick the flavour you want. There are 5 different stir fry flavours as well as the option to get curry! Finally you pick a protein - tofu is the only vegetarian option and there's also plenty of meat options.I've had curry, fried rice, and noodles and they've all been great! Portion size is good and all the dishes come with plenty of veggies and egg as well. The tofu has also always been well cooked unlike some places where I've experienced semi raw chunks of tofu thrown in. Overall, I love the variety and consistency of their food and I can't wait to try more combos in the future!"
515,"Won't stop until I've tried every single noodle/rice/sauce/meat combination!Toss is seriously SOOOOO bae!  It's a fun process or ordering because you get to pick your own noodles or rice, sauce and meat.  You make exactly what you want to eat and it's all very good quality!There's not much of a customer service aspect here because you order at the counter and then just wait for your food to be brought to you at the table.  I like that there are big pitchers of water for customers though so we can keep one at the table.  I can't stand not having enough beverage with my meal!Toss has the traditional thai restaurant sauces with the chili, jalepenos, etc. but they have one that's a smooth consistency and spicy and it is HEAVEN!!!  If you like spice, DEFINITELY use this to spice up your dishPros: you get to order exactly what you want every time.  There are so many combinations of orders to get here and they're all equally good.cons: people who haven't been tend to order as if they've never heard of food before and might take a while if they're not used to the ordering process here, so beware.  TIP! if you order curry with noodles, I like to ask them to put them together so I don't have to mix in the noodles with the sauce myself.  It lets the noodles absorb more curry sauce.  It's SO good!Toss is definitely a fun place to come with friends for a fun dinner with delicious food and great atmosphere!  The staff is friendly and they make DELICIOUS food that will always leave you wanting to come back again!"
516,"Thai-Hokkien-beef YASS! My go-to noodle bar whenever I'm back in NorCal! You honestly can't go wrong with any combo here. Everything is delicious --even the Tom yum is up to par with my standards. Coconut prawns were also pretty tasty, but nothing to get super hyped about"
517,"Filling noodle dishes for good prices. Toss Noodle Bar made the order process simple: choose one of four different noodles, your meat/tofu, and your sauce. I personally liked the Hokkein noodles with shrimp and peanut sauce. Was quite delicious! Although the restaurant was packed the food came out quick. You gotta clean up after yourself but I'm happily doing so as the noodles were great and the prices aiiiiiright!"
518,"I've come several times in the past and ended up staring at a bunch of flies zooming around the restaurant entrance.  Pretty unappetizing for me...For some reason, a lot of my friends want to come here for dinner so I've been way more times than I would've chosen to.   You can choose your noodles/rice, protein, and sauce (or make it a soup).  The meal comes out to around $10, which is pretty decent.  My favorite combo has to be the the Hokkien noodle with chicken and peanut sauce.  Don't get me wrong.  The food is good.  I just don't really get the hype.  There's generally always a place for you to sit after ordering at the register.  There's cute mason jars for your water needs."
519,"I  usually am a man with the determination to finish any meal I get at restaurants, but when it comes to Toss Noodle Bar's bowls, they are so generous that I can't finish them; however, it's great because that means I can get some of that deliciousness for leftovers. Truly large portions with delicious soups like their sour and spicy tomyum.Honestly, do not come here for anything but the noodles. The curry or stir fry portions are not so filling and they cost as much as the soups because they charge based on the meat, so go for the bowls!Biggest plus is that they do not kick you out for bringing in outside drinks for example. Come here a lot with friends out of random bursts of cravings and I've come in with coffee or boba and they do not have a problem with that, which is great!"
520,"I love them nooDZ NOODZ nOODZ, noodz i do adooreeseriously this place is amazeballs. I love that you can customize your entire order. I was so excited coming in here because I saw the different variations you can do, as well as the other yummy appetizers they had on the menu! I got the spinach noodles with half malay(peanut) and half thai(spicy) with chicken as my protein. I like that the stir fry option already comes with lots of vegetables and egg. The two sauces combined gave it a nice creamy texture. The thai spicy sauce wasnt spicy at all! The noodles were cooked perfectlyThe bf got the thin rice tom yum soup with chicken. I didnt get to try a lot of it, but the soup was tom yum soup was yummmyyWe also got the TOSS beef salad. I was kinda dejected because I saw a picture of it on the yelp page and it looked really good, like a steak salad. But when it came out, it was more like a vietnamese lemongrass beef salad instead. I really wanted to try their croquette and samosas but when I got there, they didn't have it on their menu! I was kinda disappointed.Anyways it was self serve after they bring you your food. They had cute mason jars for you to fill up at the water station and a bucket to put your dirty bowls. I only noticed this after but if you look at the TOSS symbol, you can notice that the T and O make a wok and the S S are noodles! This is a cheap and easy meal. Parking sucks because it's so crowded and in downtown"
521,"A decent place to grab a quick dinner downtown, and cheaper than most places downtown.It's a build you own noodle/rice bowl, where you select you noodle/rice type, protein, and sauce. I really like the hokkien and spinach noodles (they maintain a good chew), usually with chicken and the Chinese or Japanese sauce. The portions are ok, you don't get a lot of the protein for what you pay, but it's tasty and again, it's much cheaper than most other places downtown. I've also tried their curry, which is alright- I'd still probably go somewhere that's just Thai food like Racha or Thai noodle for curry, but the curry here isn't bad. The restaurant itself is pretty cute, with a good range of tables for small to large groups (you order then seat yourself). One weird thing about it is that there's always flies hovering around the door? Nothing major and they're not inside the restaurant but it isn't the most pleasant experience walking into the restaurant."
522,"This place is an upscale fast food restaurant basically. The service is quick but the food is just alright. Definitely can be a quick fix for comfort food for those Asian college students who miss their parents cooking. You basically have control of what you put in your bowl. There are three options: rice, noodles, or fried rice. From there, you then choose your sauces, veggies, and/or meat. I got the soup with glass noodle, Tom Yum base, and beef. Tasted okay. The soup wasn't as strong like other Thai places and I would have also been okay with not finishing my meal. After you order, it's mostly self service. There's water on the side of the restaurant with cute Mason jars. However this establishment is quite small so I would not recommend large parties."
523,"Noodles for everyone! Toss is a great place to go when you can't decide what type of asian flavor, you particularly want. It's great for a group of people who just can't decide on one type of asian food. Hidden next to UA Berkeley Theaters, Toss is a casual asian fusion restaurant where you are able to combine different noodles, sauces, and meats. I've been to this place throughout my years at Berkeley and it never fails to satisfy my hunger for asian noodles. I usually get the hokkien noodles, which is a thick yellow egg noodles that absorbs the sauce you choose. I've tried most of the sauces but the best one would have to be the Malay peanut sauce. It adds a hearty peanut flavor to the noodles that I haven't seen anywhere else. If you aren't in the mood for any of the sauces the Laska, which is a curry coconut soup is perfect for a cold day. Make sure to ask for spicy or add your own spices, since it usually comes out bland without it. There is also rice dishes, but they never seem to be worth getting. The only complaint I have is that the sauces lack a depth of flavors like restaurants that focus on only one or two noodle dishes. However, for only $10 dollars, Toss has good portions sizes that is good for lunch and dinner!"
524,"Affordable, good place by campus for food. Choose your own noodles, sauce, veggies, meat, etc and they'll make it for you. Portion sizes are good, but nothing's amazing since you have the risk of putting not so great things together. Protip: get what you think you'll like."
525,This is your quick fast casual for noodles. You get to choose the type of noodles sauce and protein I got the hokkien noodles with Thai and Malay with chicken. It came out super quickly and each dish comes in a big bowl. It also comes with a bunch of different vegetables in the dish. It tasted slightly sweet but a little spicy but not too much. I wanted to get extra chili to spice it up! The noodles were stir fry quickly and I can see the wok hey markings on the noodles. It's around $10/$11 for each so it's a quick bite to eat. Just walk in and go directly to the counter. The waiter will give you a number and bring the food to you. Parking is rough in the area. I usually park near YMCA or the park a couple blocks away and walk here. Grab some noodles and walk it off in downtown Berkeley!
526,"Toss Noddle Bar is probably my favorite noodle place in all of Berkeley, and I don't know why I didn't go here since freshman year. TO be honest, I don't even remember what I ordered since I came a while back ago, but all I can tell you is that there isn't anything that can go wrong.Think of it as a subway, for noodles. haha, it's so customizable, and they even let you combine spaces which was pretty neat! This place isn't really great for large groups, which can be a downfall, but groups of 4 are perfect."
527,"I found this little gem while browsing in the search section on Yelp and have been coming back ever since.It is soooooo freaking good OMG. It's a design your own but they do have pre-set items that go in it. For instance, it comes with noodles but you get to pick which style you want. I always get hokkien noodles. They are thick like chow mein for those that are unfamiliar with the names. It comes with meat but you get to choose which one or two you want. Typically I get chicken but I have tried the combo and got chicken and prawn. The prawn wasn't cooked all the way : ( you pick your sauce of choice, I always get the Thai sauce. It's spicey.

It's a design your own but they do have pre-set items that go in it. For instance, it comes with noodles but you get to pick which style you want. I always get hokkien noodles. They are thick like chow mein for those that are unfamiliar with the names. It comes with meat but you get to choose which one or two you want. Typically I get chicken but I have tried the combo and got chicken and prawn. The prawn wasn't cooked all the way : ( you pick your sauce of choice, I always get the Thai sauce. It's spicey. All noodle options come with veggies.For less than $10 and very filling. Yes! You can't beat that. I gave 4 stars just for the half cooked prawn. It happened both times I ordered the combo so I cannot even say it was an accident the first time. If I had known the shrimp would still be see through i wouldn't have ordered the combo. I ordered it a second time thinking maybe the first time it was an accident, so I tried again. Whomp, same issue. Some people may like it like that, but nah, if I wanted a shrimp cocktail I went somewhere that had that on the menu."
548,"The prices are reasonable and the food is tasty but the place is a little dirty and there are usually some flies around the restaurant. Water is self serve and you're supposed to bring your dishes to the their dish tray when you're done.I ordered the hokkaido noodles with Thai sauce and beef and the portions were fairly large. Overall, it is a pretty good place for a quick and tasty bite that won't break the bank."
549,"Alongside the busy strip of Shattuck Avenue lies a somewhat hidden Toss Noodle Bar where one can customize their noodles to their liking.I've tried this place a couple times now and I find the concept to be quite interesting. All in all, it's similar to Pieology and Chipotle, but for noodles. Choose your meats, sauce, type of noodles, and etc. based on your own preferences and they'll make it for you. I've tried various combinations and for the price, I did enjoy what I got though I found that no matter what I chose the enjoyment per bite depreciated very quickly. I feel that Toss is special in it's wide variety of possible combinations, but in that variety, there is a lack of specialization and passion for the food it serves due to it's concept of personal customization. Overall, I would say it's a fun experience to try, but for a good noodle dish, I would prefer a location where the chef understands the flavors and combinations that work to make a fulfilling mix of flavors with personality."
550,"Our family got caught in the pouring rain but thank goodness for Toss Noodle Bar!This eatery serves up noodle dishes, soups and rice bowls in a casual setting. Order up at the counter, pay and grab your own utensils and water. You clean up after yourself too! Why am I a fan of these places? because they keep the costs low. Most dishes are $10 or less!Whether easy or picky eaters, everyone has the freedom to choose whatever combo they want. You choose your base (noodle or rice), add your sauce (laksa, peanut sauce, hoisin, etc) add your meat. Then you can say if you just want it plain stir fry or in a soup. You can get your pho fix here too!I wasn't absurdly hungry so I ordered a bunch of appetizers for myself and for the table: chicken satay ($6), fried croquettes ($5), tofu salad ($4) coconut shrimp ($6).  Everything was cooked just right and had delicious accompanying sauces. Yum.Thanks Toss for keeping our family lunch affordable and fun! There was definitely a choice for everyone."
551,"When I first walked through the doors of Toss, there was a strange odor, almost like wet dog smell. I knew I wasn't alone, because the person I was with, who also happened to be the one who suggested Toss to me, also smelled it. The smell did not last long, it's just not what I was expecting from a restaurant. The menu is very simple. You pick what type of noodles you want (rice also available), then you choose the sauce you want it tossed in, and finally you choose your meat option. I went with wheat noodles, Thai sauce, and chicken. The food came out very quick. The wheat noodles are skinny noodles, which I prefer because it's easier to eat, in my opinion. I love the fresh veggies they use, and the Thai sauce was awesome. We also shared a plate of garlic edamame. The garlic were nice sized pieces, and fresh. The edamame is tossed in soy sauce, which adds another welcome flavor element. The restaurant has a nice, chill vibe to it. They havr a water station, where you can pour your own water, and the water itself is spa water (cucumber slices in it). In the end, they serve great food at a great price."
552,"We were looking for soup on a Thursday night. We couldn't believe how difficult it was to find soup or even a restaurant that's open past 8:30 pm.  This place was perfect. We created a bowl of soup - hokkien noodles, clear soup, and chicken. The waitress brought it to our table; nice and hot with good flavor.  Everything we saw being delivered to customers looked good. There's so many choices in designing your own meal. Stop in and try one; you won't be disappointed."
553,"I really do enjoy the noodles at this restaurant but I'm giving this review only 2 stars because the portion sizes at Toss is very disappointing. I started coming here a couple of years ago and every single time I come, the amount of noodles that actually go into my bowl heavily decreases. Noodles are pretty cheap, I could literally buy 3 noodle plates in Chinatown for less than $15. BUT I'm paying around $10-$13 at Toss for a bowl of noodles that barely reach the middle of my bowl. The last and final time I came here, I ordered the hokkien noodles with Thai sauce and beef, when the lady brought out my noodles, I could literally see the bottom of the bowl... THATS HOW LITTLE NOODLES I GOT! Are you serious Toss? I'm not blind. I had to go up to the cashier and let her know how disappointed I was before a new bowl was brought out to me. Overall, the noodles here are good, but since it seems like a ten dollar bill gets me less than half a bowl of noodles, I'll go spend my money at Imm Thai instead."
554,"I've come here a few times and now and ordered something different each time and have yet to be disappointed! You choose your base first: noodle, rice, or fried rice. There are 5 types of noodles and the option for white or brown rice. Then you pick the flavour you want. There are 5 different stir fry flavours as well as the option to get curry! Finally you pick a protein - tofu is the only vegetarian option and there's also plenty of meat options.I've had curry, fried rice, and noodles and they've all been great! Portion size is good and all the dishes come with plenty of veggies and egg as well. The tofu has also always been well cooked unlike some places where I've experienced semi raw chunks of tofu thrown in. Overall, I love the variety and consistency of their food and I can't wait to try more combos in the future!"
555,"Won't stop until I've tried every single noodle/rice/sauce/meat combination!Toss is seriously SOOOOO bae!  It's a fun process or ordering because you get to pick your own noodles or rice, sauce and meat.  You make exactly what you want to eat and it's all very good quality!There's not much of a customer service aspect here because you order at the counter and then just wait for your food to be brought to you at the table.  I like that there are big pitchers of water for customers though so we can keep one at the table.  I can't stand not having enough beverage with my meal!Toss has the traditional thai restaurant sauces with the chili, jalepenos, etc. but they have one that's a smooth consistency and spicy and it is HEAVEN!!!  If you like spice, DEFINITELY use this to spice up your dishPros: you get to order exactly what you want every time.  There are so many combinations of orders to get here and they're all equally good.cons: people who haven't been tend to order as if they've never heard of food before and might take a while if they're not used to the ordering process here, so beware.  TIP! if you order curry with noodles, I like to ask them to put them together so I don't have to mix in the noodles with the sauce myself.  It lets the noodles absorb more curry sauce.  It's SO good!Toss is definitely a fun place to come with friends for a fun dinner with delicious food and great atmosphere!  The staff is friendly and they make DELICIOUS food that will always leave you wanting to come back again!"
556,"Thai-Hokkien-beef YASS! My go-to noodle bar whenever I'm back in NorCal! You honestly can't go wrong with any combo here. Everything is delicious --even the Tom yum is up to par with my standards. Coconut prawns were also pretty tasty, but nothing to get super hyped about"
557,"Filling noodle dishes for good prices. Toss Noodle Bar made the order process simple: choose one of four different noodles, your meat/tofu, and your sauce. I personally liked the Hokkein noodles with shrimp and peanut sauce. Was quite delicious! Although the restaurant was packed the food came out quick. You gotta clean up after yourself but I'm happily doing so as the noodles were great and the prices aiiiiiright!"
558,"I've come several times in the past and ended up staring at a bunch of flies zooming around the restaurant entrance.  Pretty unappetizing for me...For some reason, a lot of my friends want to come here for dinner so I've been way more times than I would've chosen to.   You can choose your noodles/rice, protein, and sauce (or make it a soup).  The meal comes out to around $10, which is pretty decent.  My favorite combo has to be the the Hokkien noodle with chicken and peanut sauce.  Don't get me wrong.  The food is good.  I just don't really get the hype.  There's generally always a place for you to sit after ordering at the register.  There's cute mason jars for your water needs."
559,"I  usually am a man with the determination to finish any meal I get at restaurants, but when it comes to Toss Noodle Bar's bowls, they are so generous that I can't finish them; however, it's great because that means I can get some of that deliciousness for leftovers. Truly large portions with delicious soups like their sour and spicy tomyum.Honestly, do not come here for anything but the noodles. The curry or stir fry portions are not so filling and they cost as much as the soups because they charge based on the meat, so go for the bowls!Biggest plus is that they do not kick you out for bringing in outside drinks for example. Come here a lot with friends out of random bursts of cravings and I've come in with coffee or boba and they do not have a problem with that, which is great!"
560,"I love them nooDZ NOODZ nOODZ, noodz i do adooreeseriously this place is amazeballs. I love that you can customize your entire order. I was so excited coming in here because I saw the different variations you can do, as well as the other yummy appetizers they had on the menu! I got the spinach noodles with half malay(peanut) and half thai(spicy) with chicken as my protein. I like that the stir fry option already comes with lots of vegetables and egg. The two sauces combined gave it a nice creamy texture. The thai spicy sauce wasnt spicy at all! The noodles were cooked perfectlyThe bf got the thin rice tom yum soup with chicken. I didnt get to try a lot of it, but the soup was tom yum soup was yummmyyWe also got the TOSS beef salad. I was kinda dejected because I saw a picture of it on the yelp page and it looked really good, like a steak salad. But when it came out, it was more like a vietnamese lemongrass beef salad instead. I really wanted to try their croquette and samosas but when I got there, they didn't have it on their menu! I was kinda disappointed.Anyways it was self serve after they bring you your food. They had cute mason jars for you to fill up at the water station and a bucket to put your dirty bowls. I only noticed this after but if you look at the TOSS symbol, you can notice that the T and O make a wok and the S S are noodles! This is a cheap and easy meal. Parking sucks because it's so crowded and in downtown"
561,"A decent place to grab a quick dinner downtown, and cheaper than most places downtown.It's a build you own noodle/rice bowl, where you select you noodle/rice type, protein, and sauce. I really like the hokkien and spinach noodles (they maintain a good chew), usually with chicken and the Chinese or Japanese sauce. The portions are ok, you don't get a lot of the protein for what you pay, but it's tasty and again, it's much cheaper than most other places downtown. I've also tried their curry, which is alright- I'd still probably go somewhere that's just Thai food like Racha or Thai noodle for curry, but the curry here isn't bad. The restaurant itself is pretty cute, with a good range of tables for small to large groups (you order then seat yourself). One weird thing about it is that there's always flies hovering around the door? Nothing major and they're not inside the restaurant but it isn't the most pleasant experience walking into the restaurant."
562,"This place is an upscale fast food restaurant basically. The service is quick but the food is just alright. Definitely can be a quick fix for comfort food for those Asian college students who miss their parents cooking. You basically have control of what you put in your bowl. There are three options: rice, noodles, or fried rice. From there, you then choose your sauces, veggies, and/or meat. I got the soup with glass noodle, Tom Yum base, and beef. Tasted okay. The soup wasn't as strong like other Thai places and I would have also been okay with not finishing my meal. After you order, it's mostly self service. There's water on the side of the restaurant with cute Mason jars. However this establishment is quite small so I would not recommend large parties."
563,"Noodles for everyone! Toss is a great place to go when you can't decide what type of asian flavor, you particularly want. It's great for a group of people who just can't decide on one type of asian food. Hidden next to UA Berkeley Theaters, Toss is a casual asian fusion restaurant where you are able to combine different noodles, sauces, and meats. I've been to this place throughout my years at Berkeley and it never fails to satisfy my hunger for asian noodles. I usually get the hokkien noodles, which is a thick yellow egg noodles that absorbs the sauce you choose. I've tried most of the sauces but the best one would have to be the Malay peanut sauce. It adds a hearty peanut flavor to the noodles that I haven't seen anywhere else. If you aren't in the mood for any of the sauces the Laska, which is a curry coconut soup is perfect for a cold day. Make sure to ask for spicy or add your own spices, since it usually comes out bland without it. There is also rice dishes, but they never seem to be worth getting. The only complaint I have is that the sauces lack a depth of flavors like restaurants that focus on only one or two noodle dishes. However, for only $10 dollars, Toss has good portions sizes that is good for lunch and dinner!"
564,"Affordable, good place by campus for food. Choose your own noodles, sauce, veggies, meat, etc and they'll make it for you. Portion sizes are good, but nothing's amazing since you have the risk of putting not so great things together. Protip: get what you think you'll like."
565,This is your quick fast casual for noodles. You get to choose the type of noodles sauce and protein I got the hokkien noodles with Thai and Malay with chicken. It came out super quickly and each dish comes in a big bowl. It also comes with a bunch of different vegetables in the dish. It tasted slightly sweet but a little spicy but not too much. I wanted to get extra chili to spice it up! The noodles were stir fry quickly and I can see the wok hey markings on the noodles. It's around $10/$11 for each so it's a quick bite to eat. Just walk in and go directly to the counter. The waiter will give you a number and bring the food to you. Parking is rough in the area. I usually park near YMCA or the park a couple blocks away and walk here. Grab some noodles and walk it off in downtown Berkeley!
566,"Toss Noddle Bar is probably my favorite noodle place in all of Berkeley, and I don't know why I didn't go here since freshman year. TO be honest, I don't even remember what I ordered since I came a while back ago, but all I can tell you is that there isn't anything that can go wrong.Think of it as a subway, for noodles. haha, it's so customizable, and they even let you combine spaces which was pretty neat! This place isn't really great for large groups, which can be a downfall, but groups of 4 are perfect."

TO be honest, I don't even remember what I ordered since I came a while back ago, but all I can tell you is that there isn't anything that can go wrong.Think of it as a subway, for noodles. haha, it's so customizable, and they even let you combine spaces which was pretty neat! This place isn't really great for large groups, which can be a downfall, but groups of 4 are perfect."
587,"I found this little gem while browsing in the search section on Yelp and have been coming back ever since.It is soooooo freaking good OMG. It's a design your own but they do have pre-set items that go in it. For instance, it comes with noodles but you get to pick which style you want. I always get hokkien noodles. They are thick like chow mein for those that are unfamiliar with the names. It comes with meat but you get to choose which one or two you want. Typically I get chicken but I have tried the combo and got chicken and prawn. The prawn wasn't cooked all the way : ( you pick your sauce of choice, I always get the Thai sauce. It's spicey. All noodle options come with veggies.For less than $10 and very filling. Yes! You can't beat that. I gave 4 stars just for the half cooked prawn. It happened both times I ordered the combo so I cannot even say it was an accident the first time. If I had known the shrimp would still be see through i wouldn't have ordered the combo. I ordered it a second time thinking maybe the first time it was an accident, so I tried again. Whomp, same issue. Some people may like it like that, but nah, if I wanted a shrimp cocktail I went somewhere that had that on the menu."
588,"The prices are reasonable and the food is tasty but the place is a little dirty and there are usually some flies around the restaurant. Water is self serve and you're supposed to bring your dishes to the their dish tray when you're done.I ordered the hokkaido noodles with Thai sauce and beef and the portions were fairly large. Overall, it is a pretty good place for a quick and tasty bite that won't break the bank."
589,"Alongside the busy strip of Shattuck Avenue lies a somewhat hidden Toss Noodle Bar where one can customize their noodles to their liking.I've tried this place a couple times now and I find the concept to be quite interesting. All in all, it's similar to Pieology and Chipotle, but for noodles. Choose your meats, sauce, type of noodles, and etc. based on your own preferences and they'll make it for you. I've tried various combinations and for the price, I did enjoy what I got though I found that no matter what I chose the enjoyment per bite depreciated very quickly. I feel that Toss is special in it's wide variety of possible combinations, but in that variety, there is a lack of specialization and passion for the food it serves due to it's concept of personal customization. Overall, I would say it's a fun experience to try, but for a good noodle dish, I would prefer a location where the chef understands the flavors and combinations that work to make a fulfilling mix of flavors with personality."
590,"Our family got caught in the pouring rain but thank goodness for Toss Noodle Bar!This eatery serves up noodle dishes, soups and rice bowls in a casual setting. Order up at the counter, pay and grab your own utensils and water. You clean up after yourself too! Why am I a fan of these places? because they keep the costs low. Most dishes are $10 or less!Whether easy or picky eaters, everyone has the freedom to choose whatever combo they want. You choose your base (noodle or rice), add your sauce (laksa, peanut sauce, hoisin, etc) add your meat. Then you can say if you just want it plain stir fry or in a soup. You can get your pho fix here too!I wasn't absurdly hungry so I ordered a bunch of appetizers for myself and for the table: chicken satay ($6), fried croquettes ($5), tofu salad ($4) coconut shrimp ($6).  Everything was cooked just right and had delicious accompanying sauces. Yum.Thanks Toss for keeping our family lunch affordable and fun! There was definitely a choice for everyone."
591,"When I first walked through the doors of Toss, there was a strange odor, almost like wet dog smell. I knew I wasn't alone, because the person I was with, who also happened to be the one who suggested Toss to me, also smelled it. The smell did not last long, it's just not what I was expecting from a restaurant. The menu is very simple. You pick what type of noodles you want (rice also available), then you choose the sauce you want it tossed in, and finally you choose your meat option. I went with wheat noodles, Thai sauce, and chicken. The food came out very quick. The wheat noodles are skinny noodles, which I prefer because it's easier to eat, in my opinion. I love the fresh veggies they use, and the Thai sauce was awesome. We also shared a plate of garlic edamame. The garlic were nice sized pieces, and fresh. The edamame is tossed in soy sauce, which adds another welcome flavor element. The restaurant has a nice, chill vibe to it. They havr a water station, where you can pour your own water, and the water itself is spa water (cucumber slices in it). In the end, they serve great food at a great price."
592,"We were looking for soup on a Thursday night. We couldn't believe how difficult it was to find soup or even a restaurant that's open past 8:30 pm.  This place was perfect. We created a bowl of soup - hokkien noodles, clear soup, and chicken. The waitress brought it to our table; nice and hot with good flavor.  Everything we saw being delivered to customers looked good. There's so many choices in designing your own meal. Stop in and try one; you won't be disappointed."
593,"I really do enjoy the noodles at this restaurant but I'm giving this review only 2 stars because the portion sizes at Toss is very disappointing. I started coming here a couple of years ago and every single time I come, the amount of noodles that actually go into my bowl heavily decreases. Noodles are pretty cheap, I could literally buy 3 noodle plates in Chinatown for less than $15. BUT I'm paying around $10-$13 at Toss for a bowl of noodles that barely reach the middle of my bowl. The last and final time I came here, I ordered the hokkien noodles with Thai sauce and beef, when the lady brought out my noodles, I could literally see the bottom of the bowl... THATS HOW LITTLE NOODLES I GOT! Are you serious Toss? I'm not blind. I had to go up to the cashier and let her know how disappointed I was before a new bowl was brought out to me. Overall, the noodles here are good, but since it seems like a ten dollar bill gets me less than half a bowl of noodles, I'll go spend my money at Imm Thai instead."
594,"I've come here a few times and now and ordered something different each time and have yet to be disappointed! You choose your base first: noodle, rice, or fried rice. There are 5 types of noodles and the option for white or brown rice. Then you pick the flavour you want. There are 5 different stir fry flavours as well as the option to get curry! Finally you pick a protein - tofu is the only vegetarian option and there's also plenty of meat options.I've had curry, fried rice, and noodles and they've all been great! Portion size is good and all the dishes come with plenty of veggies and egg as well. The tofu has also always been well cooked unlike some places where I've experienced semi raw chunks of tofu thrown in. Overall, I love the variety and consistency of their food and I can't wait to try more combos in the future!"
595,"Won't stop until I've tried every single noodle/rice/sauce/meat combination!Toss is seriously SOOOOO bae!  It's a fun process or ordering because you get to pick your own noodles or rice, sauce and meat.  You make exactly what you want to eat and it's all very good quality!There's not much of a customer service aspect here because you order at the counter and then just wait for your food to be brought to you at the table.  I like that there are big pitchers of water for customers though so we can keep one at the table.  I can't stand not having enough beverage with my meal!Toss has the traditional thai restaurant sauces with the chili, jalepenos, etc. but they have one that's a smooth consistency and spicy and it is HEAVEN!!!  If you like spice, DEFINITELY use this to spice up your dishPros: you get to order exactly what you want every time.  There are so many combinations of orders to get here and they're all equally good.cons: people who haven't been tend to order as if they've never heard of food before and might take a while if they're not used to the ordering process here, so beware.  TIP! if you order curry with noodles, I like to ask them to put them together so I don't have to mix in the noodles with the sauce myself.  It lets the noodles absorb more curry sauce.  It's SO good!Toss is definitely a fun place to come with friends for a fun dinner with delicious food and great atmosphere!  The staff is friendly and they make DELICIOUS food that will always leave you wanting to come back again!"
596,"Thai-Hokkien-beef YASS! My go-to noodle bar whenever I'm back in NorCal! You honestly can't go wrong with any combo here. Everything is delicious --even the Tom yum is up to par with my standards. Coconut prawns were also pretty tasty, but nothing to get super hyped about"
597,"Filling noodle dishes for good prices. Toss Noodle Bar made the order process simple: choose one of four different noodles, your meat/tofu, and your sauce. I personally liked the Hokkein noodles with shrimp and peanut sauce. Was quite delicious! Although the restaurant was packed the food came out quick. You gotta clean up after yourself but I'm happily doing so as the noodles were great and the prices aiiiiiright!"
598,"I've come several times in the past and ended up staring at a bunch of flies zooming around the restaurant entrance.  Pretty unappetizing for me...For some reason, a lot of my friends want to come here for dinner so I've been way more times than I would've chosen to.   You can choose your noodles/rice, protein, and sauce (or make it a soup).  The meal comes out to around $10, which is pretty decent.  My favorite combo has to be the the Hokkien noodle with chicken and peanut sauce.  Don't get me wrong.  The food is good.  I just don't really get the hype.  There's generally always a place for you to sit after ordering at the register.  There's cute mason jars for your water needs."
599,"I  usually am a man with the determination to finish any meal I get at restaurants, but when it comes to Toss Noodle Bar's bowls, they are so generous that I can't finish them; however, it's great because that means I can get some of that deliciousness for leftovers. Truly large portions with delicious soups like their sour and spicy tomyum.Honestly, do not come here for anything but the noodles. The curry or stir fry portions are not so filling and they cost as much as the soups because they charge based on the meat, so go for the bowls!Biggest plus is that they do not kick you out for bringing in outside drinks for example. Come here a lot with friends out of random bursts of cravings and I've come in with coffee or boba and they do not have a problem with that, which is great!"
600,"I love them nooDZ NOODZ nOODZ, noodz i do adooreeseriously this place is amazeballs. I love that you can customize your entire order. I was so excited coming in here because I saw the different variations you can do, as well as the other yummy appetizers they had on the menu! I got the spinach noodles with half malay(peanut) and half thai(spicy) with chicken as my protein. I like that the stir fry option already comes with lots of vegetables and egg. The two sauces combined gave it a nice creamy texture. The thai spicy sauce wasnt spicy at all! The noodles were cooked perfectlyThe bf got the thin rice tom yum soup with chicken. I didnt get to try a lot of it, but the soup was tom yum soup was yummmyyWe also got the TOSS beef salad. I was kinda dejected because I saw a picture of it on the yelp page and it looked really good, like a steak salad. But when it came out, it was more like a vietnamese lemongrass beef salad instead. I really wanted to try their croquette and samosas but when I got there, they didn't have it on their menu! I was kinda disappointed.Anyways it was self serve after they bring you your food. They had cute mason jars for you to fill up at the water station and a bucket to put your dirty bowls. I only noticed this after but if you look at the TOSS symbol, you can notice that the T and O make a wok and the S S are noodles! This is a cheap and easy meal. Parking sucks because it's so crowded and in downtown"
601,"A decent place to grab a quick dinner downtown, and cheaper than most places downtown.It's a build you own noodle/rice bowl, where you select you noodle/rice type, protein, and sauce. I really like the hokkien and spinach noodles (they maintain a good chew), usually with chicken and the Chinese or Japanese sauce. The portions are ok, you don't get a lot of the protein for what you pay, but it's tasty and again, it's much cheaper than most other places downtown. I've also tried their curry, which is alright- I'd still probably go somewhere that's just Thai food like Racha or Thai noodle for curry, but the curry here isn't bad. The restaurant itself is pretty cute, with a good range of tables for small to large groups (you order then seat yourself). One weird thing about it is that there's always flies hovering around the door? Nothing major and they're not inside the restaurant but it isn't the most pleasant experience walking into the restaurant."
602,"This place is an upscale fast food restaurant basically. The service is quick but the food is just alright. Definitely can be a quick fix for comfort food for those Asian college students who miss their parents cooking. You basically have control of what you put in your bowl. There are three options: rice, noodles, or fried rice. From there, you then choose your sauces, veggies, and/or meat. I got the soup with glass noodle, Tom Yum base, and beef. Tasted okay. The soup wasn't as strong like other Thai places and I would have also been okay with not finishing my meal. After you order, it's mostly self service. There's water on the side of the restaurant with cute Mason jars. However this establishment is quite small so I would not recommend large parties."
603,"Noodles for everyone! Toss is a great place to go when you can't decide what type of asian flavor, you particularly want. It's great for a group of people who just can't decide on one type of asian food. Hidden next to UA Berkeley Theaters, Toss is a casual asian fusion restaurant where you are able to combine different noodles, sauces, and meats. I've been to this place throughout my years at Berkeley and it never fails to satisfy my hunger for asian noodles. I usually get the hokkien noodles, which is a thick yellow egg noodles that absorbs the sauce you choose. I've tried most of the sauces but the best one would have to be the Malay peanut sauce. It adds a hearty peanut flavor to the noodles that I haven't seen anywhere else. If you aren't in the mood for any of the sauces the Laska, which is a curry coconut soup is perfect for a cold day. Make sure to ask for spicy or add your own spices, since it usually comes out bland without it. There is also rice dishes, but they never seem to be worth getting. The only complaint I have is that the sauces lack a depth of flavors like restaurants that focus on only one or two noodle dishes. However, for only $10 dollars, Toss has good portions sizes that is good for lunch and dinner!"
604,"Affordable, good place by campus for food. Choose your own noodles, sauce, veggies, meat, etc and they'll make it for you. Portion sizes are good, but nothing's amazing since you have the risk of putting not so great things together. Protip: get what you think you'll like."
605,This is your quick fast casual for noodles. You get to choose the type of noodles sauce and protein I got the hokkien noodles with Thai and Malay with chicken. It came out super quickly and each dish comes in a big bowl. It also comes with a bunch of different vegetables in the dish. It tasted slightly sweet but a little spicy but not too much. I wanted to get extra chili to spice it up! The noodles were stir fry quickly and I can see the wok hey markings on the noodles. It's around $10/$11 for each so it's a quick bite to eat. Just walk in and go directly to the counter. The waiter will give you a number and bring the food to you. Parking is rough in the area. I usually park near YMCA or the park a couple blocks away and walk here. Grab some noodles and walk it off in downtown Berkeley!

I wanted to get extra chili to spice it up! The noodles were stir fry quickly and I can see the wok hey markings on the noodles. It's around $10/$11 for each so it's a quick bite to eat. Just walk in and go directly to the counter. The waiter will give you a number and bring the food to you. Parking is rough in the area. I usually park near YMCA or the park a couple blocks away and walk here. Grab some noodles and walk it off in downtown Berkeley!
626,"Toss Noddle Bar is probably my favorite noodle place in all of Berkeley, and I don't know why I didn't go here since freshman year. TO be honest, I don't even remember what I ordered since I came a while back ago, but all I can tell you is that there isn't anything that can go wrong.Think of it as a subway, for noodles. haha, it's so customizable, and they even let you combine spaces which was pretty neat! This place isn't really great for large groups, which can be a downfall, but groups of 4 are perfect."
627,"I found this little gem while browsing in the search section on Yelp and have been coming back ever since.It is soooooo freaking good OMG. It's a design your own but they do have pre-set items that go in it. For instance, it comes with noodles but you get to pick which style you want. I always get hokkien noodles. They are thick like chow mein for those that are unfamiliar with the names. It comes with meat but you get to choose which one or two you want. Typically I get chicken but I have tried the combo and got chicken and prawn. The prawn wasn't cooked all the way : ( you pick your sauce of choice, I always get the Thai sauce. It's spicey. All noodle options come with veggies.For less than $10 and very filling. Yes! You can't beat that. I gave 4 stars just for the half cooked prawn. It happened both times I ordered the combo so I cannot even say it was an accident the first time. If I had known the shrimp would still be see through i wouldn't have ordered the combo. I ordered it a second time thinking maybe the first time it was an accident, so I tried again. Whomp, same issue. Some people may like it like that, but nah, if I wanted a shrimp cocktail I went somewhere that had that on the menu."
628,"The prices are reasonable and the food is tasty but the place is a little dirty and there are usually some flies around the restaurant. Water is self serve and you're supposed to bring your dishes to the their dish tray when you're done.I ordered the hokkaido noodles with Thai sauce and beef and the portions were fairly large. Overall, it is a pretty good place for a quick and tasty bite that won't break the bank."
629,"Alongside the busy strip of Shattuck Avenue lies a somewhat hidden Toss Noodle Bar where one can customize their noodles to their liking.I've tried this place a couple times now and I find the concept to be quite interesting. All in all, it's similar to Pieology and Chipotle, but for noodles. Choose your meats, sauce, type of noodles, and etc. based on your own preferences and they'll make it for you. I've tried various combinations and for the price, I did enjoy what I got though I found that no matter what I chose the enjoyment per bite depreciated very quickly. I feel that Toss is special in it's wide variety of possible combinations, but in that variety, there is a lack of specialization and passion for the food it serves due to it's concept of personal customization. Overall, I would say it's a fun experience to try, but for a good noodle dish, I would prefer a location where the chef understands the flavors and combinations that work to make a fulfilling mix of flavors with personality."
630,"Our family got caught in the pouring rain but thank goodness for Toss Noodle Bar!This eatery serves up noodle dishes, soups and rice bowls in a casual setting. Order up at the counter, pay and grab your own utensils and water. You clean up after yourself too! Why am I a fan of these places? because they keep the costs low. Most dishes are $10 or less!Whether easy or picky eaters, everyone has the freedom to choose whatever combo they want. You choose your base (noodle or rice), add your sauce (laksa, peanut sauce, hoisin, etc) add your meat. Then you can say if you just want it plain stir fry or in a soup. You can get your pho fix here too!I wasn't absurdly hungry so I ordered a bunch of appetizers for myself and for the table: chicken satay ($6), fried croquettes ($5), tofu salad ($4) coconut shrimp ($6).  Everything was cooked just right and had delicious accompanying sauces. Yum.Thanks Toss for keeping our family lunch affordable and fun! There was definitely a choice for everyone."
631,"When I first walked through the doors of Toss, there was a strange odor, almost like wet dog smell. I knew I wasn't alone, because the person I was with, who also happened to be the one who suggested Toss to me, also smelled it. The smell did not last long, it's just not what I was expecting from a restaurant. The menu is very simple. You pick what type of noodles you want (rice also available), then you choose the sauce you want it tossed in, and finally you choose your meat option. I went with wheat noodles, Thai sauce, and chicken. The food came out very quick. The wheat noodles are skinny noodles, which I prefer because it's easier to eat, in my opinion. I love the fresh veggies they use, and the Thai sauce was awesome. We also shared a plate of garlic edamame. The garlic were nice sized pieces, and fresh. The edamame is tossed in soy sauce, which adds another welcome flavor element. The restaurant has a nice, chill vibe to it. They havr a water station, where you can pour your own water, and the water itself is spa water (cucumber slices in it). In the end, they serve great food at a great price."
632,"We were looking for soup on a Thursday night. We couldn't believe how difficult it was to find soup or even a restaurant that's open past 8:30 pm.  This place was perfect. We created a bowl of soup - hokkien noodles, clear soup, and chicken. The waitress brought it to our table; nice and hot with good flavor.  Everything we saw being delivered to customers looked good. There's so many choices in designing your own meal. Stop in and try one; you won't be disappointed."
633,"I really do enjoy the noodles at this restaurant but I'm giving this review only 2 stars because the portion sizes at Toss is very disappointing. I started coming here a couple of years ago and every single time I come, the amount of noodles that actually go into my bowl heavily decreases. Noodles are pretty cheap, I could literally buy 3 noodle plates in Chinatown for less than $15. BUT I'm paying around $10-$13 at Toss for a bowl of noodles that barely reach the middle of my bowl. The last and final time I came here, I ordered the hokkien noodles with Thai sauce and beef, when the lady brought out my noodles, I could literally see the bottom of the bowl... THATS HOW LITTLE NOODLES I GOT! Are you serious Toss? I'm not blind. I had to go up to the cashier and let her know how disappointed I was before a new bowl was brought out to me. Overall, the noodles here are good, but since it seems like a ten dollar bill gets me less than half a bowl of noodles, I'll go spend my money at Imm Thai instead."
634,"I've come here a few times and now and ordered something different each time and have yet to be disappointed! You choose your base first: noodle, rice, or fried rice. There are 5 types of noodles and the option for white or brown rice. Then you pick the flavour you want. There are 5 different stir fry flavours as well as the option to get curry! Finally you pick a protein - tofu is the only vegetarian option and there's also plenty of meat options.I've had curry, fried rice, and noodles and they've all been great! Portion size is good and all the dishes come with plenty of veggies and egg as well. The tofu has also always been well cooked unlike some places where I've experienced semi raw chunks of tofu thrown in. Overall, I love the variety and consistency of their food and I can't wait to try more combos in the future!"
635,"Won't stop until I've tried every single noodle/rice/sauce/meat combination!Toss is seriously SOOOOO bae!  It's a fun process or ordering because you get to pick your own noodles or rice, sauce and meat.  You make exactly what you want to eat and it's all very good quality!There's not much of a customer service aspect here because you order at the counter and then just wait for your food to be brought to you at the table.  I like that there are big pitchers of water for customers though so we can keep one at the table.  I can't stand not having enough beverage with my meal!Toss has the traditional thai restaurant sauces with the chili, jalepenos, etc. but they have one that's a smooth consistency and spicy and it is HEAVEN!!!  If you like spice, DEFINITELY use this to spice up your dishPros: you get to order exactly what you want every time.  There are so many combinations of orders to get here and they're all equally good.cons: people who haven't been tend to order as if they've never heard of food before and might take a while if they're not used to the ordering process here, so beware.  TIP! if you order curry with noodles, I like to ask them to put them together so I don't have to mix in the noodles with the sauce myself.  It lets the noodles absorb more curry sauce.  It's SO good!Toss is definitely a fun place to come with friends for a fun dinner with delicious food and great atmosphere!  The staff is friendly and they make DELICIOUS food that will always leave you wanting to come back again!"
636,"Thai-Hokkien-beef YASS! My go-to noodle bar whenever I'm back in NorCal! You honestly can't go wrong with any combo here. Everything is delicious --even the Tom yum is up to par with my standards. Coconut prawns were also pretty tasty, but nothing to get super hyped about"
637,"Filling noodle dishes for good prices. Toss Noodle Bar made the order process simple: choose one of four different noodles, your meat/tofu, and your sauce. I personally liked the Hokkein noodles with shrimp and peanut sauce. Was quite delicious! Although the restaurant was packed the food came out quick. You gotta clean up after yourself but I'm happily doing so as the noodles were great and the prices aiiiiiright!"
638,"I've come several times in the past and ended up staring at a bunch of flies zooming around the restaurant entrance.  Pretty unappetizing for me...For some reason, a lot of my friends want to come here for dinner so I've been way more times than I would've chosen to.   You can choose your noodles/rice, protein, and sauce (or make it a soup).  The meal comes out to around $10, which is pretty decent.  My favorite combo has to be the the Hokkien noodle with chicken and peanut sauce.  Don't get me wrong.  The food is good.  I just don't really get the hype.  There's generally always a place for you to sit after ordering at the register.  There's cute mason jars for your water needs."
639,"I  usually am a man with the determination to finish any meal I get at restaurants, but when it comes to Toss Noodle Bar's bowls, they are so generous that I can't finish them; however, it's great because that means I can get some of that deliciousness for leftovers. Truly large portions with delicious soups like their sour and spicy tomyum.Honestly, do not come here for anything but the noodles. The curry or stir fry portions are not so filling and they cost as much as the soups because they charge based on the meat, so go for the bowls!Biggest plus is that they do not kick you out for bringing in outside drinks for example. Come here a lot with friends out of random bursts of cravings and I've come in with coffee or boba and they do not have a problem with that, which is great!"
640,"I love them nooDZ NOODZ nOODZ, noodz i do adooreeseriously this place is amazeballs. I love that you can customize your entire order. I was so excited coming in here because I saw the different variations you can do, as well as the other yummy appetizers they had on the menu! I got the spinach noodles with half malay(peanut) and half thai(spicy) with chicken as my protein. I like that the stir fry option already comes with lots of vegetables and egg. The two sauces combined gave it a nice creamy texture. The thai spicy sauce wasnt spicy at all! The noodles were cooked perfectlyThe bf got the thin rice tom yum soup with chicken. I didnt get to try a lot of it, but the soup was tom yum soup was yummmyyWe also got the TOSS beef salad. I was kinda dejected because I saw a picture of it on the yelp page and it looked really good, like a steak salad. But when it came out, it was more like a vietnamese lemongrass beef salad instead. I really wanted to try their croquette and samosas but when I got there, they didn't have it on their menu! I was kinda disappointed.Anyways it was self serve after they bring you your food. They had cute mason jars for you to fill up at the water station and a bucket to put your dirty bowls. I only noticed this after but if you look at the TOSS symbol, you can notice that the T and O make a wok and the S S are noodles! This is a cheap and easy meal. Parking sucks because it's so crowded and in downtown"
641,"A decent place to grab a quick dinner downtown, and cheaper than most places downtown.It's a build you own noodle/rice bowl, where you select you noodle/rice type, protein, and sauce. I really like the hokkien and spinach noodles (they maintain a good chew), usually with chicken and the Chinese or Japanese sauce. The portions are ok, you don't get a lot of the protein for what you pay, but it's tasty and again, it's much cheaper than most other places downtown. I've also tried their curry, which is alright- I'd still probably go somewhere that's just Thai food like Racha or Thai noodle for curry, but the curry here isn't bad. The restaurant itself is pretty cute, with a good range of tables for small to large groups (you order then seat yourself). One weird thing about it is that there's always flies hovering around the door? Nothing major and they're not inside the restaurant but it isn't the most pleasant experience walking into the restaurant."
642,"This place is an upscale fast food restaurant basically. The service is quick but the food is just alright. Definitely can be a quick fix for comfort food for those Asian college students who miss their parents cooking. You basically have control of what you put in your bowl. There are three options: rice, noodles, or fried rice. From there, you then choose your sauces, veggies, and/or meat. I got the soup with glass noodle, Tom Yum base, and beef. Tasted okay. The soup wasn't as strong like other Thai places and I would have also been okay with not finishing my meal. After you order, it's mostly self service. There's water on the side of the restaurant with cute Mason jars. However this establishment is quite small so I would not recommend large parties."
643,"Noodles for everyone! Toss is a great place to go when you can't decide what type of asian flavor, you particularly want. It's great for a group of people who just can't decide on one type of asian food. Hidden next to UA Berkeley Theaters, Toss is a casual asian fusion restaurant where you are able to combine different noodles, sauces, and meats. I've been to this place throughout my years at Berkeley and it never fails to satisfy my hunger for asian noodles. I usually get the hokkien noodles, which is a thick yellow egg noodles that absorbs the sauce you choose. I've tried most of the sauces but the best one would have to be the Malay peanut sauce. It adds a hearty peanut flavor to the noodles that I haven't seen anywhere else. If you aren't in the mood for any of the sauces the Laska, which is a curry coconut soup is perfect for a cold day. Make sure to ask for spicy or add your own spices, since it usually comes out bland without it. There is also rice dishes, but they never seem to be worth getting. The only complaint I have is that the sauces lack a depth of flavors like restaurants that focus on only one or two noodle dishes. However, for only $10 dollars, Toss has good portions sizes that is good for lunch and dinner!"
644,"Affordable, good place by campus for food. Choose your own noodles, sauce, veggies, meat, etc and they'll make it for you. Portion sizes are good, but nothing's amazing since you have the risk of putting not so great things together. Protip: get what you think you'll like."

664,"Affordable, good place by campus for food. Choose your own noodles, sauce, veggies, meat, etc and they'll make it for you. Portion sizes are good, but nothing's amazing since you have the risk of putting not so great things together. Protip: get what you think you'll like."
665,This is your quick fast casual for noodles. You get to choose the type of noodles sauce and protein I got the hokkien noodles with Thai and Malay with chicken. It came out super quickly and each dish comes in a big bowl. It also comes with a bunch of different vegetables in the dish. It tasted slightly sweet but a little spicy but not too much. I wanted to get extra chili to spice it up! The noodles were stir fry quickly and I can see the wok hey markings on the noodles. It's around $10/$11 for each so it's a quick bite to eat. Just walk in and go directly to the counter. The waiter will give you a number and bring the food to you. Parking is rough in the area. I usually park near YMCA or the park a couple blocks away and walk here. Grab some noodles and walk it off in downtown Berkeley!
666,"Toss Noddle Bar is probably my favorite noodle place in all of Berkeley, and I don't know why I didn't go here since freshman year. TO be honest, I don't even remember what I ordered since I came a while back ago, but all I can tell you is that there isn't anything that can go wrong.Think of it as a subway, for noodles. haha, it's so customizable, and they even let you combine spaces which was pretty neat! This place isn't really great for large groups, which can be a downfall, but groups of 4 are perfect."
667,"I found this little gem while browsing in the search section on Yelp and have been coming back ever since.It is soooooo freaking good OMG. It's a design your own but they do have pre-set items that go in it. For instance, it comes with noodles but you get to pick which style you want. I always get hokkien noodles. They are thick like chow mein for those that are unfamiliar with the names. It comes with meat but you get to choose which one or two you want. Typically I get chicken but I have tried the combo and got chicken and prawn. The prawn wasn't cooked all the way : ( you pick your sauce of choice, I always get the Thai sauce. It's spicey. All noodle options come with veggies.For less than $10 and very filling. Yes! You can't beat that. I gave 4 stars just for the half cooked prawn. It happened both times I ordered the combo so I cannot even say it was an accident the first time. If I had known the shrimp would still be see through i wouldn't have ordered the combo. I ordered it a second time thinking maybe the first time it was an accident, so I tried again. Whomp, same issue. Some people may like it like that, but nah, if I wanted a shrimp cocktail I went somewhere that had that on the menu."
668,"The prices are reasonable and the food is tasty but the place is a little dirty and there are usually some flies around the restaurant. Water is self serve and you're supposed to bring your dishes to the their dish tray when you're done.I ordered the hokkaido noodles with Thai sauce and beef and the portions were fairly large. Overall, it is a pretty good place for a quick and tasty bite that won't break the bank."
669,"Alongside the busy strip of Shattuck Avenue lies a somewhat hidden Toss Noodle Bar where one can customize their noodles to their liking.I've tried this place a couple times now and I find the concept to be quite interesting. All in all, it's similar to Pieology and Chipotle, but for noodles. Choose your meats, sauce, type of noodles, and etc. based on your own preferences and they'll make it for you. I've tried various combinations and for the price, I did enjoy what I got though I found that no matter what I chose the enjoyment per bite depreciated very quickly. I feel that Toss is special in it's wide variety of possible combinations, but in that variety, there is a lack of specialization and passion for the food it serves due to it's concept of personal customization. Overall, I would say it's a fun experience to try, but for a good noodle dish, I would prefer a location where the chef understands the flavors and combinations that work to make a fulfilling mix of flavors with personality."
670,"Our family got caught in the pouring rain but thank goodness for Toss Noodle Bar!This eatery serves up noodle dishes, soups and rice bowls in a casual setting. Order up at the counter, pay and grab your own utensils and water. You clean up after yourself too! Why am I a fan of these places? because they keep the costs low. Most dishes are $10 or less!Whether easy or picky eaters, everyone has the freedom to choose whatever combo they want. You choose your base (noodle or rice), add your sauce (laksa, peanut sauce, hoisin, etc) add your meat. Then you can say if you just want it plain stir fry or in a soup. You can get your pho fix here too!I wasn't absurdly hungry so I ordered a bunch of appetizers for myself and for the table: chicken satay ($6), fried croquettes ($5), tofu salad ($4) coconut shrimp ($6).  Everything was cooked just right and had delicious accompanying sauces. Yum.Thanks Toss for keeping our family lunch affordable and fun! There was definitely a choice for everyone."
671,"When I first walked through the doors of Toss, there was a strange odor, almost like wet dog smell. I knew I wasn't alone, because the person I was with, who also happened to be the one who suggested Toss to me, also smelled it. The smell did not last long, it's just not what I was expecting from a restaurant. The menu is very simple. You pick what type of noodles you want (rice also available), then you choose the sauce you want it tossed in, and finally you choose your meat option. I went with wheat noodles, Thai sauce, and chicken. The food came out very quick. The wheat noodles are skinny noodles, which I prefer because it's easier to eat, in my opinion. I love the fresh veggies they use, and the Thai sauce was awesome. We also shared a plate of garlic edamame. The garlic were nice sized pieces, and fresh. The edamame is tossed in soy sauce, which adds another welcome flavor element. The restaurant has a nice, chill vibe to it. They havr a water station, where you can pour your own water, and the water itself is spa water (cucumber slices in it). In the end, they serve great food at a great price."
672,"We were looking for soup on a Thursday night. We couldn't believe how difficult it was to find soup or even a restaurant that's open past 8:30 pm.  This place was perfect. We created a bowl of soup - hokkien noodles, clear soup, and chicken. The waitress brought it to our table; nice and hot with good flavor.  Everything we saw being delivered to customers looked good. There's so many choices in designing your own meal. Stop in and try one; you won't be disappointed."
673,"I really do enjoy the noodles at this restaurant but I'm giving this review only 2 stars because the portion sizes at Toss is very disappointing. I started coming here a couple of years ago and every single time I come, the amount of noodles that actually go into my bowl heavily decreases. Noodles are pretty cheap, I could literally buy 3 noodle plates in Chinatown for less than $15. BUT I'm paying around $10-$13 at Toss for a bowl of noodles that barely reach the middle of my bowl. The last and final time I came here, I ordered the hokkien noodles with Thai sauce and beef, when the lady brought out my noodles, I could literally see the bottom of the bowl... THATS HOW LITTLE NOODLES I GOT! Are you serious Toss? I'm not blind. I had to go up to the cashier and let her know how disappointed I was before a new bowl was brought out to me. Overall, the noodles here are good, but since it seems like a ten dollar bill gets me less than half a bowl of noodles, I'll go spend my money at Imm Thai instead."
674,"I've come here a few times and now and ordered something different each time and have yet to be disappointed! You choose your base first: noodle, rice, or fried rice. There are 5 types of noodles and the option for white or brown rice. Then you pick the flavour you want. There are 5 different stir fry flavours as well as the option to get curry! Finally you pick a protein - tofu is the only vegetarian option and there's also plenty of meat options.I've had curry, fried rice, and noodles and they've all been great! Portion size is good and all the dishes come with plenty of veggies and egg as well. The tofu has also always been well cooked unlike some places where I've experienced semi raw chunks of tofu thrown in. Overall, I love the variety and consistency of their food and I can't wait to try more combos in the future!"
675,"Won't stop until I've tried every single noodle/rice/sauce/meat combination!Toss is seriously SOOOOO bae!  It's a fun process or ordering because you get to pick your own noodles or rice, sauce and meat.  You make exactly what you want to eat and it's all very good quality!There's not much of a customer service aspect here because you order at the counter and then just wait for your food to be brought to you at the table.  I like that there are big pitchers of water for customers though so we can keep one at the table.  I can't stand not having enough beverage with my meal!Toss has the traditional thai restaurant sauces with the chili, jalepenos, etc. but they have one that's a smooth consistency and spicy and it is HEAVEN!!!  If you like spice, DEFINITELY use this to spice up your dishPros: you get to order exactly what you want every time.  There are so many combinations of orders to get here and they're all equally good.cons: people who haven't been tend to order as if they've never heard of food before and might take a while if they're not used to the ordering process here, so beware.  TIP! if you order curry with noodles, I like to ask them to put them together so I don't have to mix in the noodles with the sauce myself.  It lets the noodles absorb more curry sauce.  It's SO good!Toss is definitely a fun place to come with friends for a fun dinner with delicious food and great atmosphere!  The staff is friendly and they make DELICIOUS food that will always leave you wanting to come back again!"
676,"Thai-Hokkien-beef YASS! My go-to noodle bar whenever I'm back in NorCal! You honestly can't go wrong with any combo here. Everything is delicious --even the Tom yum is up to par with my standards. Coconut prawns were also pretty tasty, but nothing to get super hyped about"
677,"Filling noodle dishes for good prices. Toss Noodle Bar made the order process simple: choose one of four different noodles, your meat/tofu, and your sauce. I personally liked the Hokkein noodles with shrimp and peanut sauce. Was quite delicious! Although the restaurant was packed the food came out quick. You gotta clean up after yourself but I'm happily doing so as the noodles were great and the prices aiiiiiright!"
678,"I've come several times in the past and ended up staring at a bunch of flies zooming around the restaurant entrance.  Pretty unappetizing for me...For some reason, a lot of my friends want to come here for dinner so I've been way more times than I would've chosen to.   You can choose your noodles/rice, protein, and sauce (or make it a soup).  The meal comes out to around $10, which is pretty decent.  My favorite combo has to be the the Hokkien noodle with chicken and peanut sauce.  Don't get me wrong.  The food is good.  I just don't really get the hype.  There's generally always a place for you to sit after ordering at the register.  There's cute mason jars for your water needs."
679,"I  usually am a man with the determination to finish any meal I get at restaurants, but when it comes to Toss Noodle Bar's bowls, they are so generous that I can't finish them; however, it's great because that means I can get some of that deliciousness for leftovers. Truly large portions with delicious soups like their sour and spicy tomyum.Honestly, do not come here for anything but the noodles. The curry or stir fry portions are not so filling and they cost as much as the soups because they charge based on the meat, so go for the bowls!Biggest plus is that they do not kick you out for bringing in outside drinks for example. Come here a lot with friends out of random bursts of cravings and I've come in with coffee or boba and they do not have a problem with that, which is great!"
680,"I love them nooDZ NOODZ nOODZ, noodz i do adooreeseriously this place is amazeballs. I love that you can customize your entire order. I was so excited coming in here because I saw the different variations you can do, as well as the other yummy appetizers they had on the menu! I got the spinach noodles with half malay(peanut) and half thai(spicy) with chicken as my protein. I like that the stir fry option already comes with lots of vegetables and egg. The two sauces combined gave it a nice creamy texture. The thai spicy sauce wasnt spicy at all! The noodles were cooked perfectlyThe bf got the thin rice tom yum soup with chicken. I didnt get to try a lot of it, but the soup was tom yum soup was yummmyyWe also got the TOSS beef salad. I was kinda dejected because I saw a picture of it on the yelp page and it looked really good, like a steak salad. But when it came out, it was more like a vietnamese lemongrass beef salad instead. I really wanted to try their croquette and samosas but when I got there, they didn't have it on their menu! I was kinda disappointed.Anyways it was self serve after they bring you your food. They had cute mason jars for you to fill up at the water station and a bucket to put your dirty bowls. I only noticed this after but if you look at the TOSS symbol, you can notice that the T and O make a wok and the S S are noodles! This is a cheap and easy meal. Parking sucks because it's so crowded and in downtown"
681,"A decent place to grab a quick dinner downtown, and cheaper than most places downtown.It's a build you own noodle/rice bowl, where you select you noodle/rice type, protein, and sauce. I really like the hokkien and spinach noodles (they maintain a good chew), usually with chicken and the Chinese or Japanese sauce. The portions are ok, you don't get a lot of the protein for what you pay, but it's tasty and again, it's much cheaper than most other places downtown. I've also tried their curry, which is alright- I'd still probably go somewhere that's just Thai food like Racha or Thai noodle for curry, but the curry here isn't bad. The restaurant itself is pretty cute, with a good range of tables for small to large groups (you order then seat yourself). One weird thing about it is that there's always flies hovering around the door? Nothing major and they're not inside the restaurant but it isn't the most pleasant experience walking into the restaurant."
682,"This place is an upscale fast food restaurant basically. The service is quick but the food is just alright. Definitely can be a quick fix for comfort food for those Asian college students who miss their parents cooking. You basically have control of what you put in your bowl. There are three options: rice, noodles, or fried rice. From there, you then choose your sauces, veggies, and/or meat. I got the soup with glass noodle, Tom Yum base, and beef. Tasted okay. The soup wasn't as strong like other Thai places and I would have also been okay with not finishing my meal. After you order, it's mostly self service. There's water on the side of the restaurant with cute Mason jars. However this establishment is quite small so I would not recommend large parties."
683,"Noodles for everyone! Toss is a great place to go when you can't decide what type of asian flavor, you particularly want. It's great for a group of people who just can't decide on one type of asian food. Hidden next to UA Berkeley Theaters, Toss is a casual asian fusion restaurant where you are able to combine different noodles, sauces, and meats. I've been to this place throughout my years at Berkeley and it never fails to satisfy my hunger for asian noodles. I usually get the hokkien noodles, which is a thick yellow egg noodles that absorbs the sauce you choose. I've tried most of the sauces but the best one would have to be the Malay peanut sauce. It adds a hearty peanut flavor to the noodles that I haven't seen anywhere else. If you aren't in the mood for any of the sauces the Laska, which is a curry coconut soup is perfect for a cold day. Make sure to ask for spicy or add your own spices, since it usually comes out bland without it. There is also rice dishes, but they never seem to be worth getting. The only complaint I have is that the sauces lack a depth of flavors like restaurants that focus on only one or two noodle dishes. However, for only $10 dollars, Toss has good portions sizes that is good for lunch and dinner!"
