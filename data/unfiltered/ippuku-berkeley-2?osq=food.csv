0,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
1,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
2,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
3,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
4,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
5,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
6,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
7,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
8,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
9,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
10,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
11,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
12,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
13,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
14,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
15,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
16,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
17,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
18,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
19,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."

Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
27,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
28,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
29,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
30,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
31,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
32,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
33,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
34,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
35,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
36,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
37,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
38,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
39,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
40,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
41,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
42,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
43,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
44,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
45,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
46,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls.

59,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
60,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
61,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
62,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
63,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
64,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
65,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
66,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
67,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
68,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
69,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
70,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
71,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
72,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
73,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
74,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
75,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
76,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
77,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
78,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef.

86,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
87,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
88,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
89,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
90,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
91,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
92,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
93,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
94,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
95,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
96,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
97,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
98,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
99,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
100,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
101,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
102,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
103,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
104,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
105,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."

A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
117,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
118,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
119,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
120,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
121,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
122,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
123,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
124,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
125,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
126,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
127,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
128,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
129,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
130,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
131,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
132,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
133,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
134,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
135,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"

When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
146,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
147,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
148,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
149,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
150,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
151,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
152,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
153,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
154,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
155,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
156,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
157,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
158,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
159,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
160,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
161,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
162,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
163,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
164,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
165,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are.

But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
174,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
175,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
176,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
177,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
178,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
179,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
180,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
181,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
182,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
183,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
184,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
185,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
186,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
187,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
188,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
189,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
190,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
191,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
192,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
193,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great.

204,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
205,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
206,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
207,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
208,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
209,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
210,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
211,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
212,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
213,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
214,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
215,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
216,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
217,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
218,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
219,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
220,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
221,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
222,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
223,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive.

Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
233,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
234,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
235,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
236,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
237,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
238,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
239,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
240,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
241,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
242,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
243,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
244,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
245,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
246,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
247,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
248,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
249,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
250,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
251,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"

I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
264,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
265,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
266,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
267,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
268,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
269,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
270,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
271,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
272,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
273,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
274,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
275,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
276,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
277,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
278,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
279,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
280,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
281,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
282,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
283,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret.

Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
291,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
292,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
293,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
294,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
295,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
296,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
297,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
298,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
299,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
300,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
301,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
302,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
303,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
304,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
305,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
306,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
307,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
308,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
309,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"

Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
323,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
324,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
325,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
326,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
327,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
328,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
329,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
330,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
331,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
332,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
333,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
334,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
335,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
336,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
337,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
338,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
339,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
340,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
341,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
342,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area.

Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
350,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
351,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
352,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
353,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
354,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
355,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
356,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
357,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
358,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
359,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
360,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
361,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
362,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
363,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
364,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
365,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
366,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
367,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
368,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."

There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
381,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
382,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
383,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
384,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
385,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
386,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
387,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
388,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
389,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
390,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
391,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
392,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
393,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
394,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
395,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
396,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
397,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
398,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
399,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
400,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous!

The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
408,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
409,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
410,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
411,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
412,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
413,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
414,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
415,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
416,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
417,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
418,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
419,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
420,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
421,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
422,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
423,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
424,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
425,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
426,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"

We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
441,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
442,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
443,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
444,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
445,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
446,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
447,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
448,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
449,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
450,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
451,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
452,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
453,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
454,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
455,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
456,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
457,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
458,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
459,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."

Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
467,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
468,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
469,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
470,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
471,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
472,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
473,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
474,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
475,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
476,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
477,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
478,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
479,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
480,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
481,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
482,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
483,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
484,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
485,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
486,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing.

They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
499,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
500,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
501,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
502,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
503,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
504,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
505,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
506,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
507,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
508,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
509,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
510,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
511,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
512,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
513,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
514,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
515,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
516,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
517,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."

There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
526,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
527,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
528,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
529,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
530,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
531,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
532,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
533,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
534,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
535,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
536,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
537,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
538,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
539,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
540,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
541,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
542,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
543,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
544,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
545,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point.

In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
556,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
557,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
558,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
559,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
560,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
561,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
562,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
563,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
564,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
565,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
566,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
567,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
568,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
569,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
570,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
571,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
572,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
573,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
574,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"

585,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
586,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
587,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
588,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
589,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
590,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
591,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
592,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
593,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
594,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
595,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
596,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
597,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
598,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
599,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
600,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
601,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
602,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
603,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
604,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"

Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
613,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
614,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
615,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
616,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
617,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
618,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
619,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
620,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
621,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
622,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
623,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
624,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
625,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
626,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
627,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
628,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
629,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
630,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
631,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
632,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer.....

Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
644,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
645,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
646,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
647,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
648,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
649,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
650,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
651,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
652,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
653,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
654,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
655,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
656,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
657,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
658,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
659,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
660,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
661,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
662,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
663,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad.

671,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
672,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
673,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
674,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
675,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
676,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
677,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
678,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
679,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
680,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
681,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
682,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
683,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
684,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
685,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
686,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
687,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
688,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
689,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"

What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
703,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
704,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
705,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
706,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
707,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
708,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
709,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
710,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
711,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
712,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
713,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
714,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
715,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
716,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
717,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
718,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
719,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
720,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
721,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
722,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think?

This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
730,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
731,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
732,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
733,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
734,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
735,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
736,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
737,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
738,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
739,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
740,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
741,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
742,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
743,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
744,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
745,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
746,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
747,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
748,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."

There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
761,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
762,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
763,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
764,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
765,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
766,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
767,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
768,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
769,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
770,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
771,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
772,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
773,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
774,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
775,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
776,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
777,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
778,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
779,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
780,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous!

The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
788,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
789,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
790,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
791,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
792,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
793,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
794,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
795,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
796,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
797,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
798,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
799,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
800,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
801,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
802,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
803,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
804,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
805,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
806,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"

We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
821,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
822,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
823,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
824,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
825,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
826,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
827,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
828,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
829,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
830,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
831,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
832,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
833,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
834,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
835,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
836,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
837,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
838,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
839,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."

Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
847,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
848,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
849,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
850,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
851,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
852,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
853,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
854,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
855,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
856,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
857,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
858,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
859,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
860,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
861,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
862,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
863,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
864,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
865,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
866,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing.

They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
879,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
880,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
881,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
882,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
883,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
884,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
885,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
886,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
887,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
888,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
889,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
890,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
891,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
892,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
893,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
894,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
895,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
896,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"

There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
906,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
907,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
908,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
909,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
910,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
911,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
912,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
913,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
914,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
915,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
916,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
917,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
918,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
919,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
920,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
921,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
922,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
923,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
924,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
925,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point.

In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
936,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
937,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
938,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
939,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
940,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
941,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
942,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
943,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
944,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
945,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
946,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
947,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
948,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
949,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
950,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
951,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
952,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
953,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
954,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"

965,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
966,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
967,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
968,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
969,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
970,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
971,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
972,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
973,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
974,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
975,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
976,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
977,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
978,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
979,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
980,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
981,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
982,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
983,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
984,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"

Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
993,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
994,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
995,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
996,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
997,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
998,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
999,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
1000,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
1001,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
1002,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
1003,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error. It was not until the squid came out that we were like ummmm what the heck? No ""sumimasen"" from the server. Apparently, this was our fault?The squid was good, but the sauce was a bit sad. Japanese MSG mayo and some grated daikon.  I think a little yuku kusho might have been better? When the chicken skewers finally came out, the server explained briskly what cut of chicken each skewer was. I honestly could not understand her EngRish. This was probably why the order was not inputted in the first place. The wings and gizzard were obvious, but the other cuts were a mystery. Again, Ippuku undercooks their chicken on purpose so be prepared for a rubbery skewer. By this point, we just wanted to GTFO.Maybe in the Bay Area this is a 4-star place, but compared to other izakayas that I've been to, this place is overrated and the portions are really small. Don't get me wrong, Ippuku shouldn't commit seppuku (ritual suicide) or anything because to a Berkeley student it must be some awesome exotic stuff. However, to me, it was unimpressive. Seriously, went next door for pizza and beer to satiate my hAnger."
1004,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
1005,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
1006,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
1007,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
1008,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
1009,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
1010,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
1011,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"

Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer.....

1024,"Still popular and still going strong after 1,035 reviews, Ippuku is a hopping izakaya in downtown Berkeley that offers a sophisticated atmosphere, complete with booths that are partially screened off from foot traffic, as well as rooms where everyone sits cross-legged around a communal table. There's a good variety of offerings here, and I like the fact that things aren't priced or portioned excessively. This way you can try lots of dishes to get a sense of what the place is capable of. Skewers like the chicken breast and chicken thigh with leek, for example, are quite solid, while savory items like the bacon-wrapped mochi and the seared camembert with honey are sinfully satisfying. Heftier dishes like the Berkshire pork belly will fill you up despite their outwardly diminutive appearance.It may take an eternity to get in, but you can grab a drink and some bites at the bar, which has both an indoor and heated outdoor component, before getting a table inside. Service is also reasonably fast and efficient. Highly recommended!"
1025,"I thought that going to Japan would ruin me for Japanese food in America. And I'm not sure I was way off base in thinking that. However what it really has done is make me appreciate the little, legit corners of Japanese fare happening in some out-of-the-way spots like Ippuku for what they are. I won't use the A-word here (what does it even mean anyway), but on many levels this joint could be any given izakaya in any given Tokyo neighborhood. Ippuku follows a traditional yakitori/izakaya blueprint. There's an extensive sake and shochu menu, all available by glass or carafe. When I say extensive, I mean I've never seen this much shochu in one place outside of Japan. There's also awamori and other more niche japanese spirits. While the actual bar itself is very small, the focus here is on drinking and eating - which is par for the course in Japan. It's neither bar-first nor restaurant-first... it's a marriage of the two. The food here is focused heavily on skewers and small hot plates that come from the grill in the back (which also has a small chef's counter). Many chicken skewer options including skin, heart, neck, kneecaps, thigh oyster, cartilage, and other traditional parts. They also have beef tongue, A5 wagyu, mochi nori, scallion pancake, crab croquette, and a long list of small plates. Everything we sampled from this part of the menu was on point, especially the maitake mushroom tempura (best mushroom tempura I've ever had). There's also a finisher section of the menu with soups and noodles, including a chicken udon that at first blush is plain, but upon inspection is anything but. Simple is the best word. Simple, straightforward, deeeeep chicken broth, pulled chicken meat, and udon noodles. Pretty incredible stuff all around. Service is friendly and on point. There are booths, tables behind screens, tatami-style (shoes-off) tables, chef's counter and a few bar seats. The place gets busy but it does take reservations, and I was able to get one a day in advance. It's about a block from a BART station so it's easy access. This place blew my mind from all angles. As mentioned at the outset, I have yet to find an Izakaya in the states that even remotely mirrors the experience you'd find in Japan, and this is by far and away the closest."
1026,"If you plan on visiting Ippuku you should not come with the expectation of leaving full unless you have the money to fork over for the amount of dishes it would likely take to fill you up. It all depends on how big your appetite is! Even with that being said, I came for dinner with a party of four and still left with a bill (before adding addt'l tip) to roughly around $120. One of my friends made the reservation via phone. Upon first walking into Ippuku, I noticeably was drawn in by the dimmed lighting and wooden fixtures. Plus, bonus points for feeling the warmth/heat as you entered the restaurant saving us from the winter chills. There was booth seating, seating for two people - these seats had smaller tables, but looked quite intimate and was unique in my personal opinion, and also had (towards the right side seats for larger parties where you sat on the floor and had to take off your shoes! I also noticed there was a VIP room, ooooh ahhhh! For drinks we ordered hot sake for the table. Before we placed our order they also gave us a small bowl of cabbage-like salad along with what I believe to be a mayonnaise based dressing. Food-wise we ordered bacon wrapped mochi, pork belly, beef tongue, gyozas, quail eggs, crab croquettes, and grilled rice balls. Unless otherwise specified, you typically received two of each dish listed on the menu. Overall, my favorite dish of the night had to be the pork belly! Something about the fatty deliciousness of pork I can't explain! The beef tongue was good as well, though admittingly chewier than I am accustomed. We added some chili flakes and this really helped added some oomph to it! The bacon mochi was also good and worth trying, but my friends and I seemed to enjoy the mochi's texture moreso than having it wrapped in bacon. While the other food we ordered were good, they weren't anything I would run home to my mama about. For example, the quail eggs were literally quail eggs on skewers and the grilled rice balls tasted as described but with the added soy sauce flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Ippuku! The atmosphere combined with the yakitori really helped to add to the authenticity and quality of the meal. I would come back, but likely would eat a bit before coming to keep my bill budget friendly, but by all means if you're down to go for the gold (aka spend all da cash monies) come here ready to chomp chomp chomp away! The booths and atmosphere also if you want to take note, prob would make for a great date option especially if they really love yakitori!"
1027,"One of the best Japanese places I've been to in the Bay Area. They have a great range of yakitori. The wagyu beef was just amazing but the chicken meatballs and thigh also stood out. The space was also well done, feels like you walked into a small corner of Japan. I will say the service is really slow so don't expect attentive service. If you're ok to chill this place is definitely worth a try!"
1028,"TLDR: Great Atmosphere average food.Came here for valentine's day expecting a huge wait but we were seated immediately.The food was kind of tapas style so we ordered quite a few things.Skewer Omakase: Didn't try this because it was all meatCrab Croquettes: Ok, It was a little more creamy and less crispy than I expected/hoped. It came with a huge bed of shredded greens that paired really well with the croquettes. Ramen: Not bad, the noodles were more reminiscent of Hong Kong Wonton noodles than ramen though.Hamachi: Pretty standard, raw fish covered in sauce. A little bit sweet for my taste. I was disappointed because they said the fish was flown fresh just the other night but the sauce covered any of potential fresh taste.Salted Mackerel: Not bad, a little bit salty for my taste. Squid Ink Rice: My favorite, this was great and was exactly what I was craving. Should have just ordered four of these.Overall, if it's Izakayas, Kiraku is way better in terms of taste and pricing and it's nearby."
1029,"So fun! This spot is def that fun, Japanese experience. I wouldn't say you are coming for amazing food or service, because I didn't find that here, but I'd say you're coming for a fun night out with some solid eats! Make a reservation or you will be waiting!If you are starving, you will spend a ton of dough. I'd come as if you're coming for some Japanese tapas and beers. This spot is that itzakaya style spot you'd find in Japan, that's focused around drinking with some nibbles to enjoy with said drinks.The plentiful shochu drinks are strong! The beers come in large glasses. SCORE!We all agreed: the actual yakitori was disappointing. We didn't go with any crazy options like gizzard or chicken heart, but the thigh and the breast, although juicy and well cooked wasn't seasoned or tasty. The other foods were more delicious: crab croquette, rice balls, the squid ink rice (not super salty at all), the gyoza (so much juicy chicken inside) and so on. They do have some larger dishes as well that we didn't opt for: chicken soup with rice ball and ramen.The tables are some isolated booths and large tables (where ya take your shoes off -- so Japan!).Our party of four didn't leave stuffed, but we didn't leave hungry. We had some nibbles and not a ton to drink and it was still about $40/per person with tip.Overall, come for the experience with friends and you're in for a good night of drinks, laughs and solid eats. Don't come exclusively for mind blowing food! :)"
1030,"If you experiment with food or love yakitori, this place is a must!I was visiting SF area and I had an opportunity to reconnect with a local who is a friend. I would never have found this place myself nor realized how great it was without him.Food: hearts, liver, black ink, squid, mochi with bacon). Yum! Decor: love the wood and cubes for seating that create the illusion of privacy"
1031,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
1032,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
1033,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
1034,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
1035,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
1036,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
1037,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
1038,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
1039,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
1040,"Ippuku is a cool Japanese izakaya and yakitori restaurant in Berkeley. The first time I was here was for an anniversary celebration. We had a reservation and got seated at a table that was rather private. We were also a little disappointed to hear that when we arrived, they ran out of some items, like the raw chicken dish and some of the chicken skewers (skin and heart I remember specifically hoping to try). Though there were still a lot for us to try!+BACON WRAPPED MOCHI: Love this texture! Fatty bacon wrapped around chewy mochi balls on a stick. +BEEF TONGUE: Salted and great texture! Great if you like beef tongue or are willing to try it!+LARGE HOKKAIDO SQUID: This is a great size to share and it's not too chewy! Quite delicious!+MINCED CHICKEN W/ YOKE: This minced meatball on a stick comes with a yolk! Don't be scared because it's quite tasty. We broke the yolk and dipped the meatball into it!+CHICKEN TAIL: This was recommended by our waitress and we thoroughly enjoyed this! It was a juicy piece of chicken!+KNEE CARTILAGE: A little crunchy and actually really delicious! Would recommend trying if you're feeling adventurous.-THIGH OYSTER: This was juicy but didn't stand out among the other varieties of chicken pieces.-KARAAGE: It was good because it's fried chicken, but not necessarily different or better than other Japanese restaurants I've tried. -CRAB CROQUETTES: Only came with two on a bed of lettuce, a little expensive for the portion. Though it was creamy and pretty good with the sauce.-PORK BELLY: It was fatty and juicy, as pork belly should be. But didn't stand out among the other varieties of skewers either.All in all, pretty delicious yakitori and would recommend since the atmosphere is enjoyable and the food has a lot of variety if you're feeling adventurous! There's also tables where you sit at a lower table with your legs under it in the ground, similar to how some of the restaurants are in Japan that I've been to. I've also heard about the soba at lunchtime and would love to come and try it."
1041,"Loved it here! Service was great and the food was amazing. As soon as you sit down, order the charbroiled rice balls (2 per order) because it takes 20 min. We also liked just about every piece of izakaya we ordered. A recommendation from the waitress was the bacon-wrapped mochi, and while I'm not usually a fan of mochi this was actually pretty good! What we didn't particularly enjoy was the tofu pouch (loved the tofu, not the beans inside -- too slimy for me). We also could have done without the cucumber app... It's just raw cucumber sticks and a sauce (while the sauce was tasty, we could have just ordered another izakaya dish).Overall, we loved this place and will totally come back!"
1042,"Only opens at 5pm and reservations are preferred. You can try to line up, but make sure to do it 5 mins earlier and have your party ready!This is a place worth checking out if you're in the area. I'm a little biased since I'm always down for Japanese. The décor and seating is nifty as you have to take off your shoes. We need more of those don't you think? Sunday was packed, so we just decided to eat standing up by the bar. It was a bit weird, but food waits for no one! Ippuku is yakitori style and so that means the dishes are smaller and takes longer to grill. There are other items such as noodles, rice, appetizers, and sweets. What our group of 3 ordered:- 2 carafe of hot sake- Shitake mushroom- Onigiri- Mochi riceball- Scallion pancake- Ippuku ramen- Ahi tuna, hamachi, salmon- Squid ink fried riceTotal of bill = $118 w/out tipsMy favorite was the squid ink fried rice. If I could eat that every day I would. That unique inky taste was excellent with rice. Where can I buy some squid ink? The food comes out slow, but that's how usually yakitori is. I think that's how they get you to drink more. The food was incredibly addictive delicious. Watch out, I'm coming back with more people so more food!!!"
1043,"Ippuku means cigarette break or to take a short break in Japanese. Fitting, since after eating here, I felt like a cigarette because the food was overhyped... and I don't even smoke. I wonder what long break is in Japanese (no-pick-u?) because I don't think I'm going back.After luckily finding parking in front of Sliver Pizza at 6 PM when the meters turn off, we were seated at the back bar where the cooking happens. There was a lame sign that said no photos, but we all know that rules are meant to be broken. And it's not like izakaya food is some sort of trade fu*king secret. SMH.The wife and I ordered the famous/infamous chicken tartare, chef's choice skewers, grilled Hokkaido squid and some Asahis ($8).The chicken tartare was interesting with its rubbery texture, but is not something I ever need to try again. I now know that I prefer steak tartare and would rather brave Mad Cow disease over salmonella any day. Our chef's choice chicken skewers were not inputted into the POS (point-of-sale not piece-of-sh*t) system by our server due to some sort of lost in translation error.

1051,"My husband found his place and he is from SoCal where they have dominated izakaya cuisine decades ago.  This place is solid and our go to for the past few years.  (Not Musha level in Torrance but will do the job for NorCal) There is room for improvement around variety, but their dishes and venue is satisfying for that izakaya fix.  Here's our favs:-karaage-corn fritter (kids love it)-gyoza ( skin is thin$-grilled: gizzard, b.tongue, teba, kushi, bacon mochi, quail egg (I like quail egg but it's not amazing in any way for $8)-crab croquette (delish, fried creamy rich goodness)-chicken udon (YUM, so tasty)-yaki onigri in chicken soup (major comfort food, so GOOD)-my kids also love the complimentary cabbage and mayoMake a resi unless you want to sit at the weird tables facing the entry way with a tiny curtain (tiny=it may cover a small face/head).  But all in all love this east bay joint and plenty of dessert options on the same block btw, be prepared to pay a premium...it will make your meal more enjoyable"
1052,"This has been on my list to try around Oakland and when I got an invite for dinner meeting, I chose this place. I brought the lovey ofcourse for dinner. Our reservations was at 7:30 pm on a Thursday and its good thing I made one. The wait was an hour. BTW - there's no huge sign for this place, so just look for Ben & Jerry and it is next door. As you walk in, this heater hits you and welcomes you inside. Then it gets cold again as you continue to walk in because they have all the windows by the ceiling ,,, OPEN.  I guess it is open, to prevent the place from getting too smoky.We got seated down to a booth and noticed that our legs were getting warmer..... Guess what.. There is a heater underneath the tables... Nice touch but still kept my arms cold.Once we were all settled, we ordered the following..Shishito peppersSpinach with black inkChicken karaageFried MackerelChicken thigh skewers Chizakepork belly skewersmushroom tempurabrown rice teagrilled squidrice with squid inkgrilled rice bowls (takes 20 minutes, so order ahead)scallion pancakeEverything was good but served in very small portions so make sure you order enough for the group.  Even the water glasses are small.  Food was great and flavors were on point.  The tea was good but it got cold super fast because it was cold inside. Service was fast though.I took a few pics of what we had because were devoured most of the other dishes before I can even take a pic.If you plan to come here, make reservations and wear warm clothes. TRUST!!!btw-parking could be difficult but you can park in the bank parking lot after 6 and pay per hour instead of $28 for the whole day."
1053,"Finally we came, on a Week day early evening.The food was great. Chicken heart, beef tongue!, pork belly, etc. we also tried their Ikasumi Chahan [Squid Ink Fried Rice].I liked their food, but the service was not as nice as we hoped, the waitress kept asking us to either order more, or pay the check and leave, saying that there are people waiting in line. But when we left we didn't find many people waiting... kind of disappointing."
1054,"Delicious food! And the service was great! Hey really helped me out, who was out of town and read great things about this restaurant. Really enjoyed everything and loved the seating; very Asian style. Just wished the Dungeness crab croquettes had more crab. Overall, great hip happenin' place to visit!"
1055,"I visited Ippuku a few weeks ago, and it is sad that there are not many great Yakitori Izakaya in Bay Area.The service was great, and I felt that they try to take care of their customers. The taste of the food was good, but it seemed that there is some overpriced dish. Although the Wagyu beef skewer is really tasty, the price is totally overpriced. Also, this place aims to create the Izakaya style, so the portion of food is small in quantity to make you feel full. In addition, the brew was excellent to sip the creaminess and the freshness.Overall, they have very good customer service, but the price seems overpriced. The atmosphere makes you feel that you are in Japan. If you like the creamy brew, you must try it.Service: +Taste: AverageValue: -Atmosphere: +"
1056,"Ambiance and the seating inside is very unique! My friends and I had made a reservation, and were seated in the authentic-feeling Japanese tables, where we took off our shoes and sat on cushions placed on wooden benches.I ordered a grapefruit cocktail to start, and my friends ordered 2 beers. The cocktail was so unique! It was a sort of a DIY mixed drink, where I personally juiced my grapefruit and mixed the freshly squeezed juice with my sohchu. A little strong for my taste but a fun drink to order!Now the food was AMAZING. These tapas were so so tasty. We ordered a number of chicken skewers but the skin skewers and the squid ink fried rice definitely stood out. There was so much flavor in the fried rice, we cleaned the bowl! Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of everything since it was hard to resist eating the food as soon as it was put in front of you, but I managed to get a few snaps! A little pricey but def worth if you'd like to treat yourself and your friends to a tasty meal!"
1057,"This place is so fun.  It's a really great experience to come with friends.  My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Japan last year, and this place hits the mark.  The food isn't the best in the world, but the vibe is super cool.  It's a great night out to get hammered and snack on izakaya with a crew.  The yakitori wasn't memorable, and is disappointing by true Japanese standards, and the prices aren't cheap.  But it gets 5 stars just for the experience."
1058,"This small shop is an amazing izakaya (Japanese gastropub), lightly dimmed with wooden tables and chairs topped with extremely comfortable cushions. They even offer a blanket to keep you extra comfy...The Wagyu simply melts in the mouth; however, it was so oily that it covered the flavour of the beef. It was accompanied by a side of green tea salt which pairs very well with the meat.."
1059,"The chef certainly has great command over izakaya style traditional room. The texture was superb and flavors were good. I came with high expectations since it has a high reputation in the area. I got the chicken ramen and the broth was too salty and bland for my taste but the quality of ramen noodle and the texture is one of the best I've had. We added some pepper to add more flavor to the ramen. The chicken gyoza was delicious with the right balance of flavor, crispiness, tender meat, and delicate dough.  The grilled mochi wrapped in nori was very unique, interesting, and delightful. The yaki onigiri was one of the best textures of perfectly crispy rice on the outside and soft but not overcooked rice on the inside.Decor was lovely and authentic, service was great, and the tea is delicious. They do charge $7 cover per person in lieu of gratuity, which I find to be unreasonably high considering it isn't a music venue or bar lounge. The extra cover bumps the final tab to a higher number which we felt didn't match the quality of the food."
