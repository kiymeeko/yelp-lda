0,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
1,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."
2,"Best Vegan dessert in Berkeley! The cinnamon buns taste so good I had to ask few times that are they really vegan! You can get the mini buns but you can't customize them. They taste good though. If you are taking it to go or eating while walking, then get the mini ones.If you are getting the regular size buns this is how to order: select the type of frosting you like from the menu ($.25 c for flavor frosting except for the vanilla). Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
3,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!
4,"The BEST place to get your fix of cinnamon rolls.Every time I return to Berkeley, I make it a point to visit and indulge in at least 1. They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"
5,"I wanted to try this place because I love cinnamon buns and this had great reviews. We got one of their recommended flavors cheesecake. My husband initially just wanted few bites but he just kept eating, yup he liked it. I wouldn't have shared but well I guess less sugar. I'd definitely come back here."
6,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
7,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
8,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is. These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
9,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."
10,"For vegan cinnamon rolls, there are soo tasty. I got the Old Skool, which was just your regular cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting. Despite going for a pretty basic option, my taste buds enjoyed the soft warm buns covered in frosting immensely (though I'd have to say the cinnamon taste wasn't strong enough). I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
11,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
12,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
13,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
14,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
15,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
16,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"
17,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
18,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
19,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"

The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
49,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."
50,"For vegan cinnamon rolls, there are soo tasty. I got the Old Skool, which was just your regular cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting. Despite going for a pretty basic option, my taste buds enjoyed the soft warm buns covered in frosting immensely (though I'd have to say the cinnamon taste wasn't strong enough). I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
51,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
52,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
53,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
54,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
55,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
56,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"
57,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
58,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
59,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
60,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
61,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."
62,"Best Vegan dessert in Berkeley! The cinnamon buns taste so good I had to ask few times that are they really vegan! You can get the mini buns but you can't customize them. They taste good though. If you are taking it to go or eating while walking, then get the mini ones.If you are getting the regular size buns this is how to order: select the type of frosting you like from the menu ($.25 c for flavor frosting except for the vanilla). Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
63,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!
64,"The BEST place to get your fix of cinnamon rolls.Every time I return to Berkeley, I make it a point to visit and indulge in at least 1. They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"
65,"I wanted to try this place because I love cinnamon buns and this had great reviews. We got one of their recommended flavors cheesecake. My husband initially just wanted few bites but he just kept eating, yup he liked it. I wouldn't have shared but well I guess less sugar. I'd definitely come back here."
66,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
67,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
68,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is.

I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great.

I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
100,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
101,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."
102,"Best Vegan dessert in Berkeley! The cinnamon buns taste so good I had to ask few times that are they really vegan! You can get the mini buns but you can't customize them. They taste good though. If you are taking it to go or eating while walking, then get the mini ones.If you are getting the regular size buns this is how to order: select the type of frosting you like from the menu ($.25 c for flavor frosting except for the vanilla). Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
103,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!
104,"The BEST place to get your fix of cinnamon rolls.Every time I return to Berkeley, I make it a point to visit and indulge in at least 1. They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"
105,"I wanted to try this place because I love cinnamon buns and this had great reviews. We got one of their recommended flavors cheesecake. My husband initially just wanted few bites but he just kept eating, yup he liked it. I wouldn't have shared but well I guess less sugar. I'd definitely come back here."
106,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
107,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
108,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is. These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
109,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."
110,"For vegan cinnamon rolls, there are soo tasty. I got the Old Skool, which was just your regular cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting. Despite going for a pretty basic option, my taste buds enjoyed the soft warm buns covered in frosting immensely (though I'd have to say the cinnamon taste wasn't strong enough). I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
111,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
112,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
113,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
114,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
115,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
116,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"
117,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
118,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."

The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
148,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is. These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
149,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."
150,"For vegan cinnamon rolls, there are soo tasty. I got the Old Skool, which was just your regular cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting. Despite going for a pretty basic option, my taste buds enjoyed the soft warm buns covered in frosting immensely (though I'd have to say the cinnamon taste wasn't strong enough). I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
151,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
152,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
153,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
154,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
155,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
156,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"
157,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
158,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
159,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
160,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
161,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."
162,"Best Vegan dessert in Berkeley! The cinnamon buns taste so good I had to ask few times that are they really vegan! You can get the mini buns but you can't customize them. They taste good though. If you are taking it to go or eating while walking, then get the mini ones.If you are getting the regular size buns this is how to order: select the type of frosting you like from the menu ($.25 c for flavor frosting except for the vanilla). Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
163,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!
164,"The BEST place to get your fix of cinnamon rolls.Every time I return to Berkeley, I make it a point to visit and indulge in at least 1. They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"
165,"I wanted to try this place because I love cinnamon buns and this had great reviews. We got one of their recommended flavors cheesecake. My husband initially just wanted few bites but he just kept eating, yup he liked it. I wouldn't have shared but well I guess less sugar. I'd definitely come back here."
166,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
167,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone.

197,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
198,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
199,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
200,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
201,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."
202,"Best Vegan dessert in Berkeley! The cinnamon buns taste so good I had to ask few times that are they really vegan! You can get the mini buns but you can't customize them. They taste good though. If you are taking it to go or eating while walking, then get the mini ones.If you are getting the regular size buns this is how to order: select the type of frosting you like from the menu ($.25 c for flavor frosting except for the vanilla). Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
203,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!
204,"The BEST place to get your fix of cinnamon rolls.Every time I return to Berkeley, I make it a point to visit and indulge in at least 1. They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"
205,"I wanted to try this place because I love cinnamon buns and this had great reviews. We got one of their recommended flavors cheesecake. My husband initially just wanted few bites but he just kept eating, yup he liked it. I wouldn't have shared but well I guess less sugar. I'd definitely come back here."
206,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
207,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
208,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is. These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
209,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."
210,"For vegan cinnamon rolls, there are soo tasty. I got the Old Skool, which was just your regular cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting. Despite going for a pretty basic option, my taste buds enjoyed the soft warm buns covered in frosting immensely (though I'd have to say the cinnamon taste wasn't strong enough). I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
211,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
212,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
213,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
214,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
215,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
216,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though!

246,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
247,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
248,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is. These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
249,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."
250,"For vegan cinnamon rolls, there are soo tasty. I got the Old Skool, which was just your regular cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting. Despite going for a pretty basic option, my taste buds enjoyed the soft warm buns covered in frosting immensely (though I'd have to say the cinnamon taste wasn't strong enough). I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
251,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
252,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
253,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
254,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
255,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
256,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"
257,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
258,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
259,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
260,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
261,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."
262,"Best Vegan dessert in Berkeley! The cinnamon buns taste so good I had to ask few times that are they really vegan! You can get the mini buns but you can't customize them. They taste good though. If you are taking it to go or eating while walking, then get the mini ones.If you are getting the regular size buns this is how to order: select the type of frosting you like from the menu ($.25 c for flavor frosting except for the vanilla). Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
263,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!
264,"The BEST place to get your fix of cinnamon rolls.Every time I return to Berkeley, I make it a point to visit and indulge in at least 1. They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"

I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
295,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
296,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"
297,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
298,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
299,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
300,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
301,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."
302,"Best Vegan dessert in Berkeley! The cinnamon buns taste so good I had to ask few times that are they really vegan! You can get the mini buns but you can't customize them. They taste good though. If you are taking it to go or eating while walking, then get the mini ones.If you are getting the regular size buns this is how to order: select the type of frosting you like from the menu ($.25 c for flavor frosting except for the vanilla). Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
303,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!
304,"The BEST place to get your fix of cinnamon rolls.Every time I return to Berkeley, I make it a point to visit and indulge in at least 1. They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"
305,"I wanted to try this place because I love cinnamon buns and this had great reviews. We got one of their recommended flavors cheesecake. My husband initially just wanted few bites but he just kept eating, yup he liked it. I wouldn't have shared but well I guess less sugar. I'd definitely come back here."
306,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
307,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
308,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is. These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
309,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."
310,"For vegan cinnamon rolls, there are soo tasty. I got the Old Skool, which was just your regular cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting. Despite going for a pretty basic option, my taste buds enjoyed the soft warm buns covered in frosting immensely (though I'd have to say the cinnamon taste wasn't strong enough). I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
311,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
312,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
313,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
314,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top.

They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"
345,"I wanted to try this place because I love cinnamon buns and this had great reviews. We got one of their recommended flavors cheesecake. My husband initially just wanted few bites but he just kept eating, yup he liked it. I wouldn't have shared but well I guess less sugar. I'd definitely come back here."
346,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
347,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
348,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is. These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
349,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."
350,"For vegan cinnamon rolls, there are soo tasty. I got the Old Skool, which was just your regular cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting. Despite going for a pretty basic option, my taste buds enjoyed the soft warm buns covered in frosting immensely (though I'd have to say the cinnamon taste wasn't strong enough). I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
351,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
352,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
353,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
354,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
355,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
356,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"
357,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
358,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
359,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
360,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
361,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."
362,"Best Vegan dessert in Berkeley! The cinnamon buns taste so good I had to ask few times that are they really vegan! You can get the mini buns but you can't customize them. They taste good though. If you are taking it to go or eating while walking, then get the mini ones.If you are getting the regular size buns this is how to order: select the type of frosting you like from the menu ($.25 c for flavor frosting except for the vanilla). Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
363,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!

Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
392,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
393,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
394,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
395,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
396,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"
397,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
398,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
399,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
400,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
401,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."
402,"Best Vegan dessert in Berkeley! The cinnamon buns taste so good I had to ask few times that are they really vegan! You can get the mini buns but you can't customize them. They taste good though. If you are taking it to go or eating while walking, then get the mini ones.If you are getting the regular size buns this is how to order: select the type of frosting you like from the menu ($.25 c for flavor frosting except for the vanilla). Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
403,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!
404,"The BEST place to get your fix of cinnamon rolls.Every time I return to Berkeley, I make it a point to visit and indulge in at least 1. They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"
405,"I wanted to try this place because I love cinnamon buns and this had great reviews. We got one of their recommended flavors cheesecake. My husband initially just wanted few bites but he just kept eating, yup he liked it. I wouldn't have shared but well I guess less sugar. I'd definitely come back here."
406,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
407,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
408,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is. These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
409,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."
410,"For vegan cinnamon rolls, there are soo tasty. I got the Old Skool, which was just your regular cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting. Despite going for a pretty basic option, my taste buds enjoyed the soft warm buns covered in frosting immensely (though I'd have to say the cinnamon taste wasn't strong enough). I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
411,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from.

Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
443,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!
444,"The BEST place to get your fix of cinnamon rolls.Every time I return to Berkeley, I make it a point to visit and indulge in at least 1. They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"
445,"I wanted to try this place because I love cinnamon buns and this had great reviews. We got one of their recommended flavors cheesecake. My husband initially just wanted few bites but he just kept eating, yup he liked it. I wouldn't have shared but well I guess less sugar. I'd definitely come back here."
446,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
447,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
448,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is. These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
449,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."
450,"For vegan cinnamon rolls, there are soo tasty. I got the Old Skool, which was just your regular cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting. Despite going for a pretty basic option, my taste buds enjoyed the soft warm buns covered in frosting immensely (though I'd have to say the cinnamon taste wasn't strong enough). I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
451,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
452,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
453,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
454,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
455,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
456,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"
457,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
458,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
459,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
460,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
461,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."

However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
491,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
492,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
493,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
494,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
495,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
496,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"
497,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
498,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
499,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
500,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
501,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."
502,"Best Vegan dessert in Berkeley! The cinnamon buns taste so good I had to ask few times that are they really vegan! You can get the mini buns but you can't customize them. They taste good though. If you are taking it to go or eating while walking, then get the mini ones.If you are getting the regular size buns this is how to order: select the type of frosting you like from the menu ($.25 c for flavor frosting except for the vanilla). Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
503,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!
504,"The BEST place to get your fix of cinnamon rolls.Every time I return to Berkeley, I make it a point to visit and indulge in at least 1. They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"
505,"I wanted to try this place because I love cinnamon buns and this had great reviews. We got one of their recommended flavors cheesecake. My husband initially just wanted few bites but he just kept eating, yup he liked it. I wouldn't have shared but well I guess less sugar. I'd definitely come back here."
506,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
507,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
508,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is. These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
509,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."

My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
541,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."
542,"Best Vegan dessert in Berkeley! The cinnamon buns taste so good I had to ask few times that are they really vegan! You can get the mini buns but you can't customize them. They taste good though. If you are taking it to go or eating while walking, then get the mini ones.If you are getting the regular size buns this is how to order: select the type of frosting you like from the menu ($.25 c for flavor frosting except for the vanilla). Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
543,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!
544,"The BEST place to get your fix of cinnamon rolls.Every time I return to Berkeley, I make it a point to visit and indulge in at least 1. They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"
545,"I wanted to try this place because I love cinnamon buns and this had great reviews. We got one of their recommended flavors cheesecake. My husband initially just wanted few bites but he just kept eating, yup he liked it. I wouldn't have shared but well I guess less sugar. I'd definitely come back here."
546,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
547,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
548,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is. These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
549,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."
550,"For vegan cinnamon rolls, there are soo tasty. I got the Old Skool, which was just your regular cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting. Despite going for a pretty basic option, my taste buds enjoyed the soft warm buns covered in frosting immensely (though I'd have to say the cinnamon taste wasn't strong enough). I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
551,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
552,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
553,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
554,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
555,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
556,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"
557,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
558,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
559,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
560,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me?

589,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."
590,"For vegan cinnamon rolls, there are soo tasty. I got the Old Skool, which was just your regular cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting. Despite going for a pretty basic option, my taste buds enjoyed the soft warm buns covered in frosting immensely (though I'd have to say the cinnamon taste wasn't strong enough). I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
591,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
592,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
593,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
594,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
595,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
596,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"
597,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
598,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
599,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
600,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
601,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."
602,"Best Vegan dessert in Berkeley! The cinnamon buns taste so good I had to ask few times that are they really vegan! You can get the mini buns but you can't customize them. They taste good though. If you are taking it to go or eating while walking, then get the mini ones.If you are getting the regular size buns this is how to order: select the type of frosting you like from the menu ($.25 c for flavor frosting except for the vanilla). Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
603,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!
604,"The BEST place to get your fix of cinnamon rolls.Every time I return to Berkeley, I make it a point to visit and indulge in at least 1. They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"
605,"I wanted to try this place because I love cinnamon buns and this had great reviews. We got one of their recommended flavors cheesecake. My husband initially just wanted few bites but he just kept eating, yup he liked it. I wouldn't have shared but well I guess less sugar. I'd definitely come back here."
606,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
607,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
608,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is. These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well.

The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
640,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
641,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."
642,"Best Vegan dessert in Berkeley! The cinnamon buns taste so good I had to ask few times that are they really vegan! You can get the mini buns but you can't customize them. They taste good though. If you are taking it to go or eating while walking, then get the mini ones.If you are getting the regular size buns this is how to order: select the type of frosting you like from the menu ($.25 c for flavor frosting except for the vanilla). Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
643,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!
644,"The BEST place to get your fix of cinnamon rolls.Every time I return to Berkeley, I make it a point to visit and indulge in at least 1. They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"
645,"I wanted to try this place because I love cinnamon buns and this had great reviews. We got one of their recommended flavors cheesecake. My husband initially just wanted few bites but he just kept eating, yup he liked it. I wouldn't have shared but well I guess less sugar. I'd definitely come back here."
646,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
647,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
648,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is. These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
649,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."
650,"For vegan cinnamon rolls, there are soo tasty. I got the Old Skool, which was just your regular cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting. Despite going for a pretty basic option, my taste buds enjoyed the soft warm buns covered in frosting immensely (though I'd have to say the cinnamon taste wasn't strong enough). I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
651,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
652,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
653,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
654,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
655,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
656,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"
657,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
658,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
659,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls.

I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
688,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is. These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
689,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."
690,"For vegan cinnamon rolls, there are soo tasty. I got the Old Skool, which was just your regular cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting. Despite going for a pretty basic option, my taste buds enjoyed the soft warm buns covered in frosting immensely (though I'd have to say the cinnamon taste wasn't strong enough). I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
691,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
692,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
693,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
694,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
695,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
696,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"
697,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
698,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
699,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
700,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
701,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."
702,"Best Vegan dessert in Berkeley! The cinnamon buns taste so good I had to ask few times that are they really vegan! You can get the mini buns but you can't customize them. They taste good though. If you are taking it to go or eating while walking, then get the mini ones.If you are getting the regular size buns this is how to order: select the type of frosting you like from the menu ($.25 c for flavor frosting except for the vanilla). Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
703,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!
704,"The BEST place to get your fix of cinnamon rolls.Every time I return to Berkeley, I make it a point to visit and indulge in at least 1. They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"
705,"I wanted to try this place because I love cinnamon buns and this had great reviews. We got one of their recommended flavors cheesecake. My husband initially just wanted few bites but he just kept eating, yup he liked it. I wouldn't have shared but well I guess less sugar. I'd definitely come back here."
706,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
707,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought.

738,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
739,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
740,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
741,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."
742,"Best Vegan dessert in Berkeley! The cinnamon buns taste so good I had to ask few times that are they really vegan! You can get the mini buns but you can't customize them. They taste good though. If you are taking it to go or eating while walking, then get the mini ones.If you are getting the regular size buns this is how to order: select the type of frosting you like from the menu ($.25 c for flavor frosting except for the vanilla). Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
743,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!
744,"The BEST place to get your fix of cinnamon rolls.Every time I return to Berkeley, I make it a point to visit and indulge in at least 1. They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"
745,"I wanted to try this place because I love cinnamon buns and this had great reviews. We got one of their recommended flavors cheesecake. My husband initially just wanted few bites but he just kept eating, yup he liked it. I wouldn't have shared but well I guess less sugar. I'd definitely come back here."
746,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
747,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
748,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is. These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
749,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."
750,"For vegan cinnamon rolls, there are soo tasty. I got the Old Skool, which was just your regular cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting. Despite going for a pretty basic option, my taste buds enjoyed the soft warm buns covered in frosting immensely (though I'd have to say the cinnamon taste wasn't strong enough). I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
751,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
752,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
753,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
754,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
755,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
756,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"

786,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
787,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
788,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is. These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
789,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."
790,"For vegan cinnamon rolls, there are soo tasty. I got the Old Skool, which was just your regular cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting. Despite going for a pretty basic option, my taste buds enjoyed the soft warm buns covered in frosting immensely (though I'd have to say the cinnamon taste wasn't strong enough). I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
791,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
792,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
793,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
794,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
795,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
796,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"
797,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
798,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
799,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
800,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
801,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."
802,"Best Vegan dessert in Berkeley! The cinnamon buns taste so good I had to ask few times that are they really vegan! You can get the mini buns but you can't customize them. They taste good though. If you are taking it to go or eating while walking, then get the mini ones.If you are getting the regular size buns this is how to order: select the type of frosting you like from the menu ($.25 c for flavor frosting except for the vanilla). Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
803,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!
804,"The BEST place to get your fix of cinnamon rolls.Every time I return to Berkeley, I make it a point to visit and indulge in at least 1. They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"

I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
835,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
836,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"
837,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
838,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
839,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
840,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
841,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."
842,"Best Vegan dessert in Berkeley! The cinnamon buns taste so good I had to ask few times that are they really vegan! You can get the mini buns but you can't customize them. They taste good though. If you are taking it to go or eating while walking, then get the mini ones.If you are getting the regular size buns this is how to order: select the type of frosting you like from the menu ($.25 c for flavor frosting except for the vanilla). Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
843,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!
844,"The BEST place to get your fix of cinnamon rolls.Every time I return to Berkeley, I make it a point to visit and indulge in at least 1. They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"
845,"I wanted to try this place because I love cinnamon buns and this had great reviews. We got one of their recommended flavors cheesecake. My husband initially just wanted few bites but he just kept eating, yup he liked it. I wouldn't have shared but well I guess less sugar. I'd definitely come back here."
846,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
847,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
848,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is. These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
849,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."
850,"For vegan cinnamon rolls, there are soo tasty. I got the Old Skool, which was just your regular cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting. Despite going for a pretty basic option, my taste buds enjoyed the soft warm buns covered in frosting immensely (though I'd have to say the cinnamon taste wasn't strong enough). I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
851,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
852,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
853,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
854,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top.

They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"
885,"I wanted to try this place because I love cinnamon buns and this had great reviews. We got one of their recommended flavors cheesecake. My husband initially just wanted few bites but he just kept eating, yup he liked it. I wouldn't have shared but well I guess less sugar. I'd definitely come back here."
886,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
887,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
888,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is. These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
889,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."
890,"For vegan cinnamon rolls, there are soo tasty. I got the Old Skool, which was just your regular cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting. Despite going for a pretty basic option, my taste buds enjoyed the soft warm buns covered in frosting immensely (though I'd have to say the cinnamon taste wasn't strong enough). I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
891,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
892,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
893,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
894,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
895,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
896,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"
897,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
898,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
899,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
900,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
901,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."
902,"Best Vegan dessert in Berkeley! The cinnamon buns taste so good I had to ask few times that are they really vegan! You can get the mini buns but you can't customize them. They taste good though. If you are taking it to go or eating while walking, then get the mini ones.If you are getting the regular size buns this is how to order: select the type of frosting you like from the menu ($.25 c for flavor frosting except for the vanilla). Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
903,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly.

Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
932,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
933,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
934,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
935,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
936,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"
937,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
938,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
939,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
940,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
941,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."
942,"Best Vegan dessert in Berkeley! The cinnamon buns taste so good I had to ask few times that are they really vegan! You can get the mini buns but you can't customize them. They taste good though. If you are taking it to go or eating while walking, then get the mini ones.If you are getting the regular size buns this is how to order: select the type of frosting you like from the menu ($.25 c for flavor frosting except for the vanilla). Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
943,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!
944,"The BEST place to get your fix of cinnamon rolls.Every time I return to Berkeley, I make it a point to visit and indulge in at least 1. They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"
945,"I wanted to try this place because I love cinnamon buns and this had great reviews. We got one of their recommended flavors cheesecake. My husband initially just wanted few bites but he just kept eating, yup he liked it. I wouldn't have shared but well I guess less sugar. I'd definitely come back here."
946,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
947,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
948,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is. These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
949,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."
950,"For vegan cinnamon rolls, there are soo tasty. I got the Old Skool, which was just your regular cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting. Despite going for a pretty basic option, my taste buds enjoyed the soft warm buns covered in frosting immensely (though I'd have to say the cinnamon taste wasn't strong enough). I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
951,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from.

Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
983,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!
984,"The BEST place to get your fix of cinnamon rolls.Every time I return to Berkeley, I make it a point to visit and indulge in at least 1. They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"
985,"I wanted to try this place because I love cinnamon buns and this had great reviews. We got one of their recommended flavors cheesecake. My husband initially just wanted few bites but he just kept eating, yup he liked it. I wouldn't have shared but well I guess less sugar. I'd definitely come back here."
986,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
987,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
988,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is. These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
989,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."
990,"For vegan cinnamon rolls, there are soo tasty. I got the Old Skool, which was just your regular cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting. Despite going for a pretty basic option, my taste buds enjoyed the soft warm buns covered in frosting immensely (though I'd have to say the cinnamon taste wasn't strong enough). I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
991,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
992,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
993,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
994,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
995,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
996,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"
997,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
998,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
999,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
1000,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
1001,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all.

I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
1031,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
1032,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
1033,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
1034,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
1035,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
1036,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"
1037,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
1038,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
1039,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
1040,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
1041,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."
1042,"Best Vegan dessert in Berkeley! The cinnamon buns taste so good I had to ask few times that are they really vegan! You can get the mini buns but you can't customize them. They taste good though. If you are taking it to go or eating while walking, then get the mini ones.If you are getting the regular size buns this is how to order: select the type of frosting you like from the menu ($.25 c for flavor frosting except for the vanilla). Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
1043,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!
1044,"The BEST place to get your fix of cinnamon rolls.Every time I return to Berkeley, I make it a point to visit and indulge in at least 1. They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"
1045,"I wanted to try this place because I love cinnamon buns and this had great reviews. We got one of their recommended flavors cheesecake. My husband initially just wanted few bites but he just kept eating, yup he liked it. I wouldn't have shared but well I guess less sugar. I'd definitely come back here."
1046,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
1047,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
1048,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is. These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
1049,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."

Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
1081,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."
1082,"Best Vegan dessert in Berkeley! The cinnamon buns taste so good I had to ask few times that are they really vegan! You can get the mini buns but you can't customize them. They taste good though. If you are taking it to go or eating while walking, then get the mini ones.If you are getting the regular size buns this is how to order: select the type of frosting you like from the menu ($.25 c for flavor frosting except for the vanilla). Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
1083,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!
1084,"The BEST place to get your fix of cinnamon rolls.Every time I return to Berkeley, I make it a point to visit and indulge in at least 1. They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"
1085,"I wanted to try this place because I love cinnamon buns and this had great reviews. We got one of their recommended flavors cheesecake. My husband initially just wanted few bites but he just kept eating, yup he liked it. I wouldn't have shared but well I guess less sugar. I'd definitely come back here."
1086,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
1087,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
1088,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is. These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
1089,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."
1090,"For vegan cinnamon rolls, there are soo tasty. I got the Old Skool, which was just your regular cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting. Despite going for a pretty basic option, my taste buds enjoyed the soft warm buns covered in frosting immensely (though I'd have to say the cinnamon taste wasn't strong enough). I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
1091,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
1092,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
1093,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
1094,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
1095,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
1096,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"
1097,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
1098,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
1099,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"

These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
1129,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."
1130,"For vegan cinnamon rolls, there are soo tasty. I got the Old Skool, which was just your regular cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting. Despite going for a pretty basic option, my taste buds enjoyed the soft warm buns covered in frosting immensely (though I'd have to say the cinnamon taste wasn't strong enough). I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
1131,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
1132,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
1133,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
1134,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
1135,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
1136,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"
1137,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
1138,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
1139,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
1140,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
1141,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."
1142,"Best Vegan dessert in Berkeley! The cinnamon buns taste so good I had to ask few times that are they really vegan! You can get the mini buns but you can't customize them. They taste good though. If you are taking it to go or eating while walking, then get the mini ones.If you are getting the regular size buns this is how to order: select the type of frosting you like from the menu ($.25 c for flavor frosting except for the vanilla). Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
1143,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!
1144,"The BEST place to get your fix of cinnamon rolls.Every time I return to Berkeley, I make it a point to visit and indulge in at least 1. They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"
1145,"I wanted to try this place because I love cinnamon buns and this had great reviews. We got one of their recommended flavors cheesecake. My husband initially just wanted few bites but he just kept eating, yup he liked it. I wouldn't have shared but well I guess less sugar. I'd definitely come back here."
1146,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
1147,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"

1178,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
1179,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
1180,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
1181,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."
1182,"Best Vegan dessert in Berkeley! The cinnamon buns taste so good I had to ask few times that are they really vegan! You can get the mini buns but you can't customize them. They taste good though. If you are taking it to go or eating while walking, then get the mini ones.If you are getting the regular size buns this is how to order: select the type of frosting you like from the menu ($.25 c for flavor frosting except for the vanilla). Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
1183,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!
1184,"The BEST place to get your fix of cinnamon rolls.Every time I return to Berkeley, I make it a point to visit and indulge in at least 1. They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"
1185,"I wanted to try this place because I love cinnamon buns and this had great reviews. We got one of their recommended flavors cheesecake. My husband initially just wanted few bites but he just kept eating, yup he liked it. I wouldn't have shared but well I guess less sugar. I'd definitely come back here."
1186,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
1187,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
1188,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is. These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
1189,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."
1190,"For vegan cinnamon rolls, there are soo tasty. I got the Old Skool, which was just your regular cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting. Despite going for a pretty basic option, my taste buds enjoyed the soft warm buns covered in frosting immensely (though I'd have to say the cinnamon taste wasn't strong enough). I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
1191,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
1192,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
1193,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
1194,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
1195,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
1196,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"

My husband initially just wanted few bites but he just kept eating, yup he liked it. I wouldn't have shared but well I guess less sugar. I'd definitely come back here."
1226,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
1227,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
1228,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is. These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
1229,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."
1230,"For vegan cinnamon rolls, there are soo tasty. I got the Old Skool, which was just your regular cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting. Despite going for a pretty basic option, my taste buds enjoyed the soft warm buns covered in frosting immensely (though I'd have to say the cinnamon taste wasn't strong enough). I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
1231,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
1232,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
1233,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
1234,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
1235,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
1236,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"
1237,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
1238,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
1239,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
1240,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
1241,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."
1242,"Best Vegan dessert in Berkeley! The cinnamon buns taste so good I had to ask few times that are they really vegan! You can get the mini buns but you can't customize them. They taste good though. If you are taking it to go or eating while walking, then get the mini ones.If you are getting the regular size buns this is how to order: select the type of frosting you like from the menu ($.25 c for flavor frosting except for the vanilla). Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
1243,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!
1244,"The BEST place to get your fix of cinnamon rolls.Every time I return to Berkeley, I make it a point to visit and indulge in at least 1. They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"

1274,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
1275,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
1276,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"
1277,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
1278,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
1279,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
1280,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
1281,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."
1282,"Best Vegan dessert in Berkeley! The cinnamon buns taste so good I had to ask few times that are they really vegan! You can get the mini buns but you can't customize them. They taste good though. If you are taking it to go or eating while walking, then get the mini ones.If you are getting the regular size buns this is how to order: select the type of frosting you like from the menu ($.25 c for flavor frosting except for the vanilla). Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"
1283,Vegan Cinnamon Buns are the BEST! Cinnaholic has tons of options to customize your own bun and the possibilities are endless! My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!
1284,"The BEST place to get your fix of cinnamon rolls.Every time I return to Berkeley, I make it a point to visit and indulge in at least 1. They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"
1285,"I wanted to try this place because I love cinnamon buns and this had great reviews. We got one of their recommended flavors cheesecake. My husband initially just wanted few bites but he just kept eating, yup he liked it. I wouldn't have shared but well I guess less sugar. I'd definitely come back here."
1286,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
1287,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
1288,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is. These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
1289,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."
1290,"For vegan cinnamon rolls, there are soo tasty. I got the Old Skool, which was just your regular cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting. Despite going for a pretty basic option, my taste buds enjoyed the soft warm buns covered in frosting immensely (though I'd have to say the cinnamon taste wasn't strong enough). I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
1291,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
1292,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."

My go to is the Old Skool Bun which has vanilla frosting and then I got ahead and add strawberry and blueberry. It is so tasty! It is a tad bit sweet so I would ask for less frosting next time but nonetheless it is still super tasty.The service is always fast and friendly. If you're in the mood for something sweet this is your place! You also get 10% off when you check in on Yelp!
1324,"The BEST place to get your fix of cinnamon rolls.Every time I return to Berkeley, I make it a point to visit and indulge in at least 1. They're so popular, you're basically getting fresh and made to order rolls every time since there's more than likely a line. With all the different toppings and frostings you can think of, you're really able to make it your own here. I don't know what it is or how they get their dough to be so heavenly, but it's seriously the best of the best. It's soft and chewy and when baked fresh, you can see the cinnamon oozing out of the bun. (DROOLS!) I've customized my bun and gotten strawberries on top before and it was a nice balance. This time, I stuck with just their Old Skool that comes with only vanilla frosting. Still delicious as their cinnamon rolls are never a disappointment. It's just one of those things where you know is going to be good regardless of what you get. They also have baked goods (even vegan ones) and sell cookie dough here as well! Until next time, Cinnaholic!"
1325,"I wanted to try this place because I love cinnamon buns and this had great reviews. We got one of their recommended flavors cheesecake. My husband initially just wanted few bites but he just kept eating, yup he liked it. I wouldn't have shared but well I guess less sugar. I'd definitely come back here."
1326,"So damn good! I've had Cinnaholic before but I've always been a lil lazy to make it to the Berkeley location - finally did it today and it was 1000% worth it! There are few things better than getting a vegan cinnamon bun (get strawberries on top and then dm me a thank you note, ok?) and sitting in the sun, slowly savoring each soft, perfectly flavored, animal byproduct free bite. Highkey this is a great spot to bring a date if you want them to really like you and know that not only are you serious about yo vegan treats, but that you're willing to throw down $5 for them and the buns *wink emoji*"
1327,"I was super exited to try this but definitely skeptical about some of the flavors. You come and choose an icing flavor, ranging from regular cream cheese to amaretto to caramel and then you choose a topping ranging from almonds to bananas and apples.you can also choose from regular size for $5 or baby sizes for $1.25.The down side? They ran out of the baby sizes! Wth... Does this mean they don't make it fresh in store? I'm guessing so. I got a recreation of an apple pie with caramel icing with apples and brown sugar crumble on top. It was so good although the dough seemed a bit undone. The apples were nice and sweet though and it definitely tastes like apple pie but better. We also tried the amoreetto with almonds and that was really good as well, not overly sweet like I thought. I will definitely be back here for more and hopefully they will have baby ones so I can try more flavors"
1328,"Food 4/5. Service 5/5. Ambiance 5/5.Vegan cinnamon rolls, who would have known. Even though people say you can't tell if it's vegan, it's pretty obvious that it is. These cinnamon rolls are customizable. You can customize the type of frosting and which toppings you want. The frostings comes in flavor such as strawberry or pina colada and more. I usually go with the classic, since the other flavors just seem artificial. There is a million different combinations of toppings you can add. Because the cinnamon roll is so sweet, I recommend fruit as it balances the sweetness with its tartness.The service here is great. The people behind the counter is always nice and is more than happy to help you. They usually have predesign options if you can't decide as well. Tips - Don't get the flavored frosting because it's too sweet and artificial. These cinnamon rolls have a different taste to them so don't expect them to taste exactly like normal ones. Pro - Freshly made and its vegan, which means it's healthy right? Con - too many combinations can be good or bad. Some combinations are too much."
1329,"A vegan cinnamon bun bakery in Berkeley, because of course!  Tasty enough to satisfy even those not opposed to eggs and dairy.  Great snack before whatever event brings you downtown.Marshmallow Frosting w/ Cookie Dough: So decadent, I can't believe it's vegan!  There is no compromising on the cinnamon roll, tastes just as a good as a Cinnabon at the mall.  The marshmallow frosting was creamy and tasty, but wasn't quite as a sticky as Fluff.  Loved loved loved the raw chocolate chip cookie dough dollop on top.  Tasted like real cookie dough, not those pasty nuggets sometimes found in ice cream."
1330,"For vegan cinnamon rolls, there are soo tasty. I got the Old Skool, which was just your regular cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting. Despite going for a pretty basic option, my taste buds enjoyed the soft warm buns covered in frosting immensely (though I'd have to say the cinnamon taste wasn't strong enough). I'm sure if I went for the more decadent options, like peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips or something, I would've fallen in love with it even more. However, it's probably best that I'm not too in love with it since each roll (the roll alone) packs around 650 calories! (But hey, we're here to eat, have some cheat days every now and then..or everyday..)But comparing these rolls to Cinnabon, non-vegan cinnamon rolls, which isn't quite that fair of a comparison, I think Cinnabon wins. Maybe if there were a stronger cinnamon taste I would've enjoyed this one more? I'm not sure...That being said, I'd still come here and would probably opt for their more decadent options! And I love that it's vegan!"
1331,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
1332,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
1333,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
1334,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
1335,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
1336,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"
1337,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
1338,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
1339,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
1340,"I moved to the Bay Area about two weeks ago, but I've known about Cinnaholic for months. Yeah, I think that pretty much tells you all you need to know...but brevity isn't my strong suit. Anyway, I've been dying to give this place a try AND TODAY WAS FINALLY MY DAY. I am a changed woman. First and foremost, the options are ridiculous! Theyve got a killer list of icings and toppings to help you create your dream cinnamon roll. Toppings are only 50 cents each, so feel free to get a lil wild. If you need some guidance, theres a display case with some amazing combinations already lined up, so you can go for whatever looks good (all of them). They've also got other baked goods like cookies and brownies available. As for me? Well, after much deliberation, I finally decided to get a cinnamon roll with butterscotch icing, oreos, and caramel drizzle. My boyfriend scored one with cake batter icing, cookie dough, and chocolate syrup. UGH. I KNOW RIGHT?! What a time to be alive. Service is quick as a whip. It was the cashier's first day, but she was friendly and fast nevertheless. By the time I returned my debit card to my wallet, the other staff member was already calling me to pick up my order at the other end. incredible. When youre jonesin for a taste of that sweet sweet,cinnamon, aint nothin better than a quick and easyfix. I'm hooked. Officially a Cinnaholic."
1341,"I'm not a fan of sweets, but this place is amazing! The bun was toasted warm and fresh and the frosting was the right amount of sweet- it wasn't overpowering at all. Overall, the dessert isn't expensive at all either. old Skool is the original bun and it rocked my world. It's a must try! Definitely going to return."
1342,"Best Vegan dessert in Berkeley! The cinnamon buns taste so good I had to ask few times that are they really vegan! You can get the mini buns but you can't customize them. They taste good though. If you are taking it to go or eating while walking, then get the mini ones.If you are getting the regular size buns this is how to order: select the type of frosting you like from the menu ($.25 c for flavor frosting except for the vanilla). Then select a topping. Each topping is $.50 c. Be mindful so you don't end up paying $10 for a cinnamon bun! Based on the flavor availability the day I went, I could have created 504 different combination of frosting and toppings (selecting a single frosting and topping). How cool that is? My suggestion though is to select a fresh fruit for the topping, as the frosting are really sweet. You want something to counter the sweetness. The service was great! I am a fan!"

And I love that it's vegan!"
1371,"TL;DR VEGAN cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS, try the irish cream + strawberry combo if you can't decide!!I LOVE Cinnaholic!! I already loved cinnamon rolls before I went to Cinnaholic, but I love them even more now. Heating up the cinnamon rolls does take quite a bit of time, but it's worth the wait.  My favorite combo so far is Irish Cream + strawberry, nice and simple. Every time I've been here, the staff have been really nice and they never judge you for staring at the menu for a long time because there's so many topping to choose from. If you absolutely can decide on a topping combo, they have some pre-determined toppings on cinnamon rolls on display that you can choose from. Also, eat them while they're still warm for the best possible Cinnaholic experience, though they're still good even when they're not warm anymore."
1372,"I gave Cinnaholic a go because I saw it on Shark Tank - the sharks thought it was delicious, so I thought I would too!Turns out they must have a much bigger sweet tooth than me, because my cinnamon roll was far too sweet for my liking. They were definitely delicious, and pleasantly vegan, but the icing made my teeth hurt. If you're into vegan treats and have a huge sweet tooth, you should try Cinnaholic. If you're more into refined desserts with high quality flavor, skip this place - there's plenty other delicious cinnamon rolls worth your money."
1373,"It's basically a Cinnabon with fruit! Nothing special! You get to choose from a variety of frostings. We chose strawberry. Then you chose toppings from the list. We added two toppings, chocolate chips and berries. Price is reasonable."
1374,"Absolutely delicious cinnamon roll, however it's extremely sweet! I got the classic sized cinnamon roll with cake batter frosting and cookie dough on top. Being an extreme sweet tooth I made my husband get his own miniature bun. Whoops! I definitely wasn't able to eat mine on my own because it was too sweet to eat in one sitting. I guess it worked out better that way though because I was able to save the rest for later. The bun still reheated well later that night. I would definitely visit this place again when I'm back in town!"
1375,"I still can't believe these are vegan, thank God the shark tank hosted them or I might have never heard of them! These are heaven and they were so worth the 2 hr commute! Will do it again next Saturday too! Loooove love love! And all I've tried is the Old School!"
1376,"My mom picked up a box of assorted flavors and they were pretty decent! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon rolls to begin with, but thought the rolls themselves had the perfect level of sweetness. The frosting and toppings, however, were waaayyyy too sweet though (unless you're into that). I ended up scraping off most of it, but the plain roll is something I would definitely want to have again!It's super exciting that vegan bakeries like this are starting to pop up though! As someone with dairy and egg allergies, I can never expect to partake in any sort of special dessert that's not homemade - extra points for that alone :)"
1377,This review is for the wait. I waited 10 min to order and still waiting after 15 for the actually cinnamon bun. So no idea how it tastes. I will give it 5 stars if it deserves that but come on! Should have been properly warned on the wait
1378,"I came here earlier today and got a roll with blueberry icing, blueberries, and pie crumble. The staff working was super nice! I started eating my roll and had to stop though because the icing tasted like soap. I thought it might've just been me, so I asked my friends to try it, and they both said it tasted like soap too. I ended up throwing mine away and eating theirs - hazelnut + choc chip + strawberries, and cream cheese + raspberry jam + pie crumbles. They were really tasty!Disappointed that I spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away, especially after looking at all the other rave reviews. Maybe I'll give this place another try in the future, but as of today I'm pretty turned off."
1379,"I feel like I learned what to do next time I come here: don't put sugar on top of sugar!It was my first time here and I was attracted to the fact that they're vegan cinnamon rolls. They're not too expensive but they can be if you put a lot of toppings. I think next time I'll try to get more fruit instead of sugary toppings because somehow I didn't register that putting cookie dough on top of a cinnamon roll would be beyond sweet! The staff is very helpful because I had no idea what to do when I walked in. They have a cute, small shop and I felt welcomed right away. The cinnamon rolls were SO good. I'll update this soon with my next visit for sure!"
