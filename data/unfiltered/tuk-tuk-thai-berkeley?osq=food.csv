0,"Yum! One of my favorite places to grab Thai food in Berkeley. PROS(+) Awesome Food! The Pad Kee Mao here is delicious - they offer generous portions of noodles - it's not overrun with greens, and if you order protein they really put a lot of it in!(+) Perfect level of spiciness. They have sauces readily available if you would like to add extra spiciness to it. (+) Quick service! Waiters are super attentive and the food comes out in good time. (+) Spacious restaurant - always plenty of room and they spread you out so you aren't seated RIGHT next to another party. (+) Open Late! (+) The candy they give you with your check is really good. CONS(-) More casual/basic kind of place. This isn't like a fancy restaurant, or a place to ""WOW"" your date. Just good food :)"
1,"Super cheap, they don't give rice with their curry and I ordered delivery so there was nothing I could do about it. I was stuck eat curry. Without rice. Just curry.Even worse, I specifically asked the noodles not to be spicy but it's very spicy and I can't eat it. You can see all the chili they added.Sorry, I probably won't be returning unless something was done about the rice issue."
2,"I thought I would try a new delivery place, but I won't try Tuk Tuk Thai again. The noodles were pretty much a compressed brick in the container and half of the spring rolls had burst open. That would probably be fine, but I just didn't enjoy the quality or taste of the food very much."
3,"Hmm... I've been coming here for years and I've never written a review for Tuk Tuk Thai Cafe? What?! This was my first experience eating thai food from a restaurant back when I started my food adventure life so, Tuk Tuk Thai will always have a little special place in my heart especially for Pad Kee Mao as this was the cafe I was first introduced to this dish (I've only had Pad Thai at the time).The workers are very friendly and the majority of the workers are Thai. On the outside this cafe seems really small and intimate and once you enter you'll be surprise on how spacious this Thai Cafe is.Food review:Their food is pretty solid and I feel it can blow some of the other Thai-American restaurants out the water. The dishes i've had were all flavorful and cooked perfectly.The Pad Kee Mao is stir fried perfectly and have a nice hint of sweetness and full basil flavor with nice heat to the dish. Their red and yellow curries are rich and packed with flavor and the chicken wasn't overcooked at all like some Thai-American places. The beef salad is made very well and one of the best i've had with a perfect amount of rice powder and the beef being really tender. The papaya salad, although i prefer the Lao style is well done here with a slight sweetness and a nice texture from the string beans.My go to dish right now is the BBQ New York Steak which as friend introduced me to a couple years back. What i love most is they know how to cook a good steak, when i ask for medium rare, I get medium rare every time and the size of the steak is pretty large. The house made teriyaki sauce gives the meat a nice tangy flavor without drowning out the taste of the actual meat and the jues sauce is salty and mild in heat that balances out the steak perfectly. End food reviewI've always have got great customer service here parking might not be the best at certain times but, it's my go to place that's close to where I live. They have a great happy hour menu and they're open late (1:30am). If you're out and about drinking this is the perfect spot to end your night and fill up that drunken belly of yours."
4,"Alright but nothing spectacular.  I will say their vegetables especially the sprouts were fresh, but other than that, nothing stood out."
5,"This place just became a dumpster. The new staff are rude, in specific the dude with no hair on the sides go first forgot about my order and then came to my table throwing the bill on the table. Also their restrooms are stinky which I would associate to the quality of their food. It used to be an ok place to get to be just another horrid place in Shattuck avenue. Not even an I am sorry came from them."
6,"I liked their food, but service is not really good. I felt abandoned by servers her two different times."
7,"Sucks , place use to be really good. I get chicken pad see ew every time I've come and the last two times I've came it's been more then underwhelming. Last time it was mushy but I figured it was a bad batch. This time it had no flavor so I sent it back ( bit a carrot to make sure he wasn't going to give me the same plate of food back re tossed) low and behold .... they did ... the same plate of food I sent back they re cooked and added sauce. I worked in food once upon a time and I'm pretty sure that's GROSS for many reasons."
8,"One of my to-go places since it is only half block away from my apartment. I tend to get a simple dinner plate every now and then.I have tried most of their entrees over the years. I am not a big fan of their pad thai or fried rice, since for the price I pay I expect more food. In the meantime, I do like their salads, specifically the lemongrass chicken salad and the beef salad. Both of them have plenty of fresh vegetables with authentic thai spices such as basil, ginger, etc.. I can imagine that to some people these salads are a little exotic, while I enjoy the freshness very much.I rarely dined in but it does have a nice setup, with lots of traditional decorations as well as several TVs. I really hope they can lower down their prices a little bit then I will come here more often."
9,"After three times being here, I feel that the restaurant has a good ambience but the service and the foods, even though are not bad, are not at the top of the class.Their pad thai is very good, and other noddles good. However, they need to improve their service."
10,"The last time I ate here was like 6 years ago before I knew decent Thai food. Today, my boyfriend stumbled upon this restaurant and wanted to dine here since it was kind of inbetween what we both wanted out of a meal. I ordered the pad see ew and the bf ordered some sort of eggplant dish with tom yum soup as an appetizer.The tom yum soup was extremely sour but I don't know if that's how it's supposed to be. It was just too sour for me although the mushrooms were the delicious. I quite enjoyed the eggplant. The pad see ew was decent although definitely not the best. I wouldn't say this place is great Thai food but it hits the spot.The service here is meh. They don't seem to care much for their job or helping a customer out if they can't decide. Would I recommend this place? Meh. But it was a quick spot to eat some Thai food. Can't complain too much."
11,"ahaha walking down Shattuck looking for the medical club and I stumbled upon Tuk Tuk Thai! Reading the name, I thought it was pretty cool and unique that it was called Tuk Tuk Thai as if they were saying ""Duck Duck Goose"" so i walked in and asked for the menu before making my stop! Was I glad i made that little pit stop, other than Imm Thai, Tuk Tuk Thai is another place that still offers really good Thai food in their restaurant. FOOD:I've only had the Pad Thai here though, and It wasn't to greasy or to oily at all like other Pad Thais offered at other Thai Restaurants. They give you so much meat rather its chicken or beef, which is really cool you need that protein! LOCATION: Not in the best location on Shattuck, its away from everything but its a really nice restaurant once you walked inside. You just probably won't notice it unless youre walking, been here before, or youre really on the look out for Tuk Tuk!Other than that, I recommend this Thai restaurant, for those who really enjoy trying new food, and for those who really just love Thai food like I do!"
12,"I waited 15mins for the hot and sour soup. It looks like home food, which means not fancy and even make me a little bit disappointed. It taste good at the first bite, but the noodles on the side is saggy. Overall, fair taste, bad service, dinning environment is not bad."
13,"After giving them a second try, I won't be back to Tuk Tuk Thai. The service is on the slow side and the food is just so so. With so many great options for Thai, I can't recommend them."
14,Been here a few times since it's nearby. It's convenient but prices are a little high for the quality and amount of food you get. Service is okay and it's never crowded unlike Imm Thai. The thai fried rice with breaded chicken is pretty good though. But I'd save my money and go to Imm which is much better taste and quality.
15,"I've been coming here for years, and sometimes it's a hit or miss with their service.The food is generally pretty tasty here, but I've noticed that the wait for your meal to come out is ridiculously long. Last night we waited a good 30 minutes before our food arrived. I wasn't my normal starving self, so I didn't put up a RBF or go up to them to complain (but they did apologize on their own). On the plus side, they're conveniently located, open late and friendly (for the most part). My usual go to's are the tom yum soup, tom kha soup and pad khi mao. Added plus, if you check in you get a Thai ice tea for $1."
16,Location is a little farther from campus than other thai places. This is my go to place along with Imm Thai. Ambiance: I really enjoy coming here since it it's a huge place with open windows. They have a tuk tuk model in the restaurant as well hence the name. Service: Our waiter was very attentive and always made sure our waters were refilled (it's a peeve of mine when they never refill them). Staff in general is always very friendly whenever I come.Food: I usually go back and forth between the pad thai and pad see ew. They're always consistent and i've been a customer for years. I find both dishes very tasty and filling. Can;t go wrong with the thai tea as well!
17,"Came here for an early dinner. Food was ok. Got the tom kha soup and the chicken was chewy and over cooked.I also checked in on Yelp to get the $1 Thai tea deal. When I realized I could use it and told the server, she came back upset and said, next time, tell your server!""  Wow... so rude and unnecessary. Won't return. There are too many gems in Berkeley - don't come here"
18,"I miss the amazing Thai places I had at my fingertips living in Hillcrest in San Diego, but when a Thai craving just won't go away and you need your fix at 10pm on a Friday night, Tuk Tuk is there for you as the only Thai place around open past 10 (and that you can get delivery through Eat24).I ordered two things via Eat24 delivery: tom kha soup with added shrimp and then the yellow curry with jasmine rice. I very shortly after got a phone call from the restaurant asking what kind of protein I wanted in my curry - the menu on Eat24 only lists chicken as an option so I assumed that was the only option. I explained that and said I'm find with chicken. I was then told it would be about an hour for delivery.Cut to a half hour later, I've been trying to get the Uber app to load the entire time and I'm worrying I won't get to the house I have the food being delivered to in time. I finally got the app to load and I have a ride coming. At this point, I get another call, this time from the delivery driver saying he's at the house. Frustrated, I explain that I was told it would be an hour and it's barely been 30 minutes at this point. The driver is annoyed so I told him to just leave the food on the porch since I paid via Android Pay.Luckily, the food wasn't cold when I got there, I didn't need to heat it up at all but I don't need my food super hot.The soup was all right, not the best tom kha I've had but it was sweet with a little sour and overall a nice, comforting, creamy soup. The stuff in it though, I wasn't too happy with. It was just tons and tons of mushrooms, way more than I usually see in a tom kha. Also, I'd requested it be made with chicken and then paid an extra $3 for shrimp; the soup was made with seafood (it looked like a breaded white fish and then some squid pieces) and both were pretty gross to me. The squid was chewy and the breading on the fish was mushy and tasteless. I threw away all of those pieces. There were two total shrimps in the soup. They were pretty big and nicely cooked, but I was bummed I got no chicken, only two shrimps, and a bunch of seafood I didn't want and was grossed out by.The yellow curry was much better. There was a nice amount of vegetables and not too much of anything, and once I stirred it around I found that they weren't too skimpy on the chicken. The potatoes weren't really cooked enough in my opinion, and were kind of hard and dry. The onions, zucchini, and green beans (interesting addition to a yellow curry) were nicely cooked. I ordered the curry mild spicy and it wasn't really spicy at all which I liked a lot.The portions were good for the price, even though you have to pay $2 for rice ($2.50 if you want brown rice). Service and delivery were quick, if a little too quick for my situation. It curbed my Thai food cravings when no other restaurant in the area could."
19,Best Thai food west of the Mississippi love the pineapple fried rice and the pad Thai love the Thai tea they always give me great service good prices I like the little tuk tuk that sits inside the restaurant

I wouldn't say this place is great Thai food but it hits the spot.The service here is meh. They don't seem to care much for their job or helping a customer out if they can't decide. Would I recommend this place? Meh. But it was a quick spot to eat some Thai food. Can't complain too much."
51,"ahaha walking down Shattuck looking for the medical club and I stumbled upon Tuk Tuk Thai! Reading the name, I thought it was pretty cool and unique that it was called Tuk Tuk Thai as if they were saying ""Duck Duck Goose"" so i walked in and asked for the menu before making my stop! Was I glad i made that little pit stop, other than Imm Thai, Tuk Tuk Thai is another place that still offers really good Thai food in their restaurant. FOOD:I've only had the Pad Thai here though, and It wasn't to greasy or to oily at all like other Pad Thais offered at other Thai Restaurants. They give you so much meat rather its chicken or beef, which is really cool you need that protein! LOCATION: Not in the best location on Shattuck, its away from everything but its a really nice restaurant once you walked inside. You just probably won't notice it unless youre walking, been here before, or youre really on the look out for Tuk Tuk!Other than that, I recommend this Thai restaurant, for those who really enjoy trying new food, and for those who really just love Thai food like I do!"
52,"I waited 15mins for the hot and sour soup. It looks like home food, which means not fancy and even make me a little bit disappointed. It taste good at the first bite, but the noodles on the side is saggy. Overall, fair taste, bad service, dinning environment is not bad."
53,"After giving them a second try, I won't be back to Tuk Tuk Thai. The service is on the slow side and the food is just so so. With so many great options for Thai, I can't recommend them."
54,Been here a few times since it's nearby. It's convenient but prices are a little high for the quality and amount of food you get. Service is okay and it's never crowded unlike Imm Thai. The thai fried rice with breaded chicken is pretty good though. But I'd save my money and go to Imm which is much better taste and quality.
55,"I've been coming here for years, and sometimes it's a hit or miss with their service.The food is generally pretty tasty here, but I've noticed that the wait for your meal to come out is ridiculously long. Last night we waited a good 30 minutes before our food arrived. I wasn't my normal starving self, so I didn't put up a RBF or go up to them to complain (but they did apologize on their own). On the plus side, they're conveniently located, open late and friendly (for the most part). My usual go to's are the tom yum soup, tom kha soup and pad khi mao. Added plus, if you check in you get a Thai ice tea for $1."
56,Location is a little farther from campus than other thai places. This is my go to place along with Imm Thai. Ambiance: I really enjoy coming here since it it's a huge place with open windows. They have a tuk tuk model in the restaurant as well hence the name. Service: Our waiter was very attentive and always made sure our waters were refilled (it's a peeve of mine when they never refill them). Staff in general is always very friendly whenever I come.Food: I usually go back and forth between the pad thai and pad see ew. They're always consistent and i've been a customer for years. I find both dishes very tasty and filling. Can;t go wrong with the thai tea as well!
57,"Came here for an early dinner. Food was ok. Got the tom kha soup and the chicken was chewy and over cooked.I also checked in on Yelp to get the $1 Thai tea deal. When I realized I could use it and told the server, she came back upset and said, next time, tell your server!""  Wow... so rude and unnecessary. Won't return. There are too many gems in Berkeley - don't come here"
58,"I miss the amazing Thai places I had at my fingertips living in Hillcrest in San Diego, but when a Thai craving just won't go away and you need your fix at 10pm on a Friday night, Tuk Tuk is there for you as the only Thai place around open past 10 (and that you can get delivery through Eat24).I ordered two things via Eat24 delivery: tom kha soup with added shrimp and then the yellow curry with jasmine rice. I very shortly after got a phone call from the restaurant asking what kind of protein I wanted in my curry - the menu on Eat24 only lists chicken as an option so I assumed that was the only option. I explained that and said I'm find with chicken. I was then told it would be about an hour for delivery.Cut to a half hour later, I've been trying to get the Uber app to load the entire time and I'm worrying I won't get to the house I have the food being delivered to in time. I finally got the app to load and I have a ride coming. At this point, I get another call, this time from the delivery driver saying he's at the house. Frustrated, I explain that I was told it would be an hour and it's barely been 30 minutes at this point. The driver is annoyed so I told him to just leave the food on the porch since I paid via Android Pay.Luckily, the food wasn't cold when I got there, I didn't need to heat it up at all but I don't need my food super hot.The soup was all right, not the best tom kha I've had but it was sweet with a little sour and overall a nice, comforting, creamy soup. The stuff in it though, I wasn't too happy with. It was just tons and tons of mushrooms, way more than I usually see in a tom kha. Also, I'd requested it be made with chicken and then paid an extra $3 for shrimp; the soup was made with seafood (it looked like a breaded white fish and then some squid pieces) and both were pretty gross to me. The squid was chewy and the breading on the fish was mushy and tasteless. I threw away all of those pieces. There were two total shrimps in the soup. They were pretty big and nicely cooked, but I was bummed I got no chicken, only two shrimps, and a bunch of seafood I didn't want and was grossed out by.The yellow curry was much better. There was a nice amount of vegetables and not too much of anything, and once I stirred it around I found that they weren't too skimpy on the chicken. The potatoes weren't really cooked enough in my opinion, and were kind of hard and dry. The onions, zucchini, and green beans (interesting addition to a yellow curry) were nicely cooked. I ordered the curry mild spicy and it wasn't really spicy at all which I liked a lot.The portions were good for the price, even though you have to pay $2 for rice ($2.50 if you want brown rice). Service and delivery were quick, if a little too quick for my situation. It curbed my Thai food cravings when no other restaurant in the area could."
59,Best Thai food west of the Mississippi love the pineapple fried rice and the pad Thai love the Thai tea they always give me great service good prices I like the little tuk tuk that sits inside the restaurant
60,"Yum! One of my favorite places to grab Thai food in Berkeley. PROS(+) Awesome Food! The Pad Kee Mao here is delicious - they offer generous portions of noodles - it's not overrun with greens, and if you order protein they really put a lot of it in!(+) Perfect level of spiciness. They have sauces readily available if you would like to add extra spiciness to it. (+) Quick service! Waiters are super attentive and the food comes out in good time. (+) Spacious restaurant - always plenty of room and they spread you out so you aren't seated RIGHT next to another party. (+) Open Late! (+) The candy they give you with your check is really good. CONS(-) More casual/basic kind of place. This isn't like a fancy restaurant, or a place to ""WOW"" your date. Just good food :)"
61,"Super cheap, they don't give rice with their curry and I ordered delivery so there was nothing I could do about it. I was stuck eat curry. Without rice. Just curry.Even worse, I specifically asked the noodles not to be spicy but it's very spicy and I can't eat it. You can see all the chili they added.Sorry, I probably won't be returning unless something was done about the rice issue."
62,"I thought I would try a new delivery place, but I won't try Tuk Tuk Thai again. The noodles were pretty much a compressed brick in the container and half of the spring rolls had burst open. That would probably be fine, but I just didn't enjoy the quality or taste of the food very much."
63,"Hmm... I've been coming here for years and I've never written a review for Tuk Tuk Thai Cafe? What?! This was my first experience eating thai food from a restaurant back when I started my food adventure life so, Tuk Tuk Thai will always have a little special place in my heart especially for Pad Kee Mao as this was the cafe I was first introduced to this dish (I've only had Pad Thai at the time).The workers are very friendly and the majority of the workers are Thai. On the outside this cafe seems really small and intimate and once you enter you'll be surprise on how spacious this Thai Cafe is.Food review:Their food is pretty solid and I feel it can blow some of the other Thai-American restaurants out the water. The dishes i've had were all flavorful and cooked perfectly.The Pad Kee Mao is stir fried perfectly and have a nice hint of sweetness and full basil flavor with nice heat to the dish. Their red and yellow curries are rich and packed with flavor and the chicken wasn't overcooked at all like some Thai-American places. The beef salad is made very well and one of the best i've had with a perfect amount of rice powder and the beef being really tender. The papaya salad, although i prefer the Lao style is well done here with a slight sweetness and a nice texture from the string beans.My go to dish right now is the BBQ New York Steak which as friend introduced me to a couple years back. What i love most is they know how to cook a good steak, when i ask for medium rare, I get medium rare every time and the size of the steak is pretty large. The house made teriyaki sauce gives the meat a nice tangy flavor without drowning out the taste of the actual meat and the jues sauce is salty and mild in heat that balances out the steak perfectly. End food reviewI've always have got great customer service here parking might not be the best at certain times but, it's my go to place that's close to where I live. They have a great happy hour menu and they're open late (1:30am). If you're out and about drinking this is the perfect spot to end your night and fill up that drunken belly of yours."
64,"Alright but nothing spectacular.  I will say their vegetables especially the sprouts were fresh, but other than that, nothing stood out."
65,"This place just became a dumpster. The new staff are rude, in specific the dude with no hair on the sides go first forgot about my order and then came to my table throwing the bill on the table. Also their restrooms are stinky which I would associate to the quality of their food. It used to be an ok place to get to be just another horrid place in Shattuck avenue. Not even an I am sorry came from them."
66,"I liked their food, but service is not really good. I felt abandoned by servers her two different times."
67,"Sucks , place use to be really good. I get chicken pad see ew every time I've come and the last two times I've came it's been more then underwhelming. Last time it was mushy but I figured it was a bad batch. This time it had no flavor so I sent it back ( bit a carrot to make sure he wasn't going to give me the same plate of food back re tossed) low and behold .... they did ... the same plate of food I sent back they re cooked and added sauce. I worked in food once upon a time and I'm pretty sure that's GROSS for many reasons."
68,"One of my to-go places since it is only half block away from my apartment. I tend to get a simple dinner plate every now and then.I have tried most of their entrees over the years. I am not a big fan of their pad thai or fried rice, since for the price I pay I expect more food. In the meantime, I do like their salads, specifically the lemongrass chicken salad and the beef salad. Both of them have plenty of fresh vegetables with authentic thai spices such as basil, ginger, etc.. I can imagine that to some people these salads are a little exotic, while I enjoy the freshness very much.I rarely dined in but it does have a nice setup, with lots of traditional decorations as well as several TVs. I really hope they can lower down their prices a little bit then I will come here more often."
69,"After three times being here, I feel that the restaurant has a good ambience but the service and the foods, even though are not bad, are not at the top of the class.Their pad thai is very good, and other noddles good. However, they need to improve their service."
70,"The last time I ate here was like 6 years ago before I knew decent Thai food. Today, my boyfriend stumbled upon this restaurant and wanted to dine here since it was kind of inbetween what we both wanted out of a meal. I ordered the pad see ew and the bf ordered some sort of eggplant dish with tom yum soup as an appetizer.The tom yum soup was extremely sour but I don't know if that's how it's supposed to be.

They were pretty big and nicely cooked, but I was bummed I got no chicken, only two shrimps, and a bunch of seafood I didn't want and was grossed out by.The yellow curry was much better. There was a nice amount of vegetables and not too much of anything, and once I stirred it around I found that they weren't too skimpy on the chicken. The potatoes weren't really cooked enough in my opinion, and were kind of hard and dry. The onions, zucchini, and green beans (interesting addition to a yellow curry) were nicely cooked. I ordered the curry mild spicy and it wasn't really spicy at all which I liked a lot.The portions were good for the price, even though you have to pay $2 for rice ($2.50 if you want brown rice). Service and delivery were quick, if a little too quick for my situation. It curbed my Thai food cravings when no other restaurant in the area could."
99,Best Thai food west of the Mississippi love the pineapple fried rice and the pad Thai love the Thai tea they always give me great service good prices I like the little tuk tuk that sits inside the restaurant
100,"Yum! One of my favorite places to grab Thai food in Berkeley. PROS(+) Awesome Food! The Pad Kee Mao here is delicious - they offer generous portions of noodles - it's not overrun with greens, and if you order protein they really put a lot of it in!(+) Perfect level of spiciness. They have sauces readily available if you would like to add extra spiciness to it. (+) Quick service! Waiters are super attentive and the food comes out in good time. (+) Spacious restaurant - always plenty of room and they spread you out so you aren't seated RIGHT next to another party. (+) Open Late! (+) The candy they give you with your check is really good. CONS(-) More casual/basic kind of place. This isn't like a fancy restaurant, or a place to ""WOW"" your date. Just good food :)"
101,"Super cheap, they don't give rice with their curry and I ordered delivery so there was nothing I could do about it. I was stuck eat curry. Without rice. Just curry.Even worse, I specifically asked the noodles not to be spicy but it's very spicy and I can't eat it. You can see all the chili they added.Sorry, I probably won't be returning unless something was done about the rice issue."
102,"I thought I would try a new delivery place, but I won't try Tuk Tuk Thai again. The noodles were pretty much a compressed brick in the container and half of the spring rolls had burst open. That would probably be fine, but I just didn't enjoy the quality or taste of the food very much."
103,"Hmm... I've been coming here for years and I've never written a review for Tuk Tuk Thai Cafe? What?! This was my first experience eating thai food from a restaurant back when I started my food adventure life so, Tuk Tuk Thai will always have a little special place in my heart especially for Pad Kee Mao as this was the cafe I was first introduced to this dish (I've only had Pad Thai at the time).The workers are very friendly and the majority of the workers are Thai. On the outside this cafe seems really small and intimate and once you enter you'll be surprise on how spacious this Thai Cafe is.Food review:Their food is pretty solid and I feel it can blow some of the other Thai-American restaurants out the water. The dishes i've had were all flavorful and cooked perfectly.The Pad Kee Mao is stir fried perfectly and have a nice hint of sweetness and full basil flavor with nice heat to the dish. Their red and yellow curries are rich and packed with flavor and the chicken wasn't overcooked at all like some Thai-American places. The beef salad is made very well and one of the best i've had with a perfect amount of rice powder and the beef being really tender. The papaya salad, although i prefer the Lao style is well done here with a slight sweetness and a nice texture from the string beans.My go to dish right now is the BBQ New York Steak which as friend introduced me to a couple years back. What i love most is they know how to cook a good steak, when i ask for medium rare, I get medium rare every time and the size of the steak is pretty large. The house made teriyaki sauce gives the meat a nice tangy flavor without drowning out the taste of the actual meat and the jues sauce is salty and mild in heat that balances out the steak perfectly. End food reviewI've always have got great customer service here parking might not be the best at certain times but, it's my go to place that's close to where I live. They have a great happy hour menu and they're open late (1:30am). If you're out and about drinking this is the perfect spot to end your night and fill up that drunken belly of yours."
104,"Alright but nothing spectacular.  I will say their vegetables especially the sprouts were fresh, but other than that, nothing stood out."
105,"This place just became a dumpster. The new staff are rude, in specific the dude with no hair on the sides go first forgot about my order and then came to my table throwing the bill on the table. Also their restrooms are stinky which I would associate to the quality of their food. It used to be an ok place to get to be just another horrid place in Shattuck avenue. Not even an I am sorry came from them."
106,"I liked their food, but service is not really good. I felt abandoned by servers her two different times."
107,"Sucks , place use to be really good. I get chicken pad see ew every time I've come and the last two times I've came it's been more then underwhelming. Last time it was mushy but I figured it was a bad batch. This time it had no flavor so I sent it back ( bit a carrot to make sure he wasn't going to give me the same plate of food back re tossed) low and behold .... they did ... the same plate of food I sent back they re cooked and added sauce. I worked in food once upon a time and I'm pretty sure that's GROSS for many reasons."
108,"One of my to-go places since it is only half block away from my apartment. I tend to get a simple dinner plate every now and then.I have tried most of their entrees over the years. I am not a big fan of their pad thai or fried rice, since for the price I pay I expect more food. In the meantime, I do like their salads, specifically the lemongrass chicken salad and the beef salad. Both of them have plenty of fresh vegetables with authentic thai spices such as basil, ginger, etc.. I can imagine that to some people these salads are a little exotic, while I enjoy the freshness very much.I rarely dined in but it does have a nice setup, with lots of traditional decorations as well as several TVs. I really hope they can lower down their prices a little bit then I will come here more often."
109,"After three times being here, I feel that the restaurant has a good ambience but the service and the foods, even though are not bad, are not at the top of the class.Their pad thai is very good, and other noddles good. However, they need to improve their service."
110,"The last time I ate here was like 6 years ago before I knew decent Thai food. Today, my boyfriend stumbled upon this restaurant and wanted to dine here since it was kind of inbetween what we both wanted out of a meal. I ordered the pad see ew and the bf ordered some sort of eggplant dish with tom yum soup as an appetizer.The tom yum soup was extremely sour but I don't know if that's how it's supposed to be. It was just too sour for me although the mushrooms were the delicious. I quite enjoyed the eggplant. The pad see ew was decent although definitely not the best. I wouldn't say this place is great Thai food but it hits the spot.The service here is meh. They don't seem to care much for their job or helping a customer out if they can't decide. Would I recommend this place? Meh. But it was a quick spot to eat some Thai food. Can't complain too much."
111,"ahaha walking down Shattuck looking for the medical club and I stumbled upon Tuk Tuk Thai! Reading the name, I thought it was pretty cool and unique that it was called Tuk Tuk Thai as if they were saying ""Duck Duck Goose"" so i walked in and asked for the menu before making my stop! Was I glad i made that little pit stop, other than Imm Thai, Tuk Tuk Thai is another place that still offers really good Thai food in their restaurant. FOOD:I've only had the Pad Thai here though, and It wasn't to greasy or to oily at all like other Pad Thais offered at other Thai Restaurants. They give you so much meat rather its chicken or beef, which is really cool you need that protein! LOCATION: Not in the best location on Shattuck, its away from everything but its a really nice restaurant once you walked inside. You just probably won't notice it unless youre walking, been here before, or youre really on the look out for Tuk Tuk!Other than that, I recommend this Thai restaurant, for those who really enjoy trying new food, and for those who really just love Thai food like I do!"
112,"I waited 15mins for the hot and sour soup. It looks like home food, which means not fancy and even make me a little bit disappointed. It taste good at the first bite, but the noodles on the side is saggy. Overall, fair taste, bad service, dinning environment is not bad."
113,"After giving them a second try, I won't be back to Tuk Tuk Thai. The service is on the slow side and the food is just so so. With so many great options for Thai, I can't recommend them."
114,Been here a few times since it's nearby. It's convenient but prices are a little high for the quality and amount of food you get. Service is okay and it's never crowded unlike Imm Thai. The thai fried rice with breaded chicken is pretty good though. But I'd save my money and go to Imm which is much better taste and quality.
115,"I've been coming here for years, and sometimes it's a hit or miss with their service.The food is generally pretty tasty here, but I've noticed that the wait for your meal to come out is ridiculously long. Last night we waited a good 30 minutes before our food arrived. I wasn't my normal starving self, so I didn't put up a RBF or go up to them to complain (but they did apologize on their own). On the plus side, they're conveniently located, open late and friendly (for the most part). My usual go to's are the tom yum soup, tom kha soup and pad khi mao. Added plus, if you check in you get a Thai ice tea for $1."
116,Location is a little farther from campus than other thai places. This is my go to place along with Imm Thai. Ambiance: I really enjoy coming here since it it's a huge place with open windows. They have a tuk tuk model in the restaurant as well hence the name. Service: Our waiter was very attentive and always made sure our waters were refilled (it's a peeve of mine when they never refill them). Staff in general is always very friendly whenever I come.Food: I usually go back and forth between the pad thai and pad see ew. They're always consistent and i've been a customer for years. I find both dishes very tasty and filling. Can;t go wrong with the thai tea as well!
117,"Came here for an early dinner. Food was ok. Got the tom kha soup and the chicken was chewy and over cooked.I also checked in on Yelp to get the $1 Thai tea deal. When I realized I could use it and told the server, she came back upset and said, next time, tell your server!""  Wow... so rude and unnecessary. Won't return. There are too many gems in Berkeley - don't come here"
118,"I miss the amazing Thai places I had at my fingertips living in Hillcrest in San Diego, but when a Thai craving just won't go away and you need your fix at 10pm on a Friday night, Tuk Tuk is there for you as the only Thai place around open past 10 (and that you can get delivery through Eat24).I ordered two things via Eat24 delivery: tom kha soup with added shrimp and then the yellow curry with jasmine rice. I very shortly after got a phone call from the restaurant asking what kind of protein I wanted in my curry - the menu on Eat24 only lists chicken as an option so I assumed that was the only option. I explained that and said I'm find with chicken. I was then told it would be about an hour for delivery.Cut to a half hour later, I've been trying to get the Uber app to load the entire time and I'm worrying I won't get to the house I have the food being delivered to in time. I finally got the app to load and I have a ride coming. At this point, I get another call, this time from the delivery driver saying he's at the house. Frustrated, I explain that I was told it would be an hour and it's barely been 30 minutes at this point. The driver is annoyed so I told him to just leave the food on the porch since I paid via Android Pay.Luckily, the food wasn't cold when I got there, I didn't need to heat it up at all but I don't need my food super hot.The soup was all right, not the best tom kha I've had but it was sweet with a little sour and overall a nice, comforting, creamy soup. The stuff in it though, I wasn't too happy with. It was just tons and tons of mushrooms, way more than I usually see in a tom kha. Also, I'd requested it be made with chicken and then paid an extra $3 for shrimp; the soup was made with seafood (it looked like a breaded white fish and then some squid pieces) and both were pretty gross to me. The squid was chewy and the breading on the fish was mushy and tasteless. I threw away all of those pieces. There were two total shrimps in the soup.

148,"One of my to-go places since it is only half block away from my apartment. I tend to get a simple dinner plate every now and then.I have tried most of their entrees over the years. I am not a big fan of their pad thai or fried rice, since for the price I pay I expect more food. In the meantime, I do like their salads, specifically the lemongrass chicken salad and the beef salad. Both of them have plenty of fresh vegetables with authentic thai spices such as basil, ginger, etc.. I can imagine that to some people these salads are a little exotic, while I enjoy the freshness very much.I rarely dined in but it does have a nice setup, with lots of traditional decorations as well as several TVs. I really hope they can lower down their prices a little bit then I will come here more often."
149,"After three times being here, I feel that the restaurant has a good ambience but the service and the foods, even though are not bad, are not at the top of the class.Their pad thai is very good, and other noddles good. However, they need to improve their service."
150,"The last time I ate here was like 6 years ago before I knew decent Thai food. Today, my boyfriend stumbled upon this restaurant and wanted to dine here since it was kind of inbetween what we both wanted out of a meal. I ordered the pad see ew and the bf ordered some sort of eggplant dish with tom yum soup as an appetizer.The tom yum soup was extremely sour but I don't know if that's how it's supposed to be. It was just too sour for me although the mushrooms were the delicious. I quite enjoyed the eggplant. The pad see ew was decent although definitely not the best. I wouldn't say this place is great Thai food but it hits the spot.The service here is meh. They don't seem to care much for their job or helping a customer out if they can't decide. Would I recommend this place? Meh. But it was a quick spot to eat some Thai food. Can't complain too much."
151,"ahaha walking down Shattuck looking for the medical club and I stumbled upon Tuk Tuk Thai! Reading the name, I thought it was pretty cool and unique that it was called Tuk Tuk Thai as if they were saying ""Duck Duck Goose"" so i walked in and asked for the menu before making my stop! Was I glad i made that little pit stop, other than Imm Thai, Tuk Tuk Thai is another place that still offers really good Thai food in their restaurant. FOOD:I've only had the Pad Thai here though, and It wasn't to greasy or to oily at all like other Pad Thais offered at other Thai Restaurants. They give you so much meat rather its chicken or beef, which is really cool you need that protein! LOCATION: Not in the best location on Shattuck, its away from everything but its a really nice restaurant once you walked inside. You just probably won't notice it unless youre walking, been here before, or youre really on the look out for Tuk Tuk!Other than that, I recommend this Thai restaurant, for those who really enjoy trying new food, and for those who really just love Thai food like I do!"
152,"I waited 15mins for the hot and sour soup. It looks like home food, which means not fancy and even make me a little bit disappointed. It taste good at the first bite, but the noodles on the side is saggy. Overall, fair taste, bad service, dinning environment is not bad."
153,"After giving them a second try, I won't be back to Tuk Tuk Thai. The service is on the slow side and the food is just so so. With so many great options for Thai, I can't recommend them."
154,Been here a few times since it's nearby. It's convenient but prices are a little high for the quality and amount of food you get. Service is okay and it's never crowded unlike Imm Thai. The thai fried rice with breaded chicken is pretty good though. But I'd save my money and go to Imm which is much better taste and quality.
155,"I've been coming here for years, and sometimes it's a hit or miss with their service.The food is generally pretty tasty here, but I've noticed that the wait for your meal to come out is ridiculously long. Last night we waited a good 30 minutes before our food arrived. I wasn't my normal starving self, so I didn't put up a RBF or go up to them to complain (but they did apologize on their own). On the plus side, they're conveniently located, open late and friendly (for the most part). My usual go to's are the tom yum soup, tom kha soup and pad khi mao. Added plus, if you check in you get a Thai ice tea for $1."
156,Location is a little farther from campus than other thai places. This is my go to place along with Imm Thai. Ambiance: I really enjoy coming here since it it's a huge place with open windows. They have a tuk tuk model in the restaurant as well hence the name. Service: Our waiter was very attentive and always made sure our waters were refilled (it's a peeve of mine when they never refill them). Staff in general is always very friendly whenever I come.Food: I usually go back and forth between the pad thai and pad see ew. They're always consistent and i've been a customer for years. I find both dishes very tasty and filling. Can;t go wrong with the thai tea as well!
157,"Came here for an early dinner. Food was ok. Got the tom kha soup and the chicken was chewy and over cooked.I also checked in on Yelp to get the $1 Thai tea deal. When I realized I could use it and told the server, she came back upset and said, next time, tell your server!""  Wow... so rude and unnecessary. Won't return. There are too many gems in Berkeley - don't come here"
158,"I miss the amazing Thai places I had at my fingertips living in Hillcrest in San Diego, but when a Thai craving just won't go away and you need your fix at 10pm on a Friday night, Tuk Tuk is there for you as the only Thai place around open past 10 (and that you can get delivery through Eat24).I ordered two things via Eat24 delivery: tom kha soup with added shrimp and then the yellow curry with jasmine rice. I very shortly after got a phone call from the restaurant asking what kind of protein I wanted in my curry - the menu on Eat24 only lists chicken as an option so I assumed that was the only option. I explained that and said I'm find with chicken. I was then told it would be about an hour for delivery.Cut to a half hour later, I've been trying to get the Uber app to load the entire time and I'm worrying I won't get to the house I have the food being delivered to in time. I finally got the app to load and I have a ride coming. At this point, I get another call, this time from the delivery driver saying he's at the house. Frustrated, I explain that I was told it would be an hour and it's barely been 30 minutes at this point. The driver is annoyed so I told him to just leave the food on the porch since I paid via Android Pay.Luckily, the food wasn't cold when I got there, I didn't need to heat it up at all but I don't need my food super hot.The soup was all right, not the best tom kha I've had but it was sweet with a little sour and overall a nice, comforting, creamy soup. The stuff in it though, I wasn't too happy with. It was just tons and tons of mushrooms, way more than I usually see in a tom kha. Also, I'd requested it be made with chicken and then paid an extra $3 for shrimp; the soup was made with seafood (it looked like a breaded white fish and then some squid pieces) and both were pretty gross to me. The squid was chewy and the breading on the fish was mushy and tasteless. I threw away all of those pieces. There were two total shrimps in the soup. They were pretty big and nicely cooked, but I was bummed I got no chicken, only two shrimps, and a bunch of seafood I didn't want and was grossed out by.The yellow curry was much better. There was a nice amount of vegetables and not too much of anything, and once I stirred it around I found that they weren't too skimpy on the chicken. The potatoes weren't really cooked enough in my opinion, and were kind of hard and dry. The onions, zucchini, and green beans (interesting addition to a yellow curry) were nicely cooked. I ordered the curry mild spicy and it wasn't really spicy at all which I liked a lot.The portions were good for the price, even though you have to pay $2 for rice ($2.50 if you want brown rice). Service and delivery were quick, if a little too quick for my situation. It curbed my Thai food cravings when no other restaurant in the area could."
159,Best Thai food west of the Mississippi love the pineapple fried rice and the pad Thai love the Thai tea they always give me great service good prices I like the little tuk tuk that sits inside the restaurant
160,"Yum! One of my favorite places to grab Thai food in Berkeley. PROS(+) Awesome Food! The Pad Kee Mao here is delicious - they offer generous portions of noodles - it's not overrun with greens, and if you order protein they really put a lot of it in!(+) Perfect level of spiciness. They have sauces readily available if you would like to add extra spiciness to it. (+) Quick service! Waiters are super attentive and the food comes out in good time. (+) Spacious restaurant - always plenty of room and they spread you out so you aren't seated RIGHT next to another party. (+) Open Late! (+) The candy they give you with your check is really good. CONS(-) More casual/basic kind of place. This isn't like a fancy restaurant, or a place to ""WOW"" your date. Just good food :)"
161,"Super cheap, they don't give rice with their curry and I ordered delivery so there was nothing I could do about it. I was stuck eat curry. Without rice. Just curry.Even worse, I specifically asked the noodles not to be spicy but it's very spicy and I can't eat it. You can see all the chili they added.Sorry, I probably won't be returning unless something was done about the rice issue."
162,"I thought I would try a new delivery place, but I won't try Tuk Tuk Thai again. The noodles were pretty much a compressed brick in the container and half of the spring rolls had burst open. That would probably be fine, but I just didn't enjoy the quality or taste of the food very much."
163,"Hmm... I've been coming here for years and I've never written a review for Tuk Tuk Thai Cafe? What?! This was my first experience eating thai food from a restaurant back when I started my food adventure life so, Tuk Tuk Thai will always have a little special place in my heart especially for Pad Kee Mao as this was the cafe I was first introduced to this dish (I've only had Pad Thai at the time).The workers are very friendly and the majority of the workers are Thai. On the outside this cafe seems really small and intimate and once you enter you'll be surprise on how spacious this Thai Cafe is.Food review:Their food is pretty solid and I feel it can blow some of the other Thai-American restaurants out the water. The dishes i've had were all flavorful and cooked perfectly.The Pad Kee Mao is stir fried perfectly and have a nice hint of sweetness and full basil flavor with nice heat to the dish. Their red and yellow curries are rich and packed with flavor and the chicken wasn't overcooked at all like some Thai-American places. The beef salad is made very well and one of the best i've had with a perfect amount of rice powder and the beef being really tender. The papaya salad, although i prefer the Lao style is well done here with a slight sweetness and a nice texture from the string beans.My go to dish right now is the BBQ New York Steak which as friend introduced me to a couple years back. What i love most is they know how to cook a good steak, when i ask for medium rare, I get medium rare every time and the size of the steak is pretty large. The house made teriyaki sauce gives the meat a nice tangy flavor without drowning out the taste of the actual meat and the jues sauce is salty and mild in heat that balances out the steak perfectly. End food reviewI've always have got great customer service here parking might not be the best at certain times but, it's my go to place that's close to where I live. They have a great happy hour menu and they're open late (1:30am). If you're out and about drinking this is the perfect spot to end your night and fill up that drunken belly of yours."
164,"Alright but nothing spectacular.  I will say their vegetables especially the sprouts were fresh, but other than that, nothing stood out."
165,"This place just became a dumpster. The new staff are rude, in specific the dude with no hair on the sides go first forgot about my order and then came to my table throwing the bill on the table. Also their restrooms are stinky which I would associate to the quality of their food. It used to be an ok place to get to be just another horrid place in Shattuck avenue. Not even an I am sorry came from them."
166,"I liked their food, but service is not really good. I felt abandoned by servers her two different times."
167,"Sucks , place use to be really good. I get chicken pad see ew every time I've come and the last two times I've came it's been more then underwhelming. Last time it was mushy but I figured it was a bad batch. This time it had no flavor so I sent it back ( bit a carrot to make sure he wasn't going to give me the same plate of food back re tossed) low and behold .... they did ... the same plate of food I sent back they re cooked and added sauce.

198,"I miss the amazing Thai places I had at my fingertips living in Hillcrest in San Diego, but when a Thai craving just won't go away and you need your fix at 10pm on a Friday night, Tuk Tuk is there for you as the only Thai place around open past 10 (and that you can get delivery through Eat24).I ordered two things via Eat24 delivery: tom kha soup with added shrimp and then the yellow curry with jasmine rice. I very shortly after got a phone call from the restaurant asking what kind of protein I wanted in my curry - the menu on Eat24 only lists chicken as an option so I assumed that was the only option. I explained that and said I'm find with chicken. I was then told it would be about an hour for delivery.Cut to a half hour later, I've been trying to get the Uber app to load the entire time and I'm worrying I won't get to the house I have the food being delivered to in time. I finally got the app to load and I have a ride coming. At this point, I get another call, this time from the delivery driver saying he's at the house. Frustrated, I explain that I was told it would be an hour and it's barely been 30 minutes at this point. The driver is annoyed so I told him to just leave the food on the porch since I paid via Android Pay.Luckily, the food wasn't cold when I got there, I didn't need to heat it up at all but I don't need my food super hot.The soup was all right, not the best tom kha I've had but it was sweet with a little sour and overall a nice, comforting, creamy soup. The stuff in it though, I wasn't too happy with. It was just tons and tons of mushrooms, way more than I usually see in a tom kha. Also, I'd requested it be made with chicken and then paid an extra $3 for shrimp; the soup was made with seafood (it looked like a breaded white fish and then some squid pieces) and both were pretty gross to me. The squid was chewy and the breading on the fish was mushy and tasteless. I threw away all of those pieces. There were two total shrimps in the soup. They were pretty big and nicely cooked, but I was bummed I got no chicken, only two shrimps, and a bunch of seafood I didn't want and was grossed out by.The yellow curry was much better. There was a nice amount of vegetables and not too much of anything, and once I stirred it around I found that they weren't too skimpy on the chicken. The potatoes weren't really cooked enough in my opinion, and were kind of hard and dry. The onions, zucchini, and green beans (interesting addition to a yellow curry) were nicely cooked. I ordered the curry mild spicy and it wasn't really spicy at all which I liked a lot.The portions were good for the price, even though you have to pay $2 for rice ($2.50 if you want brown rice). Service and delivery were quick, if a little too quick for my situation. It curbed my Thai food cravings when no other restaurant in the area could."
199,Best Thai food west of the Mississippi love the pineapple fried rice and the pad Thai love the Thai tea they always give me great service good prices I like the little tuk tuk that sits inside the restaurant
200,"Yum! One of my favorite places to grab Thai food in Berkeley. PROS(+) Awesome Food! The Pad Kee Mao here is delicious - they offer generous portions of noodles - it's not overrun with greens, and if you order protein they really put a lot of it in!(+) Perfect level of spiciness. They have sauces readily available if you would like to add extra spiciness to it. (+) Quick service! Waiters are super attentive and the food comes out in good time. (+) Spacious restaurant - always plenty of room and they spread you out so you aren't seated RIGHT next to another party. (+) Open Late! (+) The candy they give you with your check is really good. CONS(-) More casual/basic kind of place. This isn't like a fancy restaurant, or a place to ""WOW"" your date. Just good food :)"
201,"Super cheap, they don't give rice with their curry and I ordered delivery so there was nothing I could do about it. I was stuck eat curry. Without rice. Just curry.Even worse, I specifically asked the noodles not to be spicy but it's very spicy and I can't eat it. You can see all the chili they added.Sorry, I probably won't be returning unless something was done about the rice issue."
202,"I thought I would try a new delivery place, but I won't try Tuk Tuk Thai again. The noodles were pretty much a compressed brick in the container and half of the spring rolls had burst open. That would probably be fine, but I just didn't enjoy the quality or taste of the food very much."
203,"Hmm... I've been coming here for years and I've never written a review for Tuk Tuk Thai Cafe? What?! This was my first experience eating thai food from a restaurant back when I started my food adventure life so, Tuk Tuk Thai will always have a little special place in my heart especially for Pad Kee Mao as this was the cafe I was first introduced to this dish (I've only had Pad Thai at the time).The workers are very friendly and the majority of the workers are Thai. On the outside this cafe seems really small and intimate and once you enter you'll be surprise on how spacious this Thai Cafe is.Food review:Their food is pretty solid and I feel it can blow some of the other Thai-American restaurants out the water. The dishes i've had were all flavorful and cooked perfectly.The Pad Kee Mao is stir fried perfectly and have a nice hint of sweetness and full basil flavor with nice heat to the dish. Their red and yellow curries are rich and packed with flavor and the chicken wasn't overcooked at all like some Thai-American places. The beef salad is made very well and one of the best i've had with a perfect amount of rice powder and the beef being really tender. The papaya salad, although i prefer the Lao style is well done here with a slight sweetness and a nice texture from the string beans.My go to dish right now is the BBQ New York Steak which as friend introduced me to a couple years back. What i love most is they know how to cook a good steak, when i ask for medium rare, I get medium rare every time and the size of the steak is pretty large. The house made teriyaki sauce gives the meat a nice tangy flavor without drowning out the taste of the actual meat and the jues sauce is salty and mild in heat that balances out the steak perfectly. End food reviewI've always have got great customer service here parking might not be the best at certain times but, it's my go to place that's close to where I live. They have a great happy hour menu and they're open late (1:30am). If you're out and about drinking this is the perfect spot to end your night and fill up that drunken belly of yours."
204,"Alright but nothing spectacular.  I will say their vegetables especially the sprouts were fresh, but other than that, nothing stood out."
205,"This place just became a dumpster. The new staff are rude, in specific the dude with no hair on the sides go first forgot about my order and then came to my table throwing the bill on the table. Also their restrooms are stinky which I would associate to the quality of their food. It used to be an ok place to get to be just another horrid place in Shattuck avenue. Not even an I am sorry came from them."
206,"I liked their food, but service is not really good. I felt abandoned by servers her two different times."
207,"Sucks , place use to be really good. I get chicken pad see ew every time I've come and the last two times I've came it's been more then underwhelming. Last time it was mushy but I figured it was a bad batch. This time it had no flavor so I sent it back ( bit a carrot to make sure he wasn't going to give me the same plate of food back re tossed) low and behold .... they did ... the same plate of food I sent back they re cooked and added sauce. I worked in food once upon a time and I'm pretty sure that's GROSS for many reasons."
208,"One of my to-go places since it is only half block away from my apartment. I tend to get a simple dinner plate every now and then.I have tried most of their entrees over the years. I am not a big fan of their pad thai or fried rice, since for the price I pay I expect more food. In the meantime, I do like their salads, specifically the lemongrass chicken salad and the beef salad. Both of them have plenty of fresh vegetables with authentic thai spices such as basil, ginger, etc.. I can imagine that to some people these salads are a little exotic, while I enjoy the freshness very much.I rarely dined in but it does have a nice setup, with lots of traditional decorations as well as several TVs. I really hope they can lower down their prices a little bit then I will come here more often."
209,"After three times being here, I feel that the restaurant has a good ambience but the service and the foods, even though are not bad, are not at the top of the class.Their pad thai is very good, and other noddles good. However, they need to improve their service."
210,"The last time I ate here was like 6 years ago before I knew decent Thai food. Today, my boyfriend stumbled upon this restaurant and wanted to dine here since it was kind of inbetween what we both wanted out of a meal. I ordered the pad see ew and the bf ordered some sort of eggplant dish with tom yum soup as an appetizer.The tom yum soup was extremely sour but I don't know if that's how it's supposed to be. It was just too sour for me although the mushrooms were the delicious. I quite enjoyed the eggplant. The pad see ew was decent although definitely not the best. I wouldn't say this place is great Thai food but it hits the spot.The service here is meh. They don't seem to care much for their job or helping a customer out if they can't decide. Would I recommend this place? Meh. But it was a quick spot to eat some Thai food. Can't complain too much."
211,"ahaha walking down Shattuck looking for the medical club and I stumbled upon Tuk Tuk Thai! Reading the name, I thought it was pretty cool and unique that it was called Tuk Tuk Thai as if they were saying ""Duck Duck Goose"" so i walked in and asked for the menu before making my stop! Was I glad i made that little pit stop, other than Imm Thai, Tuk Tuk Thai is another place that still offers really good Thai food in their restaurant. FOOD:I've only had the Pad Thai here though, and It wasn't to greasy or to oily at all like other Pad Thais offered at other Thai Restaurants. They give you so much meat rather its chicken or beef, which is really cool you need that protein! LOCATION: Not in the best location on Shattuck, its away from everything but its a really nice restaurant once you walked inside. You just probably won't notice it unless youre walking, been here before, or youre really on the look out for Tuk Tuk!Other than that, I recommend this Thai restaurant, for those who really enjoy trying new food, and for those who really just love Thai food like I do!"
212,"I waited 15mins for the hot and sour soup. It looks like home food, which means not fancy and even make me a little bit disappointed. It taste good at the first bite, but the noodles on the side is saggy. Overall, fair taste, bad service, dinning environment is not bad."
213,"After giving them a second try, I won't be back to Tuk Tuk Thai. The service is on the slow side and the food is just so so. With so many great options for Thai, I can't recommend them."
214,Been here a few times since it's nearby. It's convenient but prices are a little high for the quality and amount of food you get. Service is okay and it's never crowded unlike Imm Thai. The thai fried rice with breaded chicken is pretty good though. But I'd save my money and go to Imm which is much better taste and quality.
215,"I've been coming here for years, and sometimes it's a hit or miss with their service.The food is generally pretty tasty here, but I've noticed that the wait for your meal to come out is ridiculously long. Last night we waited a good 30 minutes before our food arrived. I wasn't my normal starving self, so I didn't put up a RBF or go up to them to complain (but they did apologize on their own). On the plus side, they're conveniently located, open late and friendly (for the most part). My usual go to's are the tom yum soup, tom kha soup and pad khi mao. Added plus, if you check in you get a Thai ice tea for $1."
216,Location is a little farther from campus than other thai places. This is my go to place along with Imm Thai. Ambiance: I really enjoy coming here since it it's a huge place with open windows. They have a tuk tuk model in the restaurant as well hence the name. Service: Our waiter was very attentive and always made sure our waters were refilled (it's a peeve of mine when they never refill them). Staff in general is always very friendly whenever I come.Food: I usually go back and forth between the pad thai and pad see ew. They're always consistent and i've been a customer for years. I find both dishes very tasty and filling. Can;t go wrong with the thai tea as well!
217,"Came here for an early dinner. Food was ok. Got the tom kha soup and the chicken was chewy and over cooked.I also checked in on Yelp to get the $1 Thai tea deal.

The house made teriyaki sauce gives the meat a nice tangy flavor without drowning out the taste of the actual meat and the jues sauce is salty and mild in heat that balances out the steak perfectly. End food reviewI've always have got great customer service here parking might not be the best at certain times but, it's my go to place that's close to where I live. They have a great happy hour menu and they're open late (1:30am). If you're out and about drinking this is the perfect spot to end your night and fill up that drunken belly of yours."
244,"Alright but nothing spectacular.  I will say their vegetables especially the sprouts were fresh, but other than that, nothing stood out."
245,"This place just became a dumpster. The new staff are rude, in specific the dude with no hair on the sides go first forgot about my order and then came to my table throwing the bill on the table. Also their restrooms are stinky which I would associate to the quality of their food. It used to be an ok place to get to be just another horrid place in Shattuck avenue. Not even an I am sorry came from them."
246,"I liked their food, but service is not really good. I felt abandoned by servers her two different times."
247,"Sucks , place use to be really good. I get chicken pad see ew every time I've come and the last two times I've came it's been more then underwhelming. Last time it was mushy but I figured it was a bad batch. This time it had no flavor so I sent it back ( bit a carrot to make sure he wasn't going to give me the same plate of food back re tossed) low and behold .... they did ... the same plate of food I sent back they re cooked and added sauce. I worked in food once upon a time and I'm pretty sure that's GROSS for many reasons."
248,"One of my to-go places since it is only half block away from my apartment. I tend to get a simple dinner plate every now and then.I have tried most of their entrees over the years. I am not a big fan of their pad thai or fried rice, since for the price I pay I expect more food. In the meantime, I do like their salads, specifically the lemongrass chicken salad and the beef salad. Both of them have plenty of fresh vegetables with authentic thai spices such as basil, ginger, etc.. I can imagine that to some people these salads are a little exotic, while I enjoy the freshness very much.I rarely dined in but it does have a nice setup, with lots of traditional decorations as well as several TVs. I really hope they can lower down their prices a little bit then I will come here more often."
249,"After three times being here, I feel that the restaurant has a good ambience but the service and the foods, even though are not bad, are not at the top of the class.Their pad thai is very good, and other noddles good. However, they need to improve their service."
250,"The last time I ate here was like 6 years ago before I knew decent Thai food. Today, my boyfriend stumbled upon this restaurant and wanted to dine here since it was kind of inbetween what we both wanted out of a meal. I ordered the pad see ew and the bf ordered some sort of eggplant dish with tom yum soup as an appetizer.The tom yum soup was extremely sour but I don't know if that's how it's supposed to be. It was just too sour for me although the mushrooms were the delicious. I quite enjoyed the eggplant. The pad see ew was decent although definitely not the best. I wouldn't say this place is great Thai food but it hits the spot.The service here is meh. They don't seem to care much for their job or helping a customer out if they can't decide. Would I recommend this place? Meh. But it was a quick spot to eat some Thai food. Can't complain too much."
251,"ahaha walking down Shattuck looking for the medical club and I stumbled upon Tuk Tuk Thai! Reading the name, I thought it was pretty cool and unique that it was called Tuk Tuk Thai as if they were saying ""Duck Duck Goose"" so i walked in and asked for the menu before making my stop! Was I glad i made that little pit stop, other than Imm Thai, Tuk Tuk Thai is another place that still offers really good Thai food in their restaurant. FOOD:I've only had the Pad Thai here though, and It wasn't to greasy or to oily at all like other Pad Thais offered at other Thai Restaurants. They give you so much meat rather its chicken or beef, which is really cool you need that protein! LOCATION: Not in the best location on Shattuck, its away from everything but its a really nice restaurant once you walked inside. You just probably won't notice it unless youre walking, been here before, or youre really on the look out for Tuk Tuk!Other than that, I recommend this Thai restaurant, for those who really enjoy trying new food, and for those who really just love Thai food like I do!"
252,"I waited 15mins for the hot and sour soup. It looks like home food, which means not fancy and even make me a little bit disappointed. It taste good at the first bite, but the noodles on the side is saggy. Overall, fair taste, bad service, dinning environment is not bad."
253,"After giving them a second try, I won't be back to Tuk Tuk Thai. The service is on the slow side and the food is just so so. With so many great options for Thai, I can't recommend them."
254,Been here a few times since it's nearby. It's convenient but prices are a little high for the quality and amount of food you get. Service is okay and it's never crowded unlike Imm Thai. The thai fried rice with breaded chicken is pretty good though. But I'd save my money and go to Imm which is much better taste and quality.
255,"I've been coming here for years, and sometimes it's a hit or miss with their service.The food is generally pretty tasty here, but I've noticed that the wait for your meal to come out is ridiculously long. Last night we waited a good 30 minutes before our food arrived. I wasn't my normal starving self, so I didn't put up a RBF or go up to them to complain (but they did apologize on their own). On the plus side, they're conveniently located, open late and friendly (for the most part). My usual go to's are the tom yum soup, tom kha soup and pad khi mao. Added plus, if you check in you get a Thai ice tea for $1."
256,Location is a little farther from campus than other thai places. This is my go to place along with Imm Thai. Ambiance: I really enjoy coming here since it it's a huge place with open windows. They have a tuk tuk model in the restaurant as well hence the name. Service: Our waiter was very attentive and always made sure our waters were refilled (it's a peeve of mine when they never refill them). Staff in general is always very friendly whenever I come.Food: I usually go back and forth between the pad thai and pad see ew. They're always consistent and i've been a customer for years. I find both dishes very tasty and filling. Can;t go wrong with the thai tea as well!
257,"Came here for an early dinner. Food was ok. Got the tom kha soup and the chicken was chewy and over cooked.I also checked in on Yelp to get the $1 Thai tea deal. When I realized I could use it and told the server, she came back upset and said, next time, tell your server!""  Wow... so rude and unnecessary. Won't return. There are too many gems in Berkeley - don't come here"
258,"I miss the amazing Thai places I had at my fingertips living in Hillcrest in San Diego, but when a Thai craving just won't go away and you need your fix at 10pm on a Friday night, Tuk Tuk is there for you as the only Thai place around open past 10 (and that you can get delivery through Eat24).I ordered two things via Eat24 delivery: tom kha soup with added shrimp and then the yellow curry with jasmine rice. I very shortly after got a phone call from the restaurant asking what kind of protein I wanted in my curry - the menu on Eat24 only lists chicken as an option so I assumed that was the only option. I explained that and said I'm find with chicken. I was then told it would be about an hour for delivery.Cut to a half hour later, I've been trying to get the Uber app to load the entire time and I'm worrying I won't get to the house I have the food being delivered to in time. I finally got the app to load and I have a ride coming. At this point, I get another call, this time from the delivery driver saying he's at the house. Frustrated, I explain that I was told it would be an hour and it's barely been 30 minutes at this point. The driver is annoyed so I told him to just leave the food on the porch since I paid via Android Pay.Luckily, the food wasn't cold when I got there, I didn't need to heat it up at all but I don't need my food super hot.The soup was all right, not the best tom kha I've had but it was sweet with a little sour and overall a nice, comforting, creamy soup. The stuff in it though, I wasn't too happy with. It was just tons and tons of mushrooms, way more than I usually see in a tom kha. Also, I'd requested it be made with chicken and then paid an extra $3 for shrimp; the soup was made with seafood (it looked like a breaded white fish and then some squid pieces) and both were pretty gross to me. The squid was chewy and the breading on the fish was mushy and tasteless. I threw away all of those pieces. There were two total shrimps in the soup. They were pretty big and nicely cooked, but I was bummed I got no chicken, only two shrimps, and a bunch of seafood I didn't want and was grossed out by.The yellow curry was much better. There was a nice amount of vegetables and not too much of anything, and once I stirred it around I found that they weren't too skimpy on the chicken. The potatoes weren't really cooked enough in my opinion, and were kind of hard and dry. The onions, zucchini, and green beans (interesting addition to a yellow curry) were nicely cooked. I ordered the curry mild spicy and it wasn't really spicy at all which I liked a lot.The portions were good for the price, even though you have to pay $2 for rice ($2.50 if you want brown rice). Service and delivery were quick, if a little too quick for my situation. It curbed my Thai food cravings when no other restaurant in the area could."
259,Best Thai food west of the Mississippi love the pineapple fried rice and the pad Thai love the Thai tea they always give me great service good prices I like the little tuk tuk that sits inside the restaurant
260,"Yum! One of my favorite places to grab Thai food in Berkeley. PROS(+) Awesome Food! The Pad Kee Mao here is delicious - they offer generous portions of noodles - it's not overrun with greens, and if you order protein they really put a lot of it in!(+) Perfect level of spiciness. They have sauces readily available if you would like to add extra spiciness to it. (+) Quick service! Waiters are super attentive and the food comes out in good time. (+) Spacious restaurant - always plenty of room and they spread you out so you aren't seated RIGHT next to another party. (+) Open Late! (+) The candy they give you with your check is really good. CONS(-) More casual/basic kind of place. This isn't like a fancy restaurant, or a place to ""WOW"" your date. Just good food :)"
261,"Super cheap, they don't give rice with their curry and I ordered delivery so there was nothing I could do about it. I was stuck eat curry. Without rice. Just curry.Even worse, I specifically asked the noodles not to be spicy but it's very spicy and I can't eat it. You can see all the chili they added.Sorry, I probably won't be returning unless something was done about the rice issue."
262,"I thought I would try a new delivery place, but I won't try Tuk Tuk Thai again. The noodles were pretty much a compressed brick in the container and half of the spring rolls had burst open. That would probably be fine, but I just didn't enjoy the quality or taste of the food very much."
263,"Hmm... I've been coming here for years and I've never written a review for Tuk Tuk Thai Cafe? What?! This was my first experience eating thai food from a restaurant back when I started my food adventure life so, Tuk Tuk Thai will always have a little special place in my heart especially for Pad Kee Mao as this was the cafe I was first introduced to this dish (I've only had Pad Thai at the time).The workers are very friendly and the majority of the workers are Thai. On the outside this cafe seems really small and intimate and once you enter you'll be surprise on how spacious this Thai Cafe is.Food review:Their food is pretty solid and I feel it can blow some of the other Thai-American restaurants out the water. The dishes i've had were all flavorful and cooked perfectly.The Pad Kee Mao is stir fried perfectly and have a nice hint of sweetness and full basil flavor with nice heat to the dish. Their red and yellow curries are rich and packed with flavor and the chicken wasn't overcooked at all like some Thai-American places. The beef salad is made very well and one of the best i've had with a perfect amount of rice powder and the beef being really tender. The papaya salad, although i prefer the Lao style is well done here with a slight sweetness and a nice texture from the string beans.My go to dish right now is the BBQ New York Steak which as friend introduced me to a couple years back.

Last night we waited a good 30 minutes before our food arrived. I wasn't my normal starving self, so I didn't put up a RBF or go up to them to complain (but they did apologize on their own). On the plus side, they're conveniently located, open late and friendly (for the most part). My usual go to's are the tom yum soup, tom kha soup and pad khi mao. Added plus, if you check in you get a Thai ice tea for $1."
296,Location is a little farther from campus than other thai places. This is my go to place along with Imm Thai. Ambiance: I really enjoy coming here since it it's a huge place with open windows. They have a tuk tuk model in the restaurant as well hence the name. Service: Our waiter was very attentive and always made sure our waters were refilled (it's a peeve of mine when they never refill them). Staff in general is always very friendly whenever I come.Food: I usually go back and forth between the pad thai and pad see ew. They're always consistent and i've been a customer for years. I find both dishes very tasty and filling. Can;t go wrong with the thai tea as well!
297,"Came here for an early dinner. Food was ok. Got the tom kha soup and the chicken was chewy and over cooked.I also checked in on Yelp to get the $1 Thai tea deal. When I realized I could use it and told the server, she came back upset and said, next time, tell your server!""  Wow... so rude and unnecessary. Won't return. There are too many gems in Berkeley - don't come here"
298,"I miss the amazing Thai places I had at my fingertips living in Hillcrest in San Diego, but when a Thai craving just won't go away and you need your fix at 10pm on a Friday night, Tuk Tuk is there for you as the only Thai place around open past 10 (and that you can get delivery through Eat24).I ordered two things via Eat24 delivery: tom kha soup with added shrimp and then the yellow curry with jasmine rice. I very shortly after got a phone call from the restaurant asking what kind of protein I wanted in my curry - the menu on Eat24 only lists chicken as an option so I assumed that was the only option. I explained that and said I'm find with chicken. I was then told it would be about an hour for delivery.Cut to a half hour later, I've been trying to get the Uber app to load the entire time and I'm worrying I won't get to the house I have the food being delivered to in time. I finally got the app to load and I have a ride coming. At this point, I get another call, this time from the delivery driver saying he's at the house. Frustrated, I explain that I was told it would be an hour and it's barely been 30 minutes at this point. The driver is annoyed so I told him to just leave the food on the porch since I paid via Android Pay.Luckily, the food wasn't cold when I got there, I didn't need to heat it up at all but I don't need my food super hot.The soup was all right, not the best tom kha I've had but it was sweet with a little sour and overall a nice, comforting, creamy soup. The stuff in it though, I wasn't too happy with. It was just tons and tons of mushrooms, way more than I usually see in a tom kha. Also, I'd requested it be made with chicken and then paid an extra $3 for shrimp; the soup was made with seafood (it looked like a breaded white fish and then some squid pieces) and both were pretty gross to me. The squid was chewy and the breading on the fish was mushy and tasteless. I threw away all of those pieces. There were two total shrimps in the soup. They were pretty big and nicely cooked, but I was bummed I got no chicken, only two shrimps, and a bunch of seafood I didn't want and was grossed out by.The yellow curry was much better. There was a nice amount of vegetables and not too much of anything, and once I stirred it around I found that they weren't too skimpy on the chicken. The potatoes weren't really cooked enough in my opinion, and were kind of hard and dry. The onions, zucchini, and green beans (interesting addition to a yellow curry) were nicely cooked. I ordered the curry mild spicy and it wasn't really spicy at all which I liked a lot.The portions were good for the price, even though you have to pay $2 for rice ($2.50 if you want brown rice). Service and delivery were quick, if a little too quick for my situation. It curbed my Thai food cravings when no other restaurant in the area could."
299,Best Thai food west of the Mississippi love the pineapple fried rice and the pad Thai love the Thai tea they always give me great service good prices I like the little tuk tuk that sits inside the restaurant
300,"Yum! One of my favorite places to grab Thai food in Berkeley. PROS(+) Awesome Food! The Pad Kee Mao here is delicious - they offer generous portions of noodles - it's not overrun with greens, and if you order protein they really put a lot of it in!(+) Perfect level of spiciness. They have sauces readily available if you would like to add extra spiciness to it. (+) Quick service! Waiters are super attentive and the food comes out in good time. (+) Spacious restaurant - always plenty of room and they spread you out so you aren't seated RIGHT next to another party. (+) Open Late! (+) The candy they give you with your check is really good. CONS(-) More casual/basic kind of place. This isn't like a fancy restaurant, or a place to ""WOW"" your date. Just good food :)"
301,"Super cheap, they don't give rice with their curry and I ordered delivery so there was nothing I could do about it. I was stuck eat curry. Without rice. Just curry.Even worse, I specifically asked the noodles not to be spicy but it's very spicy and I can't eat it. You can see all the chili they added.Sorry, I probably won't be returning unless something was done about the rice issue."
302,"I thought I would try a new delivery place, but I won't try Tuk Tuk Thai again. The noodles were pretty much a compressed brick in the container and half of the spring rolls had burst open. That would probably be fine, but I just didn't enjoy the quality or taste of the food very much."
303,"Hmm... I've been coming here for years and I've never written a review for Tuk Tuk Thai Cafe? What?! This was my first experience eating thai food from a restaurant back when I started my food adventure life so, Tuk Tuk Thai will always have a little special place in my heart especially for Pad Kee Mao as this was the cafe I was first introduced to this dish (I've only had Pad Thai at the time).The workers are very friendly and the majority of the workers are Thai. On the outside this cafe seems really small and intimate and once you enter you'll be surprise on how spacious this Thai Cafe is.Food review:Their food is pretty solid and I feel it can blow some of the other Thai-American restaurants out the water. The dishes i've had were all flavorful and cooked perfectly.The Pad Kee Mao is stir fried perfectly and have a nice hint of sweetness and full basil flavor with nice heat to the dish. Their red and yellow curries are rich and packed with flavor and the chicken wasn't overcooked at all like some Thai-American places. The beef salad is made very well and one of the best i've had with a perfect amount of rice powder and the beef being really tender. The papaya salad, although i prefer the Lao style is well done here with a slight sweetness and a nice texture from the string beans.My go to dish right now is the BBQ New York Steak which as friend introduced me to a couple years back. What i love most is they know how to cook a good steak, when i ask for medium rare, I get medium rare every time and the size of the steak is pretty large. The house made teriyaki sauce gives the meat a nice tangy flavor without drowning out the taste of the actual meat and the jues sauce is salty and mild in heat that balances out the steak perfectly. End food reviewI've always have got great customer service here parking might not be the best at certain times but, it's my go to place that's close to where I live. They have a great happy hour menu and they're open late (1:30am). If you're out and about drinking this is the perfect spot to end your night and fill up that drunken belly of yours."
304,"Alright but nothing spectacular.  I will say their vegetables especially the sprouts were fresh, but other than that, nothing stood out."
305,"This place just became a dumpster. The new staff are rude, in specific the dude with no hair on the sides go first forgot about my order and then came to my table throwing the bill on the table. Also their restrooms are stinky which I would associate to the quality of their food. It used to be an ok place to get to be just another horrid place in Shattuck avenue. Not even an I am sorry came from them."
306,"I liked their food, but service is not really good. I felt abandoned by servers her two different times."
307,"Sucks , place use to be really good. I get chicken pad see ew every time I've come and the last two times I've came it's been more then underwhelming. Last time it was mushy but I figured it was a bad batch. This time it had no flavor so I sent it back ( bit a carrot to make sure he wasn't going to give me the same plate of food back re tossed) low and behold .... they did ... the same plate of food I sent back they re cooked and added sauce. I worked in food once upon a time and I'm pretty sure that's GROSS for many reasons."
308,"One of my to-go places since it is only half block away from my apartment. I tend to get a simple dinner plate every now and then.I have tried most of their entrees over the years. I am not a big fan of their pad thai or fried rice, since for the price I pay I expect more food. In the meantime, I do like their salads, specifically the lemongrass chicken salad and the beef salad. Both of them have plenty of fresh vegetables with authentic thai spices such as basil, ginger, etc.. I can imagine that to some people these salads are a little exotic, while I enjoy the freshness very much.I rarely dined in but it does have a nice setup, with lots of traditional decorations as well as several TVs. I really hope they can lower down their prices a little bit then I will come here more often."
309,"After three times being here, I feel that the restaurant has a good ambience but the service and the foods, even though are not bad, are not at the top of the class.Their pad thai is very good, and other noddles good. However, they need to improve their service."
310,"The last time I ate here was like 6 years ago before I knew decent Thai food. Today, my boyfriend stumbled upon this restaurant and wanted to dine here since it was kind of inbetween what we both wanted out of a meal. I ordered the pad see ew and the bf ordered some sort of eggplant dish with tom yum soup as an appetizer.The tom yum soup was extremely sour but I don't know if that's how it's supposed to be. It was just too sour for me although the mushrooms were the delicious. I quite enjoyed the eggplant. The pad see ew was decent although definitely not the best. I wouldn't say this place is great Thai food but it hits the spot.The service here is meh. They don't seem to care much for their job or helping a customer out if they can't decide. Would I recommend this place? Meh. But it was a quick spot to eat some Thai food. Can't complain too much."
311,"ahaha walking down Shattuck looking for the medical club and I stumbled upon Tuk Tuk Thai! Reading the name, I thought it was pretty cool and unique that it was called Tuk Tuk Thai as if they were saying ""Duck Duck Goose"" so i walked in and asked for the menu before making my stop! Was I glad i made that little pit stop, other than Imm Thai, Tuk Tuk Thai is another place that still offers really good Thai food in their restaurant. FOOD:I've only had the Pad Thai here though, and It wasn't to greasy or to oily at all like other Pad Thais offered at other Thai Restaurants. They give you so much meat rather its chicken or beef, which is really cool you need that protein! LOCATION: Not in the best location on Shattuck, its away from everything but its a really nice restaurant once you walked inside. You just probably won't notice it unless youre walking, been here before, or youre really on the look out for Tuk Tuk!Other than that, I recommend this Thai restaurant, for those who really enjoy trying new food, and for those who really just love Thai food like I do!"
312,"I waited 15mins for the hot and sour soup. It looks like home food, which means not fancy and even make me a little bit disappointed. It taste good at the first bite, but the noodles on the side is saggy. Overall, fair taste, bad service, dinning environment is not bad."
313,"After giving them a second try, I won't be back to Tuk Tuk Thai. The service is on the slow side and the food is just so so. With so many great options for Thai, I can't recommend them."
314,Been here a few times since it's nearby. It's convenient but prices are a little high for the quality and amount of food you get. Service is okay and it's never crowded unlike Imm Thai. The thai fried rice with breaded chicken is pretty good though. But I'd save my money and go to Imm which is much better taste and quality.

342,"I thought I would try a new delivery place, but I won't try Tuk Tuk Thai again. The noodles were pretty much a compressed brick in the container and half of the spring rolls had burst open. That would probably be fine, but I just didn't enjoy the quality or taste of the food very much."
343,"Hmm... I've been coming here for years and I've never written a review for Tuk Tuk Thai Cafe? What?! This was my first experience eating thai food from a restaurant back when I started my food adventure life so, Tuk Tuk Thai will always have a little special place in my heart especially for Pad Kee Mao as this was the cafe I was first introduced to this dish (I've only had Pad Thai at the time).The workers are very friendly and the majority of the workers are Thai. On the outside this cafe seems really small and intimate and once you enter you'll be surprise on how spacious this Thai Cafe is.Food review:Their food is pretty solid and I feel it can blow some of the other Thai-American restaurants out the water. The dishes i've had were all flavorful and cooked perfectly.The Pad Kee Mao is stir fried perfectly and have a nice hint of sweetness and full basil flavor with nice heat to the dish. Their red and yellow curries are rich and packed with flavor and the chicken wasn't overcooked at all like some Thai-American places. The beef salad is made very well and one of the best i've had with a perfect amount of rice powder and the beef being really tender. The papaya salad, although i prefer the Lao style is well done here with a slight sweetness and a nice texture from the string beans.My go to dish right now is the BBQ New York Steak which as friend introduced me to a couple years back. What i love most is they know how to cook a good steak, when i ask for medium rare, I get medium rare every time and the size of the steak is pretty large. The house made teriyaki sauce gives the meat a nice tangy flavor without drowning out the taste of the actual meat and the jues sauce is salty and mild in heat that balances out the steak perfectly. End food reviewI've always have got great customer service here parking might not be the best at certain times but, it's my go to place that's close to where I live. They have a great happy hour menu and they're open late (1:30am). If you're out and about drinking this is the perfect spot to end your night and fill up that drunken belly of yours."
344,"Alright but nothing spectacular.  I will say their vegetables especially the sprouts were fresh, but other than that, nothing stood out."
345,"This place just became a dumpster. The new staff are rude, in specific the dude with no hair on the sides go first forgot about my order and then came to my table throwing the bill on the table. Also their restrooms are stinky which I would associate to the quality of their food. It used to be an ok place to get to be just another horrid place in Shattuck avenue. Not even an I am sorry came from them."
346,"I liked their food, but service is not really good. I felt abandoned by servers her two different times."
347,"Sucks , place use to be really good. I get chicken pad see ew every time I've come and the last two times I've came it's been more then underwhelming. Last time it was mushy but I figured it was a bad batch. This time it had no flavor so I sent it back ( bit a carrot to make sure he wasn't going to give me the same plate of food back re tossed) low and behold .... they did ... the same plate of food I sent back they re cooked and added sauce. I worked in food once upon a time and I'm pretty sure that's GROSS for many reasons."
348,"One of my to-go places since it is only half block away from my apartment. I tend to get a simple dinner plate every now and then.I have tried most of their entrees over the years. I am not a big fan of their pad thai or fried rice, since for the price I pay I expect more food. In the meantime, I do like their salads, specifically the lemongrass chicken salad and the beef salad. Both of them have plenty of fresh vegetables with authentic thai spices such as basil, ginger, etc.. I can imagine that to some people these salads are a little exotic, while I enjoy the freshness very much.I rarely dined in but it does have a nice setup, with lots of traditional decorations as well as several TVs. I really hope they can lower down their prices a little bit then I will come here more often."
349,"After three times being here, I feel that the restaurant has a good ambience but the service and the foods, even though are not bad, are not at the top of the class.Their pad thai is very good, and other noddles good. However, they need to improve their service."
350,"The last time I ate here was like 6 years ago before I knew decent Thai food. Today, my boyfriend stumbled upon this restaurant and wanted to dine here since it was kind of inbetween what we both wanted out of a meal. I ordered the pad see ew and the bf ordered some sort of eggplant dish with tom yum soup as an appetizer.The tom yum soup was extremely sour but I don't know if that's how it's supposed to be. It was just too sour for me although the mushrooms were the delicious. I quite enjoyed the eggplant. The pad see ew was decent although definitely not the best. I wouldn't say this place is great Thai food but it hits the spot.The service here is meh. They don't seem to care much for their job or helping a customer out if they can't decide. Would I recommend this place? Meh. But it was a quick spot to eat some Thai food. Can't complain too much."
351,"ahaha walking down Shattuck looking for the medical club and I stumbled upon Tuk Tuk Thai! Reading the name, I thought it was pretty cool and unique that it was called Tuk Tuk Thai as if they were saying ""Duck Duck Goose"" so i walked in and asked for the menu before making my stop! Was I glad i made that little pit stop, other than Imm Thai, Tuk Tuk Thai is another place that still offers really good Thai food in their restaurant. FOOD:I've only had the Pad Thai here though, and It wasn't to greasy or to oily at all like other Pad Thais offered at other Thai Restaurants. They give you so much meat rather its chicken or beef, which is really cool you need that protein! LOCATION: Not in the best location on Shattuck, its away from everything but its a really nice restaurant once you walked inside. You just probably won't notice it unless youre walking, been here before, or youre really on the look out for Tuk Tuk!Other than that, I recommend this Thai restaurant, for those who really enjoy trying new food, and for those who really just love Thai food like I do!"
352,"I waited 15mins for the hot and sour soup. It looks like home food, which means not fancy and even make me a little bit disappointed. It taste good at the first bite, but the noodles on the side is saggy. Overall, fair taste, bad service, dinning environment is not bad."
353,"After giving them a second try, I won't be back to Tuk Tuk Thai. The service is on the slow side and the food is just so so. With so many great options for Thai, I can't recommend them."
354,Been here a few times since it's nearby. It's convenient but prices are a little high for the quality and amount of food you get. Service is okay and it's never crowded unlike Imm Thai. The thai fried rice with breaded chicken is pretty good though. But I'd save my money and go to Imm which is much better taste and quality.
355,"I've been coming here for years, and sometimes it's a hit or miss with their service.The food is generally pretty tasty here, but I've noticed that the wait for your meal to come out is ridiculously long. Last night we waited a good 30 minutes before our food arrived. I wasn't my normal starving self, so I didn't put up a RBF or go up to them to complain (but they did apologize on their own). On the plus side, they're conveniently located, open late and friendly (for the most part). My usual go to's are the tom yum soup, tom kha soup and pad khi mao. Added plus, if you check in you get a Thai ice tea for $1."
356,Location is a little farther from campus than other thai places. This is my go to place along with Imm Thai. Ambiance: I really enjoy coming here since it it's a huge place with open windows. They have a tuk tuk model in the restaurant as well hence the name. Service: Our waiter was very attentive and always made sure our waters were refilled (it's a peeve of mine when they never refill them). Staff in general is always very friendly whenever I come.Food: I usually go back and forth between the pad thai and pad see ew. They're always consistent and i've been a customer for years. I find both dishes very tasty and filling. Can;t go wrong with the thai tea as well!
357,"Came here for an early dinner. Food was ok. Got the tom kha soup and the chicken was chewy and over cooked.I also checked in on Yelp to get the $1 Thai tea deal. When I realized I could use it and told the server, she came back upset and said, next time, tell your server!""  Wow... so rude and unnecessary. Won't return. There are too many gems in Berkeley - don't come here"
358,"I miss the amazing Thai places I had at my fingertips living in Hillcrest in San Diego, but when a Thai craving just won't go away and you need your fix at 10pm on a Friday night, Tuk Tuk is there for you as the only Thai place around open past 10 (and that you can get delivery through Eat24).I ordered two things via Eat24 delivery: tom kha soup with added shrimp and then the yellow curry with jasmine rice. I very shortly after got a phone call from the restaurant asking what kind of protein I wanted in my curry - the menu on Eat24 only lists chicken as an option so I assumed that was the only option. I explained that and said I'm find with chicken. I was then told it would be about an hour for delivery.Cut to a half hour later, I've been trying to get the Uber app to load the entire time and I'm worrying I won't get to the house I have the food being delivered to in time. I finally got the app to load and I have a ride coming. At this point, I get another call, this time from the delivery driver saying he's at the house. Frustrated, I explain that I was told it would be an hour and it's barely been 30 minutes at this point. The driver is annoyed so I told him to just leave the food on the porch since I paid via Android Pay.Luckily, the food wasn't cold when I got there, I didn't need to heat it up at all but I don't need my food super hot.The soup was all right, not the best tom kha I've had but it was sweet with a little sour and overall a nice, comforting, creamy soup. The stuff in it though, I wasn't too happy with. It was just tons and tons of mushrooms, way more than I usually see in a tom kha. Also, I'd requested it be made with chicken and then paid an extra $3 for shrimp; the soup was made with seafood (it looked like a breaded white fish and then some squid pieces) and both were pretty gross to me. The squid was chewy and the breading on the fish was mushy and tasteless. I threw away all of those pieces. There were two total shrimps in the soup. They were pretty big and nicely cooked, but I was bummed I got no chicken, only two shrimps, and a bunch of seafood I didn't want and was grossed out by.The yellow curry was much better. There was a nice amount of vegetables and not too much of anything, and once I stirred it around I found that they weren't too skimpy on the chicken. The potatoes weren't really cooked enough in my opinion, and were kind of hard and dry. The onions, zucchini, and green beans (interesting addition to a yellow curry) were nicely cooked. I ordered the curry mild spicy and it wasn't really spicy at all which I liked a lot.The portions were good for the price, even though you have to pay $2 for rice ($2.50 if you want brown rice). Service and delivery were quick, if a little too quick for my situation. It curbed my Thai food cravings when no other restaurant in the area could."
359,Best Thai food west of the Mississippi love the pineapple fried rice and the pad Thai love the Thai tea they always give me great service good prices I like the little tuk tuk that sits inside the restaurant
360,"Yum! One of my favorite places to grab Thai food in Berkeley. PROS(+) Awesome Food! The Pad Kee Mao here is delicious - they offer generous portions of noodles - it's not overrun with greens, and if you order protein they really put a lot of it in!(+) Perfect level of spiciness. They have sauces readily available if you would like to add extra spiciness to it. (+) Quick service! Waiters are super attentive and the food comes out in good time. (+) Spacious restaurant - always plenty of room and they spread you out so you aren't seated RIGHT next to another party. (+) Open Late! (+) The candy they give you with your check is really good. CONS(-) More casual/basic kind of place. This isn't like a fancy restaurant, or a place to ""WOW"" your date. Just good food :)"
361,"Super cheap, they don't give rice with their curry and I ordered delivery so there was nothing I could do about it. I was stuck eat curry. Without rice. Just curry.Even worse, I specifically asked the noodles not to be spicy but it's very spicy and I can't eat it. You can see all the chili they added.Sorry, I probably won't be returning unless something was done about the rice issue."
362,"I thought I would try a new delivery place, but I won't try Tuk Tuk Thai again. The noodles were pretty much a compressed brick in the container and half of the spring rolls had burst open. That would probably be fine, but I just didn't enjoy the quality or taste of the food very much."

FOOD:I've only had the Pad Thai here though, and It wasn't to greasy or to oily at all like other Pad Thais offered at other Thai Restaurants. They give you so much meat rather its chicken or beef, which is really cool you need that protein! LOCATION: Not in the best location on Shattuck, its away from everything but its a really nice restaurant once you walked inside. You just probably won't notice it unless youre walking, been here before, or youre really on the look out for Tuk Tuk!Other than that, I recommend this Thai restaurant, for those who really enjoy trying new food, and for those who really just love Thai food like I do!"
392,"I waited 15mins for the hot and sour soup. It looks like home food, which means not fancy and even make me a little bit disappointed. It taste good at the first bite, but the noodles on the side is saggy. Overall, fair taste, bad service, dinning environment is not bad."
393,"After giving them a second try, I won't be back to Tuk Tuk Thai. The service is on the slow side and the food is just so so. With so many great options for Thai, I can't recommend them."
394,Been here a few times since it's nearby. It's convenient but prices are a little high for the quality and amount of food you get. Service is okay and it's never crowded unlike Imm Thai. The thai fried rice with breaded chicken is pretty good though. But I'd save my money and go to Imm which is much better taste and quality.
395,"I've been coming here for years, and sometimes it's a hit or miss with their service.The food is generally pretty tasty here, but I've noticed that the wait for your meal to come out is ridiculously long. Last night we waited a good 30 minutes before our food arrived. I wasn't my normal starving self, so I didn't put up a RBF or go up to them to complain (but they did apologize on their own). On the plus side, they're conveniently located, open late and friendly (for the most part). My usual go to's are the tom yum soup, tom kha soup and pad khi mao. Added plus, if you check in you get a Thai ice tea for $1."
396,Location is a little farther from campus than other thai places. This is my go to place along with Imm Thai. Ambiance: I really enjoy coming here since it it's a huge place with open windows. They have a tuk tuk model in the restaurant as well hence the name. Service: Our waiter was very attentive and always made sure our waters were refilled (it's a peeve of mine when they never refill them). Staff in general is always very friendly whenever I come.Food: I usually go back and forth between the pad thai and pad see ew. They're always consistent and i've been a customer for years. I find both dishes very tasty and filling. Can;t go wrong with the thai tea as well!
397,"Came here for an early dinner. Food was ok. Got the tom kha soup and the chicken was chewy and over cooked.I also checked in on Yelp to get the $1 Thai tea deal. When I realized I could use it and told the server, she came back upset and said, next time, tell your server!""  Wow... so rude and unnecessary. Won't return. There are too many gems in Berkeley - don't come here"
398,"I miss the amazing Thai places I had at my fingertips living in Hillcrest in San Diego, but when a Thai craving just won't go away and you need your fix at 10pm on a Friday night, Tuk Tuk is there for you as the only Thai place around open past 10 (and that you can get delivery through Eat24).I ordered two things via Eat24 delivery: tom kha soup with added shrimp and then the yellow curry with jasmine rice. I very shortly after got a phone call from the restaurant asking what kind of protein I wanted in my curry - the menu on Eat24 only lists chicken as an option so I assumed that was the only option. I explained that and said I'm find with chicken. I was then told it would be about an hour for delivery.Cut to a half hour later, I've been trying to get the Uber app to load the entire time and I'm worrying I won't get to the house I have the food being delivered to in time. I finally got the app to load and I have a ride coming. At this point, I get another call, this time from the delivery driver saying he's at the house. Frustrated, I explain that I was told it would be an hour and it's barely been 30 minutes at this point. The driver is annoyed so I told him to just leave the food on the porch since I paid via Android Pay.Luckily, the food wasn't cold when I got there, I didn't need to heat it up at all but I don't need my food super hot.The soup was all right, not the best tom kha I've had but it was sweet with a little sour and overall a nice, comforting, creamy soup. The stuff in it though, I wasn't too happy with. It was just tons and tons of mushrooms, way more than I usually see in a tom kha. Also, I'd requested it be made with chicken and then paid an extra $3 for shrimp; the soup was made with seafood (it looked like a breaded white fish and then some squid pieces) and both were pretty gross to me. The squid was chewy and the breading on the fish was mushy and tasteless. I threw away all of those pieces. There were two total shrimps in the soup. They were pretty big and nicely cooked, but I was bummed I got no chicken, only two shrimps, and a bunch of seafood I didn't want and was grossed out by.The yellow curry was much better. There was a nice amount of vegetables and not too much of anything, and once I stirred it around I found that they weren't too skimpy on the chicken. The potatoes weren't really cooked enough in my opinion, and were kind of hard and dry. The onions, zucchini, and green beans (interesting addition to a yellow curry) were nicely cooked. I ordered the curry mild spicy and it wasn't really spicy at all which I liked a lot.The portions were good for the price, even though you have to pay $2 for rice ($2.50 if you want brown rice). Service and delivery were quick, if a little too quick for my situation. It curbed my Thai food cravings when no other restaurant in the area could."
399,Best Thai food west of the Mississippi love the pineapple fried rice and the pad Thai love the Thai tea they always give me great service good prices I like the little tuk tuk that sits inside the restaurant
400,"Yum! One of my favorite places to grab Thai food in Berkeley. PROS(+) Awesome Food! The Pad Kee Mao here is delicious - they offer generous portions of noodles - it's not overrun with greens, and if you order protein they really put a lot of it in!(+) Perfect level of spiciness. They have sauces readily available if you would like to add extra spiciness to it. (+) Quick service! Waiters are super attentive and the food comes out in good time. (+) Spacious restaurant - always plenty of room and they spread you out so you aren't seated RIGHT next to another party. (+) Open Late! (+) The candy they give you with your check is really good. CONS(-) More casual/basic kind of place. This isn't like a fancy restaurant, or a place to ""WOW"" your date. Just good food :)"
401,"Super cheap, they don't give rice with their curry and I ordered delivery so there was nothing I could do about it. I was stuck eat curry. Without rice. Just curry.Even worse, I specifically asked the noodles not to be spicy but it's very spicy and I can't eat it. You can see all the chili they added.Sorry, I probably won't be returning unless something was done about the rice issue."
402,"I thought I would try a new delivery place, but I won't try Tuk Tuk Thai again. The noodles were pretty much a compressed brick in the container and half of the spring rolls had burst open. That would probably be fine, but I just didn't enjoy the quality or taste of the food very much."
403,"Hmm... I've been coming here for years and I've never written a review for Tuk Tuk Thai Cafe? What?! This was my first experience eating thai food from a restaurant back when I started my food adventure life so, Tuk Tuk Thai will always have a little special place in my heart especially for Pad Kee Mao as this was the cafe I was first introduced to this dish (I've only had Pad Thai at the time).The workers are very friendly and the majority of the workers are Thai. On the outside this cafe seems really small and intimate and once you enter you'll be surprise on how spacious this Thai Cafe is.Food review:Their food is pretty solid and I feel it can blow some of the other Thai-American restaurants out the water. The dishes i've had were all flavorful and cooked perfectly.The Pad Kee Mao is stir fried perfectly and have a nice hint of sweetness and full basil flavor with nice heat to the dish. Their red and yellow curries are rich and packed with flavor and the chicken wasn't overcooked at all like some Thai-American places. The beef salad is made very well and one of the best i've had with a perfect amount of rice powder and the beef being really tender. The papaya salad, although i prefer the Lao style is well done here with a slight sweetness and a nice texture from the string beans.My go to dish right now is the BBQ New York Steak which as friend introduced me to a couple years back. What i love most is they know how to cook a good steak, when i ask for medium rare, I get medium rare every time and the size of the steak is pretty large. The house made teriyaki sauce gives the meat a nice tangy flavor without drowning out the taste of the actual meat and the jues sauce is salty and mild in heat that balances out the steak perfectly. End food reviewI've always have got great customer service here parking might not be the best at certain times but, it's my go to place that's close to where I live. They have a great happy hour menu and they're open late (1:30am). If you're out and about drinking this is the perfect spot to end your night and fill up that drunken belly of yours."
404,"Alright but nothing spectacular.  I will say their vegetables especially the sprouts were fresh, but other than that, nothing stood out."
405,"This place just became a dumpster. The new staff are rude, in specific the dude with no hair on the sides go first forgot about my order and then came to my table throwing the bill on the table. Also their restrooms are stinky which I would associate to the quality of their food. It used to be an ok place to get to be just another horrid place in Shattuck avenue. Not even an I am sorry came from them."
406,"I liked their food, but service is not really good. I felt abandoned by servers her two different times."
407,"Sucks , place use to be really good. I get chicken pad see ew every time I've come and the last two times I've came it's been more then underwhelming. Last time it was mushy but I figured it was a bad batch. This time it had no flavor so I sent it back ( bit a carrot to make sure he wasn't going to give me the same plate of food back re tossed) low and behold .... they did ... the same plate of food I sent back they re cooked and added sauce. I worked in food once upon a time and I'm pretty sure that's GROSS for many reasons."
408,"One of my to-go places since it is only half block away from my apartment. I tend to get a simple dinner plate every now and then.I have tried most of their entrees over the years. I am not a big fan of their pad thai or fried rice, since for the price I pay I expect more food. In the meantime, I do like their salads, specifically the lemongrass chicken salad and the beef salad. Both of them have plenty of fresh vegetables with authentic thai spices such as basil, ginger, etc.. I can imagine that to some people these salads are a little exotic, while I enjoy the freshness very much.I rarely dined in but it does have a nice setup, with lots of traditional decorations as well as several TVs. I really hope they can lower down their prices a little bit then I will come here more often."
409,"After three times being here, I feel that the restaurant has a good ambience but the service and the foods, even though are not bad, are not at the top of the class.Their pad thai is very good, and other noddles good. However, they need to improve their service."
410,"The last time I ate here was like 6 years ago before I knew decent Thai food. Today, my boyfriend stumbled upon this restaurant and wanted to dine here since it was kind of inbetween what we both wanted out of a meal. I ordered the pad see ew and the bf ordered some sort of eggplant dish with tom yum soup as an appetizer.The tom yum soup was extremely sour but I don't know if that's how it's supposed to be. It was just too sour for me although the mushrooms were the delicious. I quite enjoyed the eggplant. The pad see ew was decent although definitely not the best. I wouldn't say this place is great Thai food but it hits the spot.The service here is meh. They don't seem to care much for their job or helping a customer out if they can't decide. Would I recommend this place? Meh. But it was a quick spot to eat some Thai food. Can't complain too much."

I ordered the curry mild spicy and it wasn't really spicy at all which I liked a lot.The portions were good for the price, even though you have to pay $2 for rice ($2.50 if you want brown rice). Service and delivery were quick, if a little too quick for my situation. It curbed my Thai food cravings when no other restaurant in the area could."
439,Best Thai food west of the Mississippi love the pineapple fried rice and the pad Thai love the Thai tea they always give me great service good prices I like the little tuk tuk that sits inside the restaurant
440,"Yum! One of my favorite places to grab Thai food in Berkeley. PROS(+) Awesome Food! The Pad Kee Mao here is delicious - they offer generous portions of noodles - it's not overrun with greens, and if you order protein they really put a lot of it in!(+) Perfect level of spiciness. They have sauces readily available if you would like to add extra spiciness to it. (+) Quick service! Waiters are super attentive and the food comes out in good time. (+) Spacious restaurant - always plenty of room and they spread you out so you aren't seated RIGHT next to another party. (+) Open Late! (+) The candy they give you with your check is really good. CONS(-) More casual/basic kind of place. This isn't like a fancy restaurant, or a place to ""WOW"" your date. Just good food :)"
441,"Super cheap, they don't give rice with their curry and I ordered delivery so there was nothing I could do about it. I was stuck eat curry. Without rice. Just curry.Even worse, I specifically asked the noodles not to be spicy but it's very spicy and I can't eat it. You can see all the chili they added.Sorry, I probably won't be returning unless something was done about the rice issue."
442,"I thought I would try a new delivery place, but I won't try Tuk Tuk Thai again. The noodles were pretty much a compressed brick in the container and half of the spring rolls had burst open. That would probably be fine, but I just didn't enjoy the quality or taste of the food very much."
443,"Hmm... I've been coming here for years and I've never written a review for Tuk Tuk Thai Cafe? What?! This was my first experience eating thai food from a restaurant back when I started my food adventure life so, Tuk Tuk Thai will always have a little special place in my heart especially for Pad Kee Mao as this was the cafe I was first introduced to this dish (I've only had Pad Thai at the time).The workers are very friendly and the majority of the workers are Thai. On the outside this cafe seems really small and intimate and once you enter you'll be surprise on how spacious this Thai Cafe is.Food review:Their food is pretty solid and I feel it can blow some of the other Thai-American restaurants out the water. The dishes i've had were all flavorful and cooked perfectly.The Pad Kee Mao is stir fried perfectly and have a nice hint of sweetness and full basil flavor with nice heat to the dish. Their red and yellow curries are rich and packed with flavor and the chicken wasn't overcooked at all like some Thai-American places. The beef salad is made very well and one of the best i've had with a perfect amount of rice powder and the beef being really tender. The papaya salad, although i prefer the Lao style is well done here with a slight sweetness and a nice texture from the string beans.My go to dish right now is the BBQ New York Steak which as friend introduced me to a couple years back. What i love most is they know how to cook a good steak, when i ask for medium rare, I get medium rare every time and the size of the steak is pretty large. The house made teriyaki sauce gives the meat a nice tangy flavor without drowning out the taste of the actual meat and the jues sauce is salty and mild in heat that balances out the steak perfectly. End food reviewI've always have got great customer service here parking might not be the best at certain times but, it's my go to place that's close to where I live. They have a great happy hour menu and they're open late (1:30am). If you're out and about drinking this is the perfect spot to end your night and fill up that drunken belly of yours."
444,"Alright but nothing spectacular.  I will say their vegetables especially the sprouts were fresh, but other than that, nothing stood out."
445,"This place just became a dumpster. The new staff are rude, in specific the dude with no hair on the sides go first forgot about my order and then came to my table throwing the bill on the table. Also their restrooms are stinky which I would associate to the quality of their food. It used to be an ok place to get to be just another horrid place in Shattuck avenue. Not even an I am sorry came from them."
446,"I liked their food, but service is not really good. I felt abandoned by servers her two different times."
447,"Sucks , place use to be really good. I get chicken pad see ew every time I've come and the last two times I've came it's been more then underwhelming. Last time it was mushy but I figured it was a bad batch. This time it had no flavor so I sent it back ( bit a carrot to make sure he wasn't going to give me the same plate of food back re tossed) low and behold .... they did ... the same plate of food I sent back they re cooked and added sauce. I worked in food once upon a time and I'm pretty sure that's GROSS for many reasons."
448,"One of my to-go places since it is only half block away from my apartment. I tend to get a simple dinner plate every now and then.I have tried most of their entrees over the years. I am not a big fan of their pad thai or fried rice, since for the price I pay I expect more food. In the meantime, I do like their salads, specifically the lemongrass chicken salad and the beef salad. Both of them have plenty of fresh vegetables with authentic thai spices such as basil, ginger, etc.. I can imagine that to some people these salads are a little exotic, while I enjoy the freshness very much.I rarely dined in but it does have a nice setup, with lots of traditional decorations as well as several TVs. I really hope they can lower down their prices a little bit then I will come here more often."
449,"After three times being here, I feel that the restaurant has a good ambience but the service and the foods, even though are not bad, are not at the top of the class.Their pad thai is very good, and other noddles good. However, they need to improve their service."
450,"The last time I ate here was like 6 years ago before I knew decent Thai food. Today, my boyfriend stumbled upon this restaurant and wanted to dine here since it was kind of inbetween what we both wanted out of a meal. I ordered the pad see ew and the bf ordered some sort of eggplant dish with tom yum soup as an appetizer.The tom yum soup was extremely sour but I don't know if that's how it's supposed to be. It was just too sour for me although the mushrooms were the delicious. I quite enjoyed the eggplant. The pad see ew was decent although definitely not the best. I wouldn't say this place is great Thai food but it hits the spot.The service here is meh. They don't seem to care much for their job or helping a customer out if they can't decide. Would I recommend this place? Meh. But it was a quick spot to eat some Thai food. Can't complain too much."
451,"ahaha walking down Shattuck looking for the medical club and I stumbled upon Tuk Tuk Thai! Reading the name, I thought it was pretty cool and unique that it was called Tuk Tuk Thai as if they were saying ""Duck Duck Goose"" so i walked in and asked for the menu before making my stop! Was I glad i made that little pit stop, other than Imm Thai, Tuk Tuk Thai is another place that still offers really good Thai food in their restaurant. FOOD:I've only had the Pad Thai here though, and It wasn't to greasy or to oily at all like other Pad Thais offered at other Thai Restaurants. They give you so much meat rather its chicken or beef, which is really cool you need that protein! LOCATION: Not in the best location on Shattuck, its away from everything but its a really nice restaurant once you walked inside. You just probably won't notice it unless youre walking, been here before, or youre really on the look out for Tuk Tuk!Other than that, I recommend this Thai restaurant, for those who really enjoy trying new food, and for those who really just love Thai food like I do!"
452,"I waited 15mins for the hot and sour soup. It looks like home food, which means not fancy and even make me a little bit disappointed. It taste good at the first bite, but the noodles on the side is saggy. Overall, fair taste, bad service, dinning environment is not bad."
453,"After giving them a second try, I won't be back to Tuk Tuk Thai. The service is on the slow side and the food is just so so. With so many great options for Thai, I can't recommend them."
454,Been here a few times since it's nearby. It's convenient but prices are a little high for the quality and amount of food you get. Service is okay and it's never crowded unlike Imm Thai. The thai fried rice with breaded chicken is pretty good though. But I'd save my money and go to Imm which is much better taste and quality.
455,"I've been coming here for years, and sometimes it's a hit or miss with their service.The food is generally pretty tasty here, but I've noticed that the wait for your meal to come out is ridiculously long. Last night we waited a good 30 minutes before our food arrived. I wasn't my normal starving self, so I didn't put up a RBF or go up to them to complain (but they did apologize on their own). On the plus side, they're conveniently located, open late and friendly (for the most part). My usual go to's are the tom yum soup, tom kha soup and pad khi mao. Added plus, if you check in you get a Thai ice tea for $1."
456,Location is a little farther from campus than other thai places. This is my go to place along with Imm Thai. Ambiance: I really enjoy coming here since it it's a huge place with open windows. They have a tuk tuk model in the restaurant as well hence the name. Service: Our waiter was very attentive and always made sure our waters were refilled (it's a peeve of mine when they never refill them). Staff in general is always very friendly whenever I come.Food: I usually go back and forth between the pad thai and pad see ew. They're always consistent and i've been a customer for years. I find both dishes very tasty and filling. Can;t go wrong with the thai tea as well!
457,"Came here for an early dinner. Food was ok. Got the tom kha soup and the chicken was chewy and over cooked.I also checked in on Yelp to get the $1 Thai tea deal. When I realized I could use it and told the server, she came back upset and said, next time, tell your server!""  Wow... so rude and unnecessary. Won't return. There are too many gems in Berkeley - don't come here"
458,"I miss the amazing Thai places I had at my fingertips living in Hillcrest in San Diego, but when a Thai craving just won't go away and you need your fix at 10pm on a Friday night, Tuk Tuk is there for you as the only Thai place around open past 10 (and that you can get delivery through Eat24).I ordered two things via Eat24 delivery: tom kha soup with added shrimp and then the yellow curry with jasmine rice. I very shortly after got a phone call from the restaurant asking what kind of protein I wanted in my curry - the menu on Eat24 only lists chicken as an option so I assumed that was the only option. I explained that and said I'm find with chicken. I was then told it would be about an hour for delivery.Cut to a half hour later, I've been trying to get the Uber app to load the entire time and I'm worrying I won't get to the house I have the food being delivered to in time. I finally got the app to load and I have a ride coming. At this point, I get another call, this time from the delivery driver saying he's at the house. Frustrated, I explain that I was told it would be an hour and it's barely been 30 minutes at this point. The driver is annoyed so I told him to just leave the food on the porch since I paid via Android Pay.Luckily, the food wasn't cold when I got there, I didn't need to heat it up at all but I don't need my food super hot.The soup was all right, not the best tom kha I've had but it was sweet with a little sour and overall a nice, comforting, creamy soup. The stuff in it though, I wasn't too happy with. It was just tons and tons of mushrooms, way more than I usually see in a tom kha. Also, I'd requested it be made with chicken and then paid an extra $3 for shrimp; the soup was made with seafood (it looked like a breaded white fish and then some squid pieces) and both were pretty gross to me. The squid was chewy and the breading on the fish was mushy and tasteless. I threw away all of those pieces. There were two total shrimps in the soup. They were pretty big and nicely cooked, but I was bummed I got no chicken, only two shrimps, and a bunch of seafood I didn't want and was grossed out by.The yellow curry was much better. There was a nice amount of vegetables and not too much of anything, and once I stirred it around I found that they weren't too skimpy on the chicken. The potatoes weren't really cooked enough in my opinion, and were kind of hard and dry. The onions, zucchini, and green beans (interesting addition to a yellow curry) were nicely cooked.

I really hope they can lower down their prices a little bit then I will come here more often."
489,"After three times being here, I feel that the restaurant has a good ambience but the service and the foods, even though are not bad, are not at the top of the class.Their pad thai is very good, and other noddles good. However, they need to improve their service."
490,"The last time I ate here was like 6 years ago before I knew decent Thai food. Today, my boyfriend stumbled upon this restaurant and wanted to dine here since it was kind of inbetween what we both wanted out of a meal. I ordered the pad see ew and the bf ordered some sort of eggplant dish with tom yum soup as an appetizer.The tom yum soup was extremely sour but I don't know if that's how it's supposed to be. It was just too sour for me although the mushrooms were the delicious. I quite enjoyed the eggplant. The pad see ew was decent although definitely not the best. I wouldn't say this place is great Thai food but it hits the spot.The service here is meh. They don't seem to care much for their job or helping a customer out if they can't decide. Would I recommend this place? Meh. But it was a quick spot to eat some Thai food. Can't complain too much."
491,"ahaha walking down Shattuck looking for the medical club and I stumbled upon Tuk Tuk Thai! Reading the name, I thought it was pretty cool and unique that it was called Tuk Tuk Thai as if they were saying ""Duck Duck Goose"" so i walked in and asked for the menu before making my stop! Was I glad i made that little pit stop, other than Imm Thai, Tuk Tuk Thai is another place that still offers really good Thai food in their restaurant. FOOD:I've only had the Pad Thai here though, and It wasn't to greasy or to oily at all like other Pad Thais offered at other Thai Restaurants. They give you so much meat rather its chicken or beef, which is really cool you need that protein! LOCATION: Not in the best location on Shattuck, its away from everything but its a really nice restaurant once you walked inside. You just probably won't notice it unless youre walking, been here before, or youre really on the look out for Tuk Tuk!Other than that, I recommend this Thai restaurant, for those who really enjoy trying new food, and for those who really just love Thai food like I do!"
492,"I waited 15mins for the hot and sour soup. It looks like home food, which means not fancy and even make me a little bit disappointed. It taste good at the first bite, but the noodles on the side is saggy. Overall, fair taste, bad service, dinning environment is not bad."
493,"After giving them a second try, I won't be back to Tuk Tuk Thai. The service is on the slow side and the food is just so so. With so many great options for Thai, I can't recommend them."
494,Been here a few times since it's nearby. It's convenient but prices are a little high for the quality and amount of food you get. Service is okay and it's never crowded unlike Imm Thai. The thai fried rice with breaded chicken is pretty good though. But I'd save my money and go to Imm which is much better taste and quality.
495,"I've been coming here for years, and sometimes it's a hit or miss with their service.The food is generally pretty tasty here, but I've noticed that the wait for your meal to come out is ridiculously long. Last night we waited a good 30 minutes before our food arrived. I wasn't my normal starving self, so I didn't put up a RBF or go up to them to complain (but they did apologize on their own). On the plus side, they're conveniently located, open late and friendly (for the most part). My usual go to's are the tom yum soup, tom kha soup and pad khi mao. Added plus, if you check in you get a Thai ice tea for $1."
496,Location is a little farther from campus than other thai places. This is my go to place along with Imm Thai. Ambiance: I really enjoy coming here since it it's a huge place with open windows. They have a tuk tuk model in the restaurant as well hence the name. Service: Our waiter was very attentive and always made sure our waters were refilled (it's a peeve of mine when they never refill them). Staff in general is always very friendly whenever I come.Food: I usually go back and forth between the pad thai and pad see ew. They're always consistent and i've been a customer for years. I find both dishes very tasty and filling. Can;t go wrong with the thai tea as well!
497,"Came here for an early dinner. Food was ok. Got the tom kha soup and the chicken was chewy and over cooked.I also checked in on Yelp to get the $1 Thai tea deal. When I realized I could use it and told the server, she came back upset and said, next time, tell your server!""  Wow... so rude and unnecessary. Won't return. There are too many gems in Berkeley - don't come here"
498,"I miss the amazing Thai places I had at my fingertips living in Hillcrest in San Diego, but when a Thai craving just won't go away and you need your fix at 10pm on a Friday night, Tuk Tuk is there for you as the only Thai place around open past 10 (and that you can get delivery through Eat24).I ordered two things via Eat24 delivery: tom kha soup with added shrimp and then the yellow curry with jasmine rice. I very shortly after got a phone call from the restaurant asking what kind of protein I wanted in my curry - the menu on Eat24 only lists chicken as an option so I assumed that was the only option. I explained that and said I'm find with chicken. I was then told it would be about an hour for delivery.Cut to a half hour later, I've been trying to get the Uber app to load the entire time and I'm worrying I won't get to the house I have the food being delivered to in time. I finally got the app to load and I have a ride coming. At this point, I get another call, this time from the delivery driver saying he's at the house. Frustrated, I explain that I was told it would be an hour and it's barely been 30 minutes at this point. The driver is annoyed so I told him to just leave the food on the porch since I paid via Android Pay.Luckily, the food wasn't cold when I got there, I didn't need to heat it up at all but I don't need my food super hot.The soup was all right, not the best tom kha I've had but it was sweet with a little sour and overall a nice, comforting, creamy soup. The stuff in it though, I wasn't too happy with. It was just tons and tons of mushrooms, way more than I usually see in a tom kha. Also, I'd requested it be made with chicken and then paid an extra $3 for shrimp; the soup was made with seafood (it looked like a breaded white fish and then some squid pieces) and both were pretty gross to me. The squid was chewy and the breading on the fish was mushy and tasteless. I threw away all of those pieces. There were two total shrimps in the soup. They were pretty big and nicely cooked, but I was bummed I got no chicken, only two shrimps, and a bunch of seafood I didn't want and was grossed out by.The yellow curry was much better. There was a nice amount of vegetables and not too much of anything, and once I stirred it around I found that they weren't too skimpy on the chicken. The potatoes weren't really cooked enough in my opinion, and were kind of hard and dry. The onions, zucchini, and green beans (interesting addition to a yellow curry) were nicely cooked. I ordered the curry mild spicy and it wasn't really spicy at all which I liked a lot.The portions were good for the price, even though you have to pay $2 for rice ($2.50 if you want brown rice). Service and delivery were quick, if a little too quick for my situation. It curbed my Thai food cravings when no other restaurant in the area could."
499,Best Thai food west of the Mississippi love the pineapple fried rice and the pad Thai love the Thai tea they always give me great service good prices I like the little tuk tuk that sits inside the restaurant
500,"Yum! One of my favorite places to grab Thai food in Berkeley. PROS(+) Awesome Food! The Pad Kee Mao here is delicious - they offer generous portions of noodles - it's not overrun with greens, and if you order protein they really put a lot of it in!(+) Perfect level of spiciness. They have sauces readily available if you would like to add extra spiciness to it. (+) Quick service! Waiters are super attentive and the food comes out in good time. (+) Spacious restaurant - always plenty of room and they spread you out so you aren't seated RIGHT next to another party. (+) Open Late! (+) The candy they give you with your check is really good. CONS(-) More casual/basic kind of place. This isn't like a fancy restaurant, or a place to ""WOW"" your date. Just good food :)"
501,"Super cheap, they don't give rice with their curry and I ordered delivery so there was nothing I could do about it. I was stuck eat curry. Without rice. Just curry.Even worse, I specifically asked the noodles not to be spicy but it's very spicy and I can't eat it. You can see all the chili they added.Sorry, I probably won't be returning unless something was done about the rice issue."
502,"I thought I would try a new delivery place, but I won't try Tuk Tuk Thai again. The noodles were pretty much a compressed brick in the container and half of the spring rolls had burst open. That would probably be fine, but I just didn't enjoy the quality or taste of the food very much."
503,"Hmm... I've been coming here for years and I've never written a review for Tuk Tuk Thai Cafe? What?! This was my first experience eating thai food from a restaurant back when I started my food adventure life so, Tuk Tuk Thai will always have a little special place in my heart especially for Pad Kee Mao as this was the cafe I was first introduced to this dish (I've only had Pad Thai at the time).The workers are very friendly and the majority of the workers are Thai. On the outside this cafe seems really small and intimate and once you enter you'll be surprise on how spacious this Thai Cafe is.Food review:Their food is pretty solid and I feel it can blow some of the other Thai-American restaurants out the water. The dishes i've had were all flavorful and cooked perfectly.The Pad Kee Mao is stir fried perfectly and have a nice hint of sweetness and full basil flavor with nice heat to the dish. Their red and yellow curries are rich and packed with flavor and the chicken wasn't overcooked at all like some Thai-American places. The beef salad is made very well and one of the best i've had with a perfect amount of rice powder and the beef being really tender. The papaya salad, although i prefer the Lao style is well done here with a slight sweetness and a nice texture from the string beans.My go to dish right now is the BBQ New York Steak which as friend introduced me to a couple years back. What i love most is they know how to cook a good steak, when i ask for medium rare, I get medium rare every time and the size of the steak is pretty large. The house made teriyaki sauce gives the meat a nice tangy flavor without drowning out the taste of the actual meat and the jues sauce is salty and mild in heat that balances out the steak perfectly. End food reviewI've always have got great customer service here parking might not be the best at certain times but, it's my go to place that's close to where I live. They have a great happy hour menu and they're open late (1:30am). If you're out and about drinking this is the perfect spot to end your night and fill up that drunken belly of yours."
504,"Alright but nothing spectacular.  I will say their vegetables especially the sprouts were fresh, but other than that, nothing stood out."
505,"This place just became a dumpster. The new staff are rude, in specific the dude with no hair on the sides go first forgot about my order and then came to my table throwing the bill on the table. Also their restrooms are stinky which I would associate to the quality of their food. It used to be an ok place to get to be just another horrid place in Shattuck avenue. Not even an I am sorry came from them."
506,"I liked their food, but service is not really good. I felt abandoned by servers her two different times."
507,"Sucks , place use to be really good. I get chicken pad see ew every time I've come and the last two times I've came it's been more then underwhelming. Last time it was mushy but I figured it was a bad batch. This time it had no flavor so I sent it back ( bit a carrot to make sure he wasn't going to give me the same plate of food back re tossed) low and behold .... they did ... the same plate of food I sent back they re cooked and added sauce. I worked in food once upon a time and I'm pretty sure that's GROSS for many reasons."
508,"One of my to-go places since it is only half block away from my apartment. I tend to get a simple dinner plate every now and then.I have tried most of their entrees over the years. I am not a big fan of their pad thai or fried rice, since for the price I pay I expect more food. In the meantime, I do like their salads, specifically the lemongrass chicken salad and the beef salad. Both of them have plenty of fresh vegetables with authentic thai spices such as basil, ginger, etc.. I can imagine that to some people these salads are a little exotic, while I enjoy the freshness very much.I rarely dined in but it does have a nice setup, with lots of traditional decorations as well as several TVs. I really hope they can lower down their prices a little bit then I will come here more often."

Frustrated, I explain that I was told it would be an hour and it's barely been 30 minutes at this point. The driver is annoyed so I told him to just leave the food on the porch since I paid via Android Pay.Luckily, the food wasn't cold when I got there, I didn't need to heat it up at all but I don't need my food super hot.The soup was all right, not the best tom kha I've had but it was sweet with a little sour and overall a nice, comforting, creamy soup. The stuff in it though, I wasn't too happy with. It was just tons and tons of mushrooms, way more than I usually see in a tom kha. Also, I'd requested it be made with chicken and then paid an extra $3 for shrimp; the soup was made with seafood (it looked like a breaded white fish and then some squid pieces) and both were pretty gross to me. The squid was chewy and the breading on the fish was mushy and tasteless. I threw away all of those pieces. There were two total shrimps in the soup. They were pretty big and nicely cooked, but I was bummed I got no chicken, only two shrimps, and a bunch of seafood I didn't want and was grossed out by.The yellow curry was much better. There was a nice amount of vegetables and not too much of anything, and once I stirred it around I found that they weren't too skimpy on the chicken. The potatoes weren't really cooked enough in my opinion, and were kind of hard and dry. The onions, zucchini, and green beans (interesting addition to a yellow curry) were nicely cooked. I ordered the curry mild spicy and it wasn't really spicy at all which I liked a lot.The portions were good for the price, even though you have to pay $2 for rice ($2.50 if you want brown rice). Service and delivery were quick, if a little too quick for my situation. It curbed my Thai food cravings when no other restaurant in the area could."
539,Best Thai food west of the Mississippi love the pineapple fried rice and the pad Thai love the Thai tea they always give me great service good prices I like the little tuk tuk that sits inside the restaurant
540,"Yum! One of my favorite places to grab Thai food in Berkeley. PROS(+) Awesome Food! The Pad Kee Mao here is delicious - they offer generous portions of noodles - it's not overrun with greens, and if you order protein they really put a lot of it in!(+) Perfect level of spiciness. They have sauces readily available if you would like to add extra spiciness to it. (+) Quick service! Waiters are super attentive and the food comes out in good time. (+) Spacious restaurant - always plenty of room and they spread you out so you aren't seated RIGHT next to another party. (+) Open Late! (+) The candy they give you with your check is really good. CONS(-) More casual/basic kind of place. This isn't like a fancy restaurant, or a place to ""WOW"" your date. Just good food :)"
541,"Super cheap, they don't give rice with their curry and I ordered delivery so there was nothing I could do about it. I was stuck eat curry. Without rice. Just curry.Even worse, I specifically asked the noodles not to be spicy but it's very spicy and I can't eat it. You can see all the chili they added.Sorry, I probably won't be returning unless something was done about the rice issue."
542,"I thought I would try a new delivery place, but I won't try Tuk Tuk Thai again. The noodles were pretty much a compressed brick in the container and half of the spring rolls had burst open. That would probably be fine, but I just didn't enjoy the quality or taste of the food very much."
543,"Hmm... I've been coming here for years and I've never written a review for Tuk Tuk Thai Cafe? What?! This was my first experience eating thai food from a restaurant back when I started my food adventure life so, Tuk Tuk Thai will always have a little special place in my heart especially for Pad Kee Mao as this was the cafe I was first introduced to this dish (I've only had Pad Thai at the time).The workers are very friendly and the majority of the workers are Thai. On the outside this cafe seems really small and intimate and once you enter you'll be surprise on how spacious this Thai Cafe is.Food review:Their food is pretty solid and I feel it can blow some of the other Thai-American restaurants out the water. The dishes i've had were all flavorful and cooked perfectly.The Pad Kee Mao is stir fried perfectly and have a nice hint of sweetness and full basil flavor with nice heat to the dish. Their red and yellow curries are rich and packed with flavor and the chicken wasn't overcooked at all like some Thai-American places. The beef salad is made very well and one of the best i've had with a perfect amount of rice powder and the beef being really tender. The papaya salad, although i prefer the Lao style is well done here with a slight sweetness and a nice texture from the string beans.My go to dish right now is the BBQ New York Steak which as friend introduced me to a couple years back. What i love most is they know how to cook a good steak, when i ask for medium rare, I get medium rare every time and the size of the steak is pretty large. The house made teriyaki sauce gives the meat a nice tangy flavor without drowning out the taste of the actual meat and the jues sauce is salty and mild in heat that balances out the steak perfectly. End food reviewI've always have got great customer service here parking might not be the best at certain times but, it's my go to place that's close to where I live. They have a great happy hour menu and they're open late (1:30am). If you're out and about drinking this is the perfect spot to end your night and fill up that drunken belly of yours."
544,"Alright but nothing spectacular.  I will say their vegetables especially the sprouts were fresh, but other than that, nothing stood out."
545,"This place just became a dumpster. The new staff are rude, in specific the dude with no hair on the sides go first forgot about my order and then came to my table throwing the bill on the table. Also their restrooms are stinky which I would associate to the quality of their food. It used to be an ok place to get to be just another horrid place in Shattuck avenue. Not even an I am sorry came from them."
546,"I liked their food, but service is not really good. I felt abandoned by servers her two different times."
547,"Sucks , place use to be really good. I get chicken pad see ew every time I've come and the last two times I've came it's been more then underwhelming. Last time it was mushy but I figured it was a bad batch. This time it had no flavor so I sent it back ( bit a carrot to make sure he wasn't going to give me the same plate of food back re tossed) low and behold .... they did ... the same plate of food I sent back they re cooked and added sauce. I worked in food once upon a time and I'm pretty sure that's GROSS for many reasons."
548,"One of my to-go places since it is only half block away from my apartment. I tend to get a simple dinner plate every now and then.I have tried most of their entrees over the years. I am not a big fan of their pad thai or fried rice, since for the price I pay I expect more food. In the meantime, I do like their salads, specifically the lemongrass chicken salad and the beef salad. Both of them have plenty of fresh vegetables with authentic thai spices such as basil, ginger, etc.. I can imagine that to some people these salads are a little exotic, while I enjoy the freshness very much.I rarely dined in but it does have a nice setup, with lots of traditional decorations as well as several TVs. I really hope they can lower down their prices a little bit then I will come here more often."
549,"After three times being here, I feel that the restaurant has a good ambience but the service and the foods, even though are not bad, are not at the top of the class.Their pad thai is very good, and other noddles good. However, they need to improve their service."
550,"The last time I ate here was like 6 years ago before I knew decent Thai food. Today, my boyfriend stumbled upon this restaurant and wanted to dine here since it was kind of inbetween what we both wanted out of a meal. I ordered the pad see ew and the bf ordered some sort of eggplant dish with tom yum soup as an appetizer.The tom yum soup was extremely sour but I don't know if that's how it's supposed to be. It was just too sour for me although the mushrooms were the delicious. I quite enjoyed the eggplant. The pad see ew was decent although definitely not the best. I wouldn't say this place is great Thai food but it hits the spot.The service here is meh. They don't seem to care much for their job or helping a customer out if they can't decide. Would I recommend this place? Meh. But it was a quick spot to eat some Thai food. Can't complain too much."
551,"ahaha walking down Shattuck looking for the medical club and I stumbled upon Tuk Tuk Thai! Reading the name, I thought it was pretty cool and unique that it was called Tuk Tuk Thai as if they were saying ""Duck Duck Goose"" so i walked in and asked for the menu before making my stop! Was I glad i made that little pit stop, other than Imm Thai, Tuk Tuk Thai is another place that still offers really good Thai food in their restaurant. FOOD:I've only had the Pad Thai here though, and It wasn't to greasy or to oily at all like other Pad Thais offered at other Thai Restaurants. They give you so much meat rather its chicken or beef, which is really cool you need that protein! LOCATION: Not in the best location on Shattuck, its away from everything but its a really nice restaurant once you walked inside. You just probably won't notice it unless youre walking, been here before, or youre really on the look out for Tuk Tuk!Other than that, I recommend this Thai restaurant, for those who really enjoy trying new food, and for those who really just love Thai food like I do!"
552,"I waited 15mins for the hot and sour soup. It looks like home food, which means not fancy and even make me a little bit disappointed. It taste good at the first bite, but the noodles on the side is saggy. Overall, fair taste, bad service, dinning environment is not bad."
553,"After giving them a second try, I won't be back to Tuk Tuk Thai. The service is on the slow side and the food is just so so. With so many great options for Thai, I can't recommend them."
554,Been here a few times since it's nearby. It's convenient but prices are a little high for the quality and amount of food you get. Service is okay and it's never crowded unlike Imm Thai. The thai fried rice with breaded chicken is pretty good though. But I'd save my money and go to Imm which is much better taste and quality.
555,"I've been coming here for years, and sometimes it's a hit or miss with their service.The food is generally pretty tasty here, but I've noticed that the wait for your meal to come out is ridiculously long. Last night we waited a good 30 minutes before our food arrived. I wasn't my normal starving self, so I didn't put up a RBF or go up to them to complain (but they did apologize on their own). On the plus side, they're conveniently located, open late and friendly (for the most part). My usual go to's are the tom yum soup, tom kha soup and pad khi mao. Added plus, if you check in you get a Thai ice tea for $1."
556,Location is a little farther from campus than other thai places. This is my go to place along with Imm Thai. Ambiance: I really enjoy coming here since it it's a huge place with open windows. They have a tuk tuk model in the restaurant as well hence the name. Service: Our waiter was very attentive and always made sure our waters were refilled (it's a peeve of mine when they never refill them). Staff in general is always very friendly whenever I come.Food: I usually go back and forth between the pad thai and pad see ew. They're always consistent and i've been a customer for years. I find both dishes very tasty and filling. Can;t go wrong with the thai tea as well!
557,"Came here for an early dinner. Food was ok. Got the tom kha soup and the chicken was chewy and over cooked.I also checked in on Yelp to get the $1 Thai tea deal. When I realized I could use it and told the server, she came back upset and said, next time, tell your server!""  Wow... so rude and unnecessary. Won't return. There are too many gems in Berkeley - don't come here"
558,"I miss the amazing Thai places I had at my fingertips living in Hillcrest in San Diego, but when a Thai craving just won't go away and you need your fix at 10pm on a Friday night, Tuk Tuk is there for you as the only Thai place around open past 10 (and that you can get delivery through Eat24).I ordered two things via Eat24 delivery: tom kha soup with added shrimp and then the yellow curry with jasmine rice. I very shortly after got a phone call from the restaurant asking what kind of protein I wanted in my curry - the menu on Eat24 only lists chicken as an option so I assumed that was the only option. I explained that and said I'm find with chicken.

Also their restrooms are stinky which I would associate to the quality of their food. It used to be an ok place to get to be just another horrid place in Shattuck avenue. Not even an I am sorry came from them."
586,"I liked their food, but service is not really good. I felt abandoned by servers her two different times."
587,"Sucks , place use to be really good. I get chicken pad see ew every time I've come and the last two times I've came it's been more then underwhelming. Last time it was mushy but I figured it was a bad batch. This time it had no flavor so I sent it back ( bit a carrot to make sure he wasn't going to give me the same plate of food back re tossed) low and behold .... they did ... the same plate of food I sent back they re cooked and added sauce. I worked in food once upon a time and I'm pretty sure that's GROSS for many reasons."
588,"One of my to-go places since it is only half block away from my apartment. I tend to get a simple dinner plate every now and then.I have tried most of their entrees over the years. I am not a big fan of their pad thai or fried rice, since for the price I pay I expect more food. In the meantime, I do like their salads, specifically the lemongrass chicken salad and the beef salad. Both of them have plenty of fresh vegetables with authentic thai spices such as basil, ginger, etc.. I can imagine that to some people these salads are a little exotic, while I enjoy the freshness very much.I rarely dined in but it does have a nice setup, with lots of traditional decorations as well as several TVs. I really hope they can lower down their prices a little bit then I will come here more often."
589,"After three times being here, I feel that the restaurant has a good ambience but the service and the foods, even though are not bad, are not at the top of the class.Their pad thai is very good, and other noddles good. However, they need to improve their service."
590,"The last time I ate here was like 6 years ago before I knew decent Thai food. Today, my boyfriend stumbled upon this restaurant and wanted to dine here since it was kind of inbetween what we both wanted out of a meal. I ordered the pad see ew and the bf ordered some sort of eggplant dish with tom yum soup as an appetizer.The tom yum soup was extremely sour but I don't know if that's how it's supposed to be. It was just too sour for me although the mushrooms were the delicious. I quite enjoyed the eggplant. The pad see ew was decent although definitely not the best. I wouldn't say this place is great Thai food but it hits the spot.The service here is meh. They don't seem to care much for their job or helping a customer out if they can't decide. Would I recommend this place? Meh. But it was a quick spot to eat some Thai food. Can't complain too much."
591,"ahaha walking down Shattuck looking for the medical club and I stumbled upon Tuk Tuk Thai! Reading the name, I thought it was pretty cool and unique that it was called Tuk Tuk Thai as if they were saying ""Duck Duck Goose"" so i walked in and asked for the menu before making my stop! Was I glad i made that little pit stop, other than Imm Thai, Tuk Tuk Thai is another place that still offers really good Thai food in their restaurant. FOOD:I've only had the Pad Thai here though, and It wasn't to greasy or to oily at all like other Pad Thais offered at other Thai Restaurants. They give you so much meat rather its chicken or beef, which is really cool you need that protein! LOCATION: Not in the best location on Shattuck, its away from everything but its a really nice restaurant once you walked inside. You just probably won't notice it unless youre walking, been here before, or youre really on the look out for Tuk Tuk!Other than that, I recommend this Thai restaurant, for those who really enjoy trying new food, and for those who really just love Thai food like I do!"
592,"I waited 15mins for the hot and sour soup. It looks like home food, which means not fancy and even make me a little bit disappointed. It taste good at the first bite, but the noodles on the side is saggy. Overall, fair taste, bad service, dinning environment is not bad."
593,"After giving them a second try, I won't be back to Tuk Tuk Thai. The service is on the slow side and the food is just so so. With so many great options for Thai, I can't recommend them."
594,Been here a few times since it's nearby. It's convenient but prices are a little high for the quality and amount of food you get. Service is okay and it's never crowded unlike Imm Thai. The thai fried rice with breaded chicken is pretty good though. But I'd save my money and go to Imm which is much better taste and quality.
595,"I've been coming here for years, and sometimes it's a hit or miss with their service.The food is generally pretty tasty here, but I've noticed that the wait for your meal to come out is ridiculously long. Last night we waited a good 30 minutes before our food arrived. I wasn't my normal starving self, so I didn't put up a RBF or go up to them to complain (but they did apologize on their own). On the plus side, they're conveniently located, open late and friendly (for the most part). My usual go to's are the tom yum soup, tom kha soup and pad khi mao. Added plus, if you check in you get a Thai ice tea for $1."
596,Location is a little farther from campus than other thai places. This is my go to place along with Imm Thai. Ambiance: I really enjoy coming here since it it's a huge place with open windows. They have a tuk tuk model in the restaurant as well hence the name. Service: Our waiter was very attentive and always made sure our waters were refilled (it's a peeve of mine when they never refill them). Staff in general is always very friendly whenever I come.Food: I usually go back and forth between the pad thai and pad see ew. They're always consistent and i've been a customer for years. I find both dishes very tasty and filling. Can;t go wrong with the thai tea as well!
597,"Came here for an early dinner. Food was ok. Got the tom kha soup and the chicken was chewy and over cooked.I also checked in on Yelp to get the $1 Thai tea deal. When I realized I could use it and told the server, she came back upset and said, next time, tell your server!""  Wow... so rude and unnecessary. Won't return. There are too many gems in Berkeley - don't come here"
598,"I miss the amazing Thai places I had at my fingertips living in Hillcrest in San Diego, but when a Thai craving just won't go away and you need your fix at 10pm on a Friday night, Tuk Tuk is there for you as the only Thai place around open past 10 (and that you can get delivery through Eat24).I ordered two things via Eat24 delivery: tom kha soup with added shrimp and then the yellow curry with jasmine rice. I very shortly after got a phone call from the restaurant asking what kind of protein I wanted in my curry - the menu on Eat24 only lists chicken as an option so I assumed that was the only option. I explained that and said I'm find with chicken. I was then told it would be about an hour for delivery.Cut to a half hour later, I've been trying to get the Uber app to load the entire time and I'm worrying I won't get to the house I have the food being delivered to in time. I finally got the app to load and I have a ride coming. At this point, I get another call, this time from the delivery driver saying he's at the house. Frustrated, I explain that I was told it would be an hour and it's barely been 30 minutes at this point. The driver is annoyed so I told him to just leave the food on the porch since I paid via Android Pay.Luckily, the food wasn't cold when I got there, I didn't need to heat it up at all but I don't need my food super hot.The soup was all right, not the best tom kha I've had but it was sweet with a little sour and overall a nice, comforting, creamy soup. The stuff in it though, I wasn't too happy with. It was just tons and tons of mushrooms, way more than I usually see in a tom kha. Also, I'd requested it be made with chicken and then paid an extra $3 for shrimp; the soup was made with seafood (it looked like a breaded white fish and then some squid pieces) and both were pretty gross to me. The squid was chewy and the breading on the fish was mushy and tasteless. I threw away all of those pieces. There were two total shrimps in the soup. They were pretty big and nicely cooked, but I was bummed I got no chicken, only two shrimps, and a bunch of seafood I didn't want and was grossed out by.The yellow curry was much better. There was a nice amount of vegetables and not too much of anything, and once I stirred it around I found that they weren't too skimpy on the chicken. The potatoes weren't really cooked enough in my opinion, and were kind of hard and dry. The onions, zucchini, and green beans (interesting addition to a yellow curry) were nicely cooked. I ordered the curry mild spicy and it wasn't really spicy at all which I liked a lot.The portions were good for the price, even though you have to pay $2 for rice ($2.50 if you want brown rice). Service and delivery were quick, if a little too quick for my situation. It curbed my Thai food cravings when no other restaurant in the area could."
599,Best Thai food west of the Mississippi love the pineapple fried rice and the pad Thai love the Thai tea they always give me great service good prices I like the little tuk tuk that sits inside the restaurant
600,"Yum! One of my favorite places to grab Thai food in Berkeley. PROS(+) Awesome Food! The Pad Kee Mao here is delicious - they offer generous portions of noodles - it's not overrun with greens, and if you order protein they really put a lot of it in!(+) Perfect level of spiciness. They have sauces readily available if you would like to add extra spiciness to it. (+) Quick service! Waiters are super attentive and the food comes out in good time. (+) Spacious restaurant - always plenty of room and they spread you out so you aren't seated RIGHT next to another party. (+) Open Late! (+) The candy they give you with your check is really good. CONS(-) More casual/basic kind of place. This isn't like a fancy restaurant, or a place to ""WOW"" your date. Just good food :)"
601,"Super cheap, they don't give rice with their curry and I ordered delivery so there was nothing I could do about it. I was stuck eat curry. Without rice. Just curry.Even worse, I specifically asked the noodles not to be spicy but it's very spicy and I can't eat it. You can see all the chili they added.Sorry, I probably won't be returning unless something was done about the rice issue."
602,"I thought I would try a new delivery place, but I won't try Tuk Tuk Thai again. The noodles were pretty much a compressed brick in the container and half of the spring rolls had burst open. That would probably be fine, but I just didn't enjoy the quality or taste of the food very much."
603,"Hmm... I've been coming here for years and I've never written a review for Tuk Tuk Thai Cafe? What?! This was my first experience eating thai food from a restaurant back when I started my food adventure life so, Tuk Tuk Thai will always have a little special place in my heart especially for Pad Kee Mao as this was the cafe I was first introduced to this dish (I've only had Pad Thai at the time).The workers are very friendly and the majority of the workers are Thai. On the outside this cafe seems really small and intimate and once you enter you'll be surprise on how spacious this Thai Cafe is.Food review:Their food is pretty solid and I feel it can blow some of the other Thai-American restaurants out the water. The dishes i've had were all flavorful and cooked perfectly.The Pad Kee Mao is stir fried perfectly and have a nice hint of sweetness and full basil flavor with nice heat to the dish. Their red and yellow curries are rich and packed with flavor and the chicken wasn't overcooked at all like some Thai-American places. The beef salad is made very well and one of the best i've had with a perfect amount of rice powder and the beef being really tender. The papaya salad, although i prefer the Lao style is well done here with a slight sweetness and a nice texture from the string beans.My go to dish right now is the BBQ New York Steak which as friend introduced me to a couple years back. What i love most is they know how to cook a good steak, when i ask for medium rare, I get medium rare every time and the size of the steak is pretty large. The house made teriyaki sauce gives the meat a nice tangy flavor without drowning out the taste of the actual meat and the jues sauce is salty and mild in heat that balances out the steak perfectly. End food reviewI've always have got great customer service here parking might not be the best at certain times but, it's my go to place that's close to where I live. They have a great happy hour menu and they're open late (1:30am). If you're out and about drinking this is the perfect spot to end your night and fill up that drunken belly of yours."
604,"Alright but nothing spectacular.  I will say their vegetables especially the sprouts were fresh, but other than that, nothing stood out."
605,"This place just became a dumpster. The new staff are rude, in specific the dude with no hair on the sides go first forgot about my order and then came to my table throwing the bill on the table.

Staff in general is always very friendly whenever I come.Food: I usually go back and forth between the pad thai and pad see ew. They're always consistent and i've been a customer for years. I find both dishes very tasty and filling. Can;t go wrong with the thai tea as well!
637,"Came here for an early dinner. Food was ok. Got the tom kha soup and the chicken was chewy and over cooked.I also checked in on Yelp to get the $1 Thai tea deal. When I realized I could use it and told the server, she came back upset and said, next time, tell your server!""  Wow... so rude and unnecessary. Won't return. There are too many gems in Berkeley - don't come here"
638,"I miss the amazing Thai places I had at my fingertips living in Hillcrest in San Diego, but when a Thai craving just won't go away and you need your fix at 10pm on a Friday night, Tuk Tuk is there for you as the only Thai place around open past 10 (and that you can get delivery through Eat24).I ordered two things via Eat24 delivery: tom kha soup with added shrimp and then the yellow curry with jasmine rice. I very shortly after got a phone call from the restaurant asking what kind of protein I wanted in my curry - the menu on Eat24 only lists chicken as an option so I assumed that was the only option. I explained that and said I'm find with chicken. I was then told it would be about an hour for delivery.Cut to a half hour later, I've been trying to get the Uber app to load the entire time and I'm worrying I won't get to the house I have the food being delivered to in time. I finally got the app to load and I have a ride coming. At this point, I get another call, this time from the delivery driver saying he's at the house. Frustrated, I explain that I was told it would be an hour and it's barely been 30 minutes at this point. The driver is annoyed so I told him to just leave the food on the porch since I paid via Android Pay.Luckily, the food wasn't cold when I got there, I didn't need to heat it up at all but I don't need my food super hot.The soup was all right, not the best tom kha I've had but it was sweet with a little sour and overall a nice, comforting, creamy soup. The stuff in it though, I wasn't too happy with. It was just tons and tons of mushrooms, way more than I usually see in a tom kha. Also, I'd requested it be made with chicken and then paid an extra $3 for shrimp; the soup was made with seafood (it looked like a breaded white fish and then some squid pieces) and both were pretty gross to me. The squid was chewy and the breading on the fish was mushy and tasteless. I threw away all of those pieces. There were two total shrimps in the soup. They were pretty big and nicely cooked, but I was bummed I got no chicken, only two shrimps, and a bunch of seafood I didn't want and was grossed out by.The yellow curry was much better. There was a nice amount of vegetables and not too much of anything, and once I stirred it around I found that they weren't too skimpy on the chicken. The potatoes weren't really cooked enough in my opinion, and were kind of hard and dry. The onions, zucchini, and green beans (interesting addition to a yellow curry) were nicely cooked. I ordered the curry mild spicy and it wasn't really spicy at all which I liked a lot.The portions were good for the price, even though you have to pay $2 for rice ($2.50 if you want brown rice). Service and delivery were quick, if a little too quick for my situation. It curbed my Thai food cravings when no other restaurant in the area could."
639,Best Thai food west of the Mississippi love the pineapple fried rice and the pad Thai love the Thai tea they always give me great service good prices I like the little tuk tuk that sits inside the restaurant
640,"Yum! One of my favorite places to grab Thai food in Berkeley. PROS(+) Awesome Food! The Pad Kee Mao here is delicious - they offer generous portions of noodles - it's not overrun with greens, and if you order protein they really put a lot of it in!(+) Perfect level of spiciness. They have sauces readily available if you would like to add extra spiciness to it. (+) Quick service! Waiters are super attentive and the food comes out in good time. (+) Spacious restaurant - always plenty of room and they spread you out so you aren't seated RIGHT next to another party. (+) Open Late! (+) The candy they give you with your check is really good. CONS(-) More casual/basic kind of place. This isn't like a fancy restaurant, or a place to ""WOW"" your date. Just good food :)"
641,"Super cheap, they don't give rice with their curry and I ordered delivery so there was nothing I could do about it. I was stuck eat curry. Without rice. Just curry.Even worse, I specifically asked the noodles not to be spicy but it's very spicy and I can't eat it. You can see all the chili they added.Sorry, I probably won't be returning unless something was done about the rice issue."
642,"I thought I would try a new delivery place, but I won't try Tuk Tuk Thai again. The noodles were pretty much a compressed brick in the container and half of the spring rolls had burst open. That would probably be fine, but I just didn't enjoy the quality or taste of the food very much."
643,"Hmm... I've been coming here for years and I've never written a review for Tuk Tuk Thai Cafe? What?! This was my first experience eating thai food from a restaurant back when I started my food adventure life so, Tuk Tuk Thai will always have a little special place in my heart especially for Pad Kee Mao as this was the cafe I was first introduced to this dish (I've only had Pad Thai at the time).The workers are very friendly and the majority of the workers are Thai. On the outside this cafe seems really small and intimate and once you enter you'll be surprise on how spacious this Thai Cafe is.Food review:Their food is pretty solid and I feel it can blow some of the other Thai-American restaurants out the water. The dishes i've had were all flavorful and cooked perfectly.The Pad Kee Mao is stir fried perfectly and have a nice hint of sweetness and full basil flavor with nice heat to the dish. Their red and yellow curries are rich and packed with flavor and the chicken wasn't overcooked at all like some Thai-American places. The beef salad is made very well and one of the best i've had with a perfect amount of rice powder and the beef being really tender. The papaya salad, although i prefer the Lao style is well done here with a slight sweetness and a nice texture from the string beans.My go to dish right now is the BBQ New York Steak which as friend introduced me to a couple years back. What i love most is they know how to cook a good steak, when i ask for medium rare, I get medium rare every time and the size of the steak is pretty large. The house made teriyaki sauce gives the meat a nice tangy flavor without drowning out the taste of the actual meat and the jues sauce is salty and mild in heat that balances out the steak perfectly. End food reviewI've always have got great customer service here parking might not be the best at certain times but, it's my go to place that's close to where I live. They have a great happy hour menu and they're open late (1:30am). If you're out and about drinking this is the perfect spot to end your night and fill up that drunken belly of yours."
644,"Alright but nothing spectacular.  I will say their vegetables especially the sprouts were fresh, but other than that, nothing stood out."
645,"This place just became a dumpster. The new staff are rude, in specific the dude with no hair on the sides go first forgot about my order and then came to my table throwing the bill on the table. Also their restrooms are stinky which I would associate to the quality of their food. It used to be an ok place to get to be just another horrid place in Shattuck avenue. Not even an I am sorry came from them."
646,"I liked their food, but service is not really good. I felt abandoned by servers her two different times."
647,"Sucks , place use to be really good. I get chicken pad see ew every time I've come and the last two times I've came it's been more then underwhelming. Last time it was mushy but I figured it was a bad batch. This time it had no flavor so I sent it back ( bit a carrot to make sure he wasn't going to give me the same plate of food back re tossed) low and behold .... they did ... the same plate of food I sent back they re cooked and added sauce. I worked in food once upon a time and I'm pretty sure that's GROSS for many reasons."
648,"One of my to-go places since it is only half block away from my apartment. I tend to get a simple dinner plate every now and then.I have tried most of their entrees over the years. I am not a big fan of their pad thai or fried rice, since for the price I pay I expect more food. In the meantime, I do like their salads, specifically the lemongrass chicken salad and the beef salad. Both of them have plenty of fresh vegetables with authentic thai spices such as basil, ginger, etc.. I can imagine that to some people these salads are a little exotic, while I enjoy the freshness very much.I rarely dined in but it does have a nice setup, with lots of traditional decorations as well as several TVs. I really hope they can lower down their prices a little bit then I will come here more often."
649,"After three times being here, I feel that the restaurant has a good ambience but the service and the foods, even though are not bad, are not at the top of the class.Their pad thai is very good, and other noddles good. However, they need to improve their service."
650,"The last time I ate here was like 6 years ago before I knew decent Thai food. Today, my boyfriend stumbled upon this restaurant and wanted to dine here since it was kind of inbetween what we both wanted out of a meal. I ordered the pad see ew and the bf ordered some sort of eggplant dish with tom yum soup as an appetizer.The tom yum soup was extremely sour but I don't know if that's how it's supposed to be. It was just too sour for me although the mushrooms were the delicious. I quite enjoyed the eggplant. The pad see ew was decent although definitely not the best. I wouldn't say this place is great Thai food but it hits the spot.The service here is meh. They don't seem to care much for their job or helping a customer out if they can't decide. Would I recommend this place? Meh. But it was a quick spot to eat some Thai food. Can't complain too much."
651,"ahaha walking down Shattuck looking for the medical club and I stumbled upon Tuk Tuk Thai! Reading the name, I thought it was pretty cool and unique that it was called Tuk Tuk Thai as if they were saying ""Duck Duck Goose"" so i walked in and asked for the menu before making my stop! Was I glad i made that little pit stop, other than Imm Thai, Tuk Tuk Thai is another place that still offers really good Thai food in their restaurant. FOOD:I've only had the Pad Thai here though, and It wasn't to greasy or to oily at all like other Pad Thais offered at other Thai Restaurants. They give you so much meat rather its chicken or beef, which is really cool you need that protein! LOCATION: Not in the best location on Shattuck, its away from everything but its a really nice restaurant once you walked inside. You just probably won't notice it unless youre walking, been here before, or youre really on the look out for Tuk Tuk!Other than that, I recommend this Thai restaurant, for those who really enjoy trying new food, and for those who really just love Thai food like I do!"
652,"I waited 15mins for the hot and sour soup. It looks like home food, which means not fancy and even make me a little bit disappointed. It taste good at the first bite, but the noodles on the side is saggy. Overall, fair taste, bad service, dinning environment is not bad."
653,"After giving them a second try, I won't be back to Tuk Tuk Thai. The service is on the slow side and the food is just so so. With so many great options for Thai, I can't recommend them."
654,Been here a few times since it's nearby. It's convenient but prices are a little high for the quality and amount of food you get. Service is okay and it's never crowded unlike Imm Thai. The thai fried rice with breaded chicken is pretty good though. But I'd save my money and go to Imm which is much better taste and quality.
655,"I've been coming here for years, and sometimes it's a hit or miss with their service.The food is generally pretty tasty here, but I've noticed that the wait for your meal to come out is ridiculously long. Last night we waited a good 30 minutes before our food arrived. I wasn't my normal starving self, so I didn't put up a RBF or go up to them to complain (but they did apologize on their own). On the plus side, they're conveniently located, open late and friendly (for the most part). My usual go to's are the tom yum soup, tom kha soup and pad khi mao. Added plus, if you check in you get a Thai ice tea for $1."
656,Location is a little farther from campus than other thai places. This is my go to place along with Imm Thai. Ambiance: I really enjoy coming here since it it's a huge place with open windows. They have a tuk tuk model in the restaurant as well hence the name. Service: Our waiter was very attentive and always made sure our waters were refilled (it's a peeve of mine when they never refill them).

The dishes i've had were all flavorful and cooked perfectly.The Pad Kee Mao is stir fried perfectly and have a nice hint of sweetness and full basil flavor with nice heat to the dish. Their red and yellow curries are rich and packed with flavor and the chicken wasn't overcooked at all like some Thai-American places. The beef salad is made very well and one of the best i've had with a perfect amount of rice powder and the beef being really tender. The papaya salad, although i prefer the Lao style is well done here with a slight sweetness and a nice texture from the string beans.My go to dish right now is the BBQ New York Steak which as friend introduced me to a couple years back. What i love most is they know how to cook a good steak, when i ask for medium rare, I get medium rare every time and the size of the steak is pretty large. The house made teriyaki sauce gives the meat a nice tangy flavor without drowning out the taste of the actual meat and the jues sauce is salty and mild in heat that balances out the steak perfectly. End food reviewI've always have got great customer service here parking might not be the best at certain times but, it's my go to place that's close to where I live. They have a great happy hour menu and they're open late (1:30am). If you're out and about drinking this is the perfect spot to end your night and fill up that drunken belly of yours."
684,"Alright but nothing spectacular.  I will say their vegetables especially the sprouts were fresh, but other than that, nothing stood out."
685,"This place just became a dumpster. The new staff are rude, in specific the dude with no hair on the sides go first forgot about my order and then came to my table throwing the bill on the table. Also their restrooms are stinky which I would associate to the quality of their food. It used to be an ok place to get to be just another horrid place in Shattuck avenue. Not even an I am sorry came from them."
686,"I liked their food, but service is not really good. I felt abandoned by servers her two different times."
687,"Sucks , place use to be really good. I get chicken pad see ew every time I've come and the last two times I've came it's been more then underwhelming. Last time it was mushy but I figured it was a bad batch. This time it had no flavor so I sent it back ( bit a carrot to make sure he wasn't going to give me the same plate of food back re tossed) low and behold .... they did ... the same plate of food I sent back they re cooked and added sauce. I worked in food once upon a time and I'm pretty sure that's GROSS for many reasons."
688,"One of my to-go places since it is only half block away from my apartment. I tend to get a simple dinner plate every now and then.I have tried most of their entrees over the years. I am not a big fan of their pad thai or fried rice, since for the price I pay I expect more food. In the meantime, I do like their salads, specifically the lemongrass chicken salad and the beef salad. Both of them have plenty of fresh vegetables with authentic thai spices such as basil, ginger, etc.. I can imagine that to some people these salads are a little exotic, while I enjoy the freshness very much.I rarely dined in but it does have a nice setup, with lots of traditional decorations as well as several TVs. I really hope they can lower down their prices a little bit then I will come here more often."
689,"After three times being here, I feel that the restaurant has a good ambience but the service and the foods, even though are not bad, are not at the top of the class.Their pad thai is very good, and other noddles good. However, they need to improve their service."
690,"The last time I ate here was like 6 years ago before I knew decent Thai food. Today, my boyfriend stumbled upon this restaurant and wanted to dine here since it was kind of inbetween what we both wanted out of a meal. I ordered the pad see ew and the bf ordered some sort of eggplant dish with tom yum soup as an appetizer.The tom yum soup was extremely sour but I don't know if that's how it's supposed to be. It was just too sour for me although the mushrooms were the delicious. I quite enjoyed the eggplant. The pad see ew was decent although definitely not the best. I wouldn't say this place is great Thai food but it hits the spot.The service here is meh. They don't seem to care much for their job or helping a customer out if they can't decide. Would I recommend this place? Meh. But it was a quick spot to eat some Thai food. Can't complain too much."
691,"ahaha walking down Shattuck looking for the medical club and I stumbled upon Tuk Tuk Thai! Reading the name, I thought it was pretty cool and unique that it was called Tuk Tuk Thai as if they were saying ""Duck Duck Goose"" so i walked in and asked for the menu before making my stop! Was I glad i made that little pit stop, other than Imm Thai, Tuk Tuk Thai is another place that still offers really good Thai food in their restaurant. FOOD:I've only had the Pad Thai here though, and It wasn't to greasy or to oily at all like other Pad Thais offered at other Thai Restaurants. They give you so much meat rather its chicken or beef, which is really cool you need that protein! LOCATION: Not in the best location on Shattuck, its away from everything but its a really nice restaurant once you walked inside. You just probably won't notice it unless youre walking, been here before, or youre really on the look out for Tuk Tuk!Other than that, I recommend this Thai restaurant, for those who really enjoy trying new food, and for those who really just love Thai food like I do!"
692,"I waited 15mins for the hot and sour soup. It looks like home food, which means not fancy and even make me a little bit disappointed. It taste good at the first bite, but the noodles on the side is saggy. Overall, fair taste, bad service, dinning environment is not bad."
693,"After giving them a second try, I won't be back to Tuk Tuk Thai. The service is on the slow side and the food is just so so. With so many great options for Thai, I can't recommend them."
694,Been here a few times since it's nearby. It's convenient but prices are a little high for the quality and amount of food you get. Service is okay and it's never crowded unlike Imm Thai. The thai fried rice with breaded chicken is pretty good though. But I'd save my money and go to Imm which is much better taste and quality.
695,"I've been coming here for years, and sometimes it's a hit or miss with their service.The food is generally pretty tasty here, but I've noticed that the wait for your meal to come out is ridiculously long. Last night we waited a good 30 minutes before our food arrived. I wasn't my normal starving self, so I didn't put up a RBF or go up to them to complain (but they did apologize on their own). On the plus side, they're conveniently located, open late and friendly (for the most part). My usual go to's are the tom yum soup, tom kha soup and pad khi mao. Added plus, if you check in you get a Thai ice tea for $1."
696,Location is a little farther from campus than other thai places. This is my go to place along with Imm Thai. Ambiance: I really enjoy coming here since it it's a huge place with open windows. They have a tuk tuk model in the restaurant as well hence the name. Service: Our waiter was very attentive and always made sure our waters were refilled (it's a peeve of mine when they never refill them). Staff in general is always very friendly whenever I come.Food: I usually go back and forth between the pad thai and pad see ew. They're always consistent and i've been a customer for years. I find both dishes very tasty and filling. Can;t go wrong with the thai tea as well!
697,"Came here for an early dinner. Food was ok. Got the tom kha soup and the chicken was chewy and over cooked.I also checked in on Yelp to get the $1 Thai tea deal. When I realized I could use it and told the server, she came back upset and said, next time, tell your server!""  Wow... so rude and unnecessary. Won't return. There are too many gems in Berkeley - don't come here"
698,"I miss the amazing Thai places I had at my fingertips living in Hillcrest in San Diego, but when a Thai craving just won't go away and you need your fix at 10pm on a Friday night, Tuk Tuk is there for you as the only Thai place around open past 10 (and that you can get delivery through Eat24).I ordered two things via Eat24 delivery: tom kha soup with added shrimp and then the yellow curry with jasmine rice. I very shortly after got a phone call from the restaurant asking what kind of protein I wanted in my curry - the menu on Eat24 only lists chicken as an option so I assumed that was the only option. I explained that and said I'm find with chicken. I was then told it would be about an hour for delivery.Cut to a half hour later, I've been trying to get the Uber app to load the entire time and I'm worrying I won't get to the house I have the food being delivered to in time. I finally got the app to load and I have a ride coming. At this point, I get another call, this time from the delivery driver saying he's at the house. Frustrated, I explain that I was told it would be an hour and it's barely been 30 minutes at this point. The driver is annoyed so I told him to just leave the food on the porch since I paid via Android Pay.Luckily, the food wasn't cold when I got there, I didn't need to heat it up at all but I don't need my food super hot.The soup was all right, not the best tom kha I've had but it was sweet with a little sour and overall a nice, comforting, creamy soup. The stuff in it though, I wasn't too happy with. It was just tons and tons of mushrooms, way more than I usually see in a tom kha. Also, I'd requested it be made with chicken and then paid an extra $3 for shrimp; the soup was made with seafood (it looked like a breaded white fish and then some squid pieces) and both were pretty gross to me. The squid was chewy and the breading on the fish was mushy and tasteless. I threw away all of those pieces. There were two total shrimps in the soup. They were pretty big and nicely cooked, but I was bummed I got no chicken, only two shrimps, and a bunch of seafood I didn't want and was grossed out by.The yellow curry was much better. There was a nice amount of vegetables and not too much of anything, and once I stirred it around I found that they weren't too skimpy on the chicken. The potatoes weren't really cooked enough in my opinion, and were kind of hard and dry. The onions, zucchini, and green beans (interesting addition to a yellow curry) were nicely cooked. I ordered the curry mild spicy and it wasn't really spicy at all which I liked a lot.The portions were good for the price, even though you have to pay $2 for rice ($2.50 if you want brown rice). Service and delivery were quick, if a little too quick for my situation. It curbed my Thai food cravings when no other restaurant in the area could."
699,Best Thai food west of the Mississippi love the pineapple fried rice and the pad Thai love the Thai tea they always give me great service good prices I like the little tuk tuk that sits inside the restaurant
700,"Yum! One of my favorite places to grab Thai food in Berkeley. PROS(+) Awesome Food! The Pad Kee Mao here is delicious - they offer generous portions of noodles - it's not overrun with greens, and if you order protein they really put a lot of it in!(+) Perfect level of spiciness. They have sauces readily available if you would like to add extra spiciness to it. (+) Quick service! Waiters are super attentive and the food comes out in good time. (+) Spacious restaurant - always plenty of room and they spread you out so you aren't seated RIGHT next to another party. (+) Open Late! (+) The candy they give you with your check is really good. CONS(-) More casual/basic kind of place. This isn't like a fancy restaurant, or a place to ""WOW"" your date. Just good food :)"
701,"Super cheap, they don't give rice with their curry and I ordered delivery so there was nothing I could do about it. I was stuck eat curry. Without rice. Just curry.Even worse, I specifically asked the noodles not to be spicy but it's very spicy and I can't eat it. You can see all the chili they added.Sorry, I probably won't be returning unless something was done about the rice issue."
702,"I thought I would try a new delivery place, but I won't try Tuk Tuk Thai again. The noodles were pretty much a compressed brick in the container and half of the spring rolls had burst open. That would probably be fine, but I just didn't enjoy the quality or taste of the food very much."

732,"I waited 15mins for the hot and sour soup. It looks like home food, which means not fancy and even make me a little bit disappointed. It taste good at the first bite, but the noodles on the side is saggy. Overall, fair taste, bad service, dinning environment is not bad."
733,"After giving them a second try, I won't be back to Tuk Tuk Thai. The service is on the slow side and the food is just so so. With so many great options for Thai, I can't recommend them."
734,Been here a few times since it's nearby. It's convenient but prices are a little high for the quality and amount of food you get. Service is okay and it's never crowded unlike Imm Thai. The thai fried rice with breaded chicken is pretty good though. But I'd save my money and go to Imm which is much better taste and quality.
735,"I've been coming here for years, and sometimes it's a hit or miss with their service.The food is generally pretty tasty here, but I've noticed that the wait for your meal to come out is ridiculously long. Last night we waited a good 30 minutes before our food arrived. I wasn't my normal starving self, so I didn't put up a RBF or go up to them to complain (but they did apologize on their own). On the plus side, they're conveniently located, open late and friendly (for the most part). My usual go to's are the tom yum soup, tom kha soup and pad khi mao. Added plus, if you check in you get a Thai ice tea for $1."
736,Location is a little farther from campus than other thai places. This is my go to place along with Imm Thai. Ambiance: I really enjoy coming here since it it's a huge place with open windows. They have a tuk tuk model in the restaurant as well hence the name. Service: Our waiter was very attentive and always made sure our waters were refilled (it's a peeve of mine when they never refill them). Staff in general is always very friendly whenever I come.Food: I usually go back and forth between the pad thai and pad see ew. They're always consistent and i've been a customer for years. I find both dishes very tasty and filling. Can;t go wrong with the thai tea as well!
737,"Came here for an early dinner. Food was ok. Got the tom kha soup and the chicken was chewy and over cooked.I also checked in on Yelp to get the $1 Thai tea deal. When I realized I could use it and told the server, she came back upset and said, next time, tell your server!""  Wow... so rude and unnecessary. Won't return. There are too many gems in Berkeley - don't come here"
738,"I miss the amazing Thai places I had at my fingertips living in Hillcrest in San Diego, but when a Thai craving just won't go away and you need your fix at 10pm on a Friday night, Tuk Tuk is there for you as the only Thai place around open past 10 (and that you can get delivery through Eat24).I ordered two things via Eat24 delivery: tom kha soup with added shrimp and then the yellow curry with jasmine rice. I very shortly after got a phone call from the restaurant asking what kind of protein I wanted in my curry - the menu on Eat24 only lists chicken as an option so I assumed that was the only option. I explained that and said I'm find with chicken. I was then told it would be about an hour for delivery.Cut to a half hour later, I've been trying to get the Uber app to load the entire time and I'm worrying I won't get to the house I have the food being delivered to in time. I finally got the app to load and I have a ride coming. At this point, I get another call, this time from the delivery driver saying he's at the house. Frustrated, I explain that I was told it would be an hour and it's barely been 30 minutes at this point. The driver is annoyed so I told him to just leave the food on the porch since I paid via Android Pay.Luckily, the food wasn't cold when I got there, I didn't need to heat it up at all but I don't need my food super hot.The soup was all right, not the best tom kha I've had but it was sweet with a little sour and overall a nice, comforting, creamy soup. The stuff in it though, I wasn't too happy with. It was just tons and tons of mushrooms, way more than I usually see in a tom kha. Also, I'd requested it be made with chicken and then paid an extra $3 for shrimp; the soup was made with seafood (it looked like a breaded white fish and then some squid pieces) and both were pretty gross to me. The squid was chewy and the breading on the fish was mushy and tasteless. I threw away all of those pieces. There were two total shrimps in the soup. They were pretty big and nicely cooked, but I was bummed I got no chicken, only two shrimps, and a bunch of seafood I didn't want and was grossed out by.The yellow curry was much better. There was a nice amount of vegetables and not too much of anything, and once I stirred it around I found that they weren't too skimpy on the chicken. The potatoes weren't really cooked enough in my opinion, and were kind of hard and dry. The onions, zucchini, and green beans (interesting addition to a yellow curry) were nicely cooked. I ordered the curry mild spicy and it wasn't really spicy at all which I liked a lot.The portions were good for the price, even though you have to pay $2 for rice ($2.50 if you want brown rice). Service and delivery were quick, if a little too quick for my situation. It curbed my Thai food cravings when no other restaurant in the area could."
739,Best Thai food west of the Mississippi love the pineapple fried rice and the pad Thai love the Thai tea they always give me great service good prices I like the little tuk tuk that sits inside the restaurant
740,"Yum! One of my favorite places to grab Thai food in Berkeley. PROS(+) Awesome Food! The Pad Kee Mao here is delicious - they offer generous portions of noodles - it's not overrun with greens, and if you order protein they really put a lot of it in!(+) Perfect level of spiciness. They have sauces readily available if you would like to add extra spiciness to it. (+) Quick service! Waiters are super attentive and the food comes out in good time. (+) Spacious restaurant - always plenty of room and they spread you out so you aren't seated RIGHT next to another party. (+) Open Late! (+) The candy they give you with your check is really good. CONS(-) More casual/basic kind of place. This isn't like a fancy restaurant, or a place to ""WOW"" your date. Just good food :)"
741,"Super cheap, they don't give rice with their curry and I ordered delivery so there was nothing I could do about it. I was stuck eat curry. Without rice. Just curry.Even worse, I specifically asked the noodles not to be spicy but it's very spicy and I can't eat it. You can see all the chili they added.Sorry, I probably won't be returning unless something was done about the rice issue."
742,"I thought I would try a new delivery place, but I won't try Tuk Tuk Thai again. The noodles were pretty much a compressed brick in the container and half of the spring rolls had burst open. That would probably be fine, but I just didn't enjoy the quality or taste of the food very much."
743,"Hmm... I've been coming here for years and I've never written a review for Tuk Tuk Thai Cafe? What?! This was my first experience eating thai food from a restaurant back when I started my food adventure life so, Tuk Tuk Thai will always have a little special place in my heart especially for Pad Kee Mao as this was the cafe I was first introduced to this dish (I've only had Pad Thai at the time).The workers are very friendly and the majority of the workers are Thai. On the outside this cafe seems really small and intimate and once you enter you'll be surprise on how spacious this Thai Cafe is.Food review:Their food is pretty solid and I feel it can blow some of the other Thai-American restaurants out the water. The dishes i've had were all flavorful and cooked perfectly.The Pad Kee Mao is stir fried perfectly and have a nice hint of sweetness and full basil flavor with nice heat to the dish. Their red and yellow curries are rich and packed with flavor and the chicken wasn't overcooked at all like some Thai-American places. The beef salad is made very well and one of the best i've had with a perfect amount of rice powder and the beef being really tender. The papaya salad, although i prefer the Lao style is well done here with a slight sweetness and a nice texture from the string beans.My go to dish right now is the BBQ New York Steak which as friend introduced me to a couple years back. What i love most is they know how to cook a good steak, when i ask for medium rare, I get medium rare every time and the size of the steak is pretty large. The house made teriyaki sauce gives the meat a nice tangy flavor without drowning out the taste of the actual meat and the jues sauce is salty and mild in heat that balances out the steak perfectly. End food reviewI've always have got great customer service here parking might not be the best at certain times but, it's my go to place that's close to where I live. They have a great happy hour menu and they're open late (1:30am). If you're out and about drinking this is the perfect spot to end your night and fill up that drunken belly of yours."
744,"Alright but nothing spectacular.  I will say their vegetables especially the sprouts were fresh, but other than that, nothing stood out."
745,"This place just became a dumpster. The new staff are rude, in specific the dude with no hair on the sides go first forgot about my order and then came to my table throwing the bill on the table. Also their restrooms are stinky which I would associate to the quality of their food. It used to be an ok place to get to be just another horrid place in Shattuck avenue. Not even an I am sorry came from them."
746,"I liked their food, but service is not really good. I felt abandoned by servers her two different times."
747,"Sucks , place use to be really good. I get chicken pad see ew every time I've come and the last two times I've came it's been more then underwhelming. Last time it was mushy but I figured it was a bad batch. This time it had no flavor so I sent it back ( bit a carrot to make sure he wasn't going to give me the same plate of food back re tossed) low and behold .... they did ... the same plate of food I sent back they re cooked and added sauce. I worked in food once upon a time and I'm pretty sure that's GROSS for many reasons."
748,"One of my to-go places since it is only half block away from my apartment. I tend to get a simple dinner plate every now and then.I have tried most of their entrees over the years. I am not a big fan of their pad thai or fried rice, since for the price I pay I expect more food. In the meantime, I do like their salads, specifically the lemongrass chicken salad and the beef salad. Both of them have plenty of fresh vegetables with authentic thai spices such as basil, ginger, etc.. I can imagine that to some people these salads are a little exotic, while I enjoy the freshness very much.I rarely dined in but it does have a nice setup, with lots of traditional decorations as well as several TVs. I really hope they can lower down their prices a little bit then I will come here more often."
749,"After three times being here, I feel that the restaurant has a good ambience but the service and the foods, even though are not bad, are not at the top of the class.Their pad thai is very good, and other noddles good. However, they need to improve their service."
750,"The last time I ate here was like 6 years ago before I knew decent Thai food. Today, my boyfriend stumbled upon this restaurant and wanted to dine here since it was kind of inbetween what we both wanted out of a meal. I ordered the pad see ew and the bf ordered some sort of eggplant dish with tom yum soup as an appetizer.The tom yum soup was extremely sour but I don't know if that's how it's supposed to be. It was just too sour for me although the mushrooms were the delicious. I quite enjoyed the eggplant. The pad see ew was decent although definitely not the best. I wouldn't say this place is great Thai food but it hits the spot.The service here is meh. They don't seem to care much for their job or helping a customer out if they can't decide. Would I recommend this place? Meh. But it was a quick spot to eat some Thai food. Can't complain too much."
751,"ahaha walking down Shattuck looking for the medical club and I stumbled upon Tuk Tuk Thai! Reading the name, I thought it was pretty cool and unique that it was called Tuk Tuk Thai as if they were saying ""Duck Duck Goose"" so i walked in and asked for the menu before making my stop! Was I glad i made that little pit stop, other than Imm Thai, Tuk Tuk Thai is another place that still offers really good Thai food in their restaurant. FOOD:I've only had the Pad Thai here though, and It wasn't to greasy or to oily at all like other Pad Thais offered at other Thai Restaurants. They give you so much meat rather its chicken or beef, which is really cool you need that protein! LOCATION: Not in the best location on Shattuck, its away from everything but its a really nice restaurant once you walked inside. You just probably won't notice it unless youre walking, been here before, or youre really on the look out for Tuk Tuk!Other than that, I recommend this Thai restaurant, for those who really enjoy trying new food, and for those who really just love Thai food like I do!"
