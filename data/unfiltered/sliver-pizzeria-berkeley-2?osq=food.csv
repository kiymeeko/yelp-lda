0,"Sliver, the place started by a few former Cheeseboard employees who said the hell with the collective and started serving alcohol, making it a great place to watch a game and have a drink. Won't be a stretch to say that they took a few things with them - mainly the concept of one type of vegetarian pizza daily and that amazing green sauce!The pizza is amazing. Yes, some days are better than others but this is subjective and depends on your pizza preferences. But what's better than an amazing pizza? Amazing pizza you can share with friends while drinking a cold one and watching the game. This is where the two concepts diverge. One is not better than the other, it just depends on what you prefer in the specific case. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Is it a bit overhyped? Sure, but it mostly delivers."
1,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE. It's so hard to chew that my jaw literally hurts so much I don't even want to eat anymore. It's like chewing on cardboard.I definitely DO NOT want to come back here and would rather eat some Dominos, Pizza Hut, pls anything else but this."
2,"I got Sliver delivered by Caviar. The whole pie was 24$ plus taxes $2 something and $4 something for service fee plus 2$ tip. So even though Delivery was free the total charge for whole pizza came out to 33$ for me. Not cheap at all. Probably won't get it delivered again. Today's pizza had potatoes, caramelized onions (according to the menu but I couldn't taste it at all), goat cheese, mozzarella and olive oil. The whole pie came with 2 slivers (1 extra slice) which was a nice touch. The pizza was good and cilantro sauce was yum. It's basically chutney (Indian sauce lol). Overall,Not the best pizza I've had by far but it was good. Definitely wasn't worth what I spent on it."
3,"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Since they've only got one kind of pizza a day the only decision you have to make is how much to order! Another positive to this method is that it's ready immediately - they've just got hot pizzas waiting to be plated.  Between my boyfriend and I, we split a half and I ended up taking home a slice.  Totally reasonable prices - the half was not much more than $12, and they were very generous.There were a lot of flies inside, but what can you expect for a sports bar?  This is a casual spot and clearly popular with all the cal students.  We ate in but will probably do take out next time because parking kind of sucks in the area.They've got an amazing cilantro sauce that goes on the pizza that I would recommend to anyone (even cilantro haters, like myself)!  Love that you don't have to ask for water cups, and there's foil and paper bags to wrap your leftovers in.  Will definitely be back!"
4,"TL;DR 1 AWESOME vegetarian pizza/dayWhat is Sliver:They serve 1 vegetarian pizza each day. Meat lovers: don't be afraid, it will be great, and it will satisfy you.PLUSES:+ location: DT Berkeley, next to BART station & Cal+ vegetarian!! + crust + toppings are awesome, their 1 flavor a day pizza has never disappointed+ check online to see what the toppings of the day are+ their long line can be intimidating, but goes by pretty fastDELTAS:- Not as good as Cheese....."
5,"Oh my god, the green sauce!!! That was the biggest game changer for this place. I first went here when I was visiting my boyfriend in Berkeley. I could eat pizza everyday and this was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas that I have tried. I'm so heartbroken that I don't live anywhere near here because this would for sure be my go to place. The way this place works is that they have one flavor that they serve a day and that's it. And while that may not seem appealing at first it's like a mini adventure to try something that you might not have ever thought of ordering before. Every time I walked by this place it seemed like it was completely packed and every table was taken so that already is a pretty good sign that you're in for something good.About half of a full pizza was about $12 and even sharing that with two people was more than enough especially with the extra slivers that you get on top.I went here on a Thursday so when I went the pizza of the day was the roasted Yukon gold potato pizza. When I first heard that they were gonna be putting potatoes on my pizza I was a little hesitant but after taking one bite I was completely sold. You 100% have to get the green sauce to go with your pizza. It  enhances the flavor so well and makes it 10x better. If you don't use it you're doing it wrong. Can't wait to try the other pizzas of the day when I go back to visit."
6,"I absolutely love this pizza place. I might be a bit sentimental, but I've spent a lot of time with some of my best friends at Slivers. They give you a sliver of pizza every time you order a slice, or two slivers if you order a whole pizza. The first time I had it, I didn't even realize I was eating a vegetarian pizza! Everyday they have a different pizza, and they only serve one type of pizza a day. Super unique, and very efficient. If you like a bit of kick to your pizza, try their green sauce next to the water. It goes so well with any of their pizzas. If you want to find me in Berkeley, Slivers is where I'll be."
7,"3.5 round up / We came here bc the line for Cheeseboard intimidated us. Today's special had corn!!!!! Corn on  pizza is the best. The cilantro green sauce was also good. The line was really short but the service for the bar was quite slow. They check IDs for each beer *_* I'm old af. Below average beer selection. Good place for college or high school dates, lol.I don't actually understand the hype of this place and would only recommend if you are craving pizza in the area."
8,"I came here during memorial day on a recommendation that this is one of the best pizza places in Berkeley. It seems like any other pizza joint styles places with a good beer selection, tv, and pizza. At this point you don't have a menu, you have one pizza. We ordered the half pizza and got 2 slices for free. It seem pretty awesome to get some extra pizza. I enjoyed the ambiance of the pizza place ; Sports bar. Parking is tricky here in the sense that its street parking if you're lucky or the paid parking lot across the street. I came here for lunch when it just opened so it wasn't crowded but given that this is a college town I can see how crowded this gets. I loved the pizza. However I do like my freedom of choice and not being told what to eat. Though this is like a omakase style pizza joint, I'd prefer creating my own pizza place. But if I'm back in Berkeley I would hit up Sliver again or Cheeseboard.GO BEARS!"
9,"I came here on a weekday in the late afternoon to grab a single slice before getting on the Bart. Sliver only offers one flavor of pizza each day and the flavor changes every single day. When I went, the flavor was ""crimini mushrooms, yellow onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, fresh herbs, infused rosemary & chanterelle mushroom olive oil"".The slice comes with a small ""sliver"" on top, which is a nice bonus. The pizza was really oily, so I had to grab some napkins to blot off the oil. The pizza was quite aromatic because of the mushroom olive oil that they used, along with the actual mushrooms on top. The pizza was tasty and flavorful, but I personally didn't find it to be extraordinary and worth the $3.25 (including tax)."
10,"I heard a lot of great things about this place! I went on a Saturday before the lunch rush. I order the special pizza for the day. It had pineapple, arugula, mozzarella and something else. I was surprised when the pizza was tough and hard to bite into. I didn't think it tasted that good. The good thing was the pesto sauce they have on the side. I had to dip my pizza in that so it had some flavor! It could be just this day and the special they had. I see on the menu some of the other specials and it looks bomb. I would come back and try another pizza."
11,"One type of pizza everyday, $3.25 per slice plus you get a little extra sliver. Water dispenser. Delicious pesto sauce condiment. Great outdoor seating as well.Came here to grab a quick bite before a graduation ceremony and was glad to have a full belly."
12,"Sliver is a vegetarian pizza place that serves one type of tasty pizza a day. My favorite flavor so far is definitely the potato and corn, but the other types are also unique and delicious. Occasionally, there are also new unique combinations that feature ingredients like peaches or blue cheese (super interesting to try, you could always buy a slice to try and eat somewhere else closeby if you don't like it). I usually check online to see what flavors they're serving each day that week, since I definitely prefer some pizzas over others. Along with that, there's a green sauce that's a great addition to the the cheesy non-marinara pizzas. They also serve frescas now, which are refreshing and not overly sweet.It's probably important to note that this place is very similar to Cheeseboard, in pizza and concept. Though it's still a quick and affordable place (especially closer to campus) for some delicious pizza."
13,"Pizza here reminds me of their East Bay neighbors The Cheese Board, Arizmendi Bakery, and Nabolom Bakery. All of them are serving one type of vegetarian pizza daily and aiming to create a community around good food including pizza. Prices are more or less similar too.Like The Cheese Board and Nabolom, their green sauce is a must try. Spicy sauce fans forget red chili pepper flakes and grab a few containers of their sauce.What sets Sliver Pizzeria from the rest is the setting. It's a sports bar with a full bar inside, TVs with sports on, long community tables, happy hour specials, and live music Friday's and Saturday's. If you're not in the mood, you can always get it to go or sit outside.I personally prefer Nabolom and Arizmendi's crust, but the pizza here is still solid. Plus, you gotta love those extra baby slices with your pizza."
14,"Food 4/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Bang for your buck 4/5. A great place to catch the games and get some pizzas with high quality ingredients. Note this place only has vegetarian pizza and one flavor per day. Check on their website to see which flavor is showcased today! On any given day, Sliver can get pretty busy, and even busier on days when there is a game playing. However, the line usually moves pretty rapidly because pizzas are continuously being baked. But, you might have a hard time find seating. If it does happen don't worry, it it's a nice day out bring your pizza on the front lawn of UC Berkeley. The one thing that makes it special is they actually provide two slivers with your slice of whole pizza, and hence the name. A really good deal is actually getting a slice of pizza and a salad. All the flavors are really good with top notch ingredients but I usually avoid days where they have tomatoes as a topping, as it doesn't add much to the pizza. I usually go for days where the toppings either include potatoes, or mushrooms or corn (best days). My own trope is that their pizza can get pretty oily because of the cheese. However, the green sauce that you can scoop yourself is pretty amazing and helps tame the oils from the pizza. Overall, it's a solid place to get pizza. I only wished sometimes that they did a meat pizza but I guess you can't have it all. Tips - Its cheaper to get a full pizza for $20 and share it between friends! Pros - High quality ingredients and with only one flavor you don't have to decide which flavor you want! Cons - the pizza can get oily but the green sauce help mitigate that."
15,"Pizza is OK but kinda inconsistent.  We stayed at the restaurant for a couple of hours to watch a warrior game.  The first pizza was good while the second one too oily, had way too much cheese,  and was a little undercooked.   I do like the green sauce but do not like the fact that there is only one type of pizza per day.Happy hour is 3PM - 6PM, you get pizza slivers with your order of alcohol."
16,"Their pizza is very much worth the hype! Always vegetarian and made fresh daily, their changing daily menu makes it easy to go every day. Their website is updated with the menu schedule for the week, so make sure to check it before you go! Their crust itself is more of a flatbread style rather than a fluffy crust style, and is slightly greasier than I'd like, but not more than is expected of a typical pizza. Either way, their pairing of toppings is impeccable, and each one is a delight. My personal favorite is the corn pizza, which I like to drizzle some of their pesto and squeeze a hint of lime on. The only thing is the lines can get pretty crazy during peak times, but service is quick."
17,"My boyfriend took me here as a ""must-go"" staple in Berkeley and I didn't know what to expect! The pizza was SO good - albeit a bit oily, but it's pizza (what do you expect). I had no idea what I was eating (what toppings) because we went in, got 2 slices of pizza, was handed the pizza and then walked out to proceed with our Berkeley food tour. Apparently the pizza of the day was something with kalamata olives (which I thought were some sort of meat) but ALL THEIR PIZZAS ARE VEGETARIAN ! I hope this place continues to change people's perceptions of vegetarian pizzas being less flavorful, delicious or desirable because this pizza was definitely better than many of the meat-included pizzas I've had in my LIFETIME. Definitely worth the visit, prices are reasonable because you're in a college town, good quality, would 10/10 recommend."
18,"The green sauce!!! Sliver's green sauce is the main reason I want to eat here all the time.(For reference, I have never tried Cheese Board)Sliver changes their pizza toppings daily, so check their website before going in if you're a picky eater! My favorite pizzas are the ones topped with corn and mushrooms. Their pizzas are more like cheesy bread (think of a flatter version of the cheese bread at Sweet Tomatoes). They have a thin crust with a generous amount of cheese + a sparse sprinkle of toppings. Their sauce is the reason I keep coming back--it's tangy with a bit of heat. It's the perfect compliment to their cheesy pizza and would taste good on practically anything.For the price (a bit over $20 for a whole pizza or a few bucks for slice), I do wish that they'd be more generous with the toppings. Also, from a value perspective, not the most cost-efficient which is why I'm giving it 4-stars."
19,"I've been to Sliver Pizzeria over 5 times and I've never had a bad pizza.  Some pizzas are tastier than others though.  Check out Sliver's website to see the pizza of the day!  Sliver only sells one type of pizza each day and the pizza is always vegetarian!  Be sure to warn any meat lovers you may be taking to Sliver with you.  I didn't warn my Filipino meat-loving mom when I took her to Sliver and she was shocked that there weren't any meat pizzas available.  She said she was going to go to Top Dog nearby to get a hot dog to fill her need for meat. -__-  Anyway, when you eat the pizza at Sliver, be sure to put some of the free green sauce on it.  The pizza is not complete without the green sauce.  Also, if you plan to drink alcohol at Sliver, I do not recommend the sangria.  It just tasted like juice and there were no visible fruits in the drink...  It could've been better."

So even though Delivery was free the total charge for whole pizza came out to 33$ for me. Not cheap at all. Probably won't get it delivered again. Today's pizza had potatoes, caramelized onions (according to the menu but I couldn't taste it at all), goat cheese, mozzarella and olive oil. The whole pie came with 2 slivers (1 extra slice) which was a nice touch. The pizza was good and cilantro sauce was yum. It's basically chutney (Indian sauce lol). Overall,Not the best pizza I've had by far but it was good. Definitely wasn't worth what I spent on it."
43,"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Since they've only got one kind of pizza a day the only decision you have to make is how much to order! Another positive to this method is that it's ready immediately - they've just got hot pizzas waiting to be plated.  Between my boyfriend and I, we split a half and I ended up taking home a slice.  Totally reasonable prices - the half was not much more than $12, and they were very generous.There were a lot of flies inside, but what can you expect for a sports bar?  This is a casual spot and clearly popular with all the cal students.  We ate in but will probably do take out next time because parking kind of sucks in the area.They've got an amazing cilantro sauce that goes on the pizza that I would recommend to anyone (even cilantro haters, like myself)!  Love that you don't have to ask for water cups, and there's foil and paper bags to wrap your leftovers in.  Will definitely be back!"
44,"TL;DR 1 AWESOME vegetarian pizza/dayWhat is Sliver:They serve 1 vegetarian pizza each day. Meat lovers: don't be afraid, it will be great, and it will satisfy you.PLUSES:+ location: DT Berkeley, next to BART station & Cal+ vegetarian!! + crust + toppings are awesome, their 1 flavor a day pizza has never disappointed+ check online to see what the toppings of the day are+ their long line can be intimidating, but goes by pretty fastDELTAS:- Not as good as Cheese....."
45,"Oh my god, the green sauce!!! That was the biggest game changer for this place. I first went here when I was visiting my boyfriend in Berkeley. I could eat pizza everyday and this was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas that I have tried. I'm so heartbroken that I don't live anywhere near here because this would for sure be my go to place. The way this place works is that they have one flavor that they serve a day and that's it. And while that may not seem appealing at first it's like a mini adventure to try something that you might not have ever thought of ordering before. Every time I walked by this place it seemed like it was completely packed and every table was taken so that already is a pretty good sign that you're in for something good.About half of a full pizza was about $12 and even sharing that with two people was more than enough especially with the extra slivers that you get on top.I went here on a Thursday so when I went the pizza of the day was the roasted Yukon gold potato pizza. When I first heard that they were gonna be putting potatoes on my pizza I was a little hesitant but after taking one bite I was completely sold. You 100% have to get the green sauce to go with your pizza. It  enhances the flavor so well and makes it 10x better. If you don't use it you're doing it wrong. Can't wait to try the other pizzas of the day when I go back to visit."
46,"I absolutely love this pizza place. I might be a bit sentimental, but I've spent a lot of time with some of my best friends at Slivers. They give you a sliver of pizza every time you order a slice, or two slivers if you order a whole pizza. The first time I had it, I didn't even realize I was eating a vegetarian pizza! Everyday they have a different pizza, and they only serve one type of pizza a day. Super unique, and very efficient. If you like a bit of kick to your pizza, try their green sauce next to the water. It goes so well with any of their pizzas. If you want to find me in Berkeley, Slivers is where I'll be."
47,"3.5 round up / We came here bc the line for Cheeseboard intimidated us. Today's special had corn!!!!! Corn on  pizza is the best. The cilantro green sauce was also good. The line was really short but the service for the bar was quite slow. They check IDs for each beer *_* I'm old af. Below average beer selection. Good place for college or high school dates, lol.I don't actually understand the hype of this place and would only recommend if you are craving pizza in the area."
48,"I came here during memorial day on a recommendation that this is one of the best pizza places in Berkeley. It seems like any other pizza joint styles places with a good beer selection, tv, and pizza. At this point you don't have a menu, you have one pizza. We ordered the half pizza and got 2 slices for free. It seem pretty awesome to get some extra pizza. I enjoyed the ambiance of the pizza place ; Sports bar. Parking is tricky here in the sense that its street parking if you're lucky or the paid parking lot across the street. I came here for lunch when it just opened so it wasn't crowded but given that this is a college town I can see how crowded this gets. I loved the pizza. However I do like my freedom of choice and not being told what to eat. Though this is like a omakase style pizza joint, I'd prefer creating my own pizza place. But if I'm back in Berkeley I would hit up Sliver again or Cheeseboard.GO BEARS!"
49,"I came here on a weekday in the late afternoon to grab a single slice before getting on the Bart. Sliver only offers one flavor of pizza each day and the flavor changes every single day. When I went, the flavor was ""crimini mushrooms, yellow onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, fresh herbs, infused rosemary & chanterelle mushroom olive oil"".The slice comes with a small ""sliver"" on top, which is a nice bonus. The pizza was really oily, so I had to grab some napkins to blot off the oil. The pizza was quite aromatic because of the mushroom olive oil that they used, along with the actual mushrooms on top. The pizza was tasty and flavorful, but I personally didn't find it to be extraordinary and worth the $3.25 (including tax)."
50,"I heard a lot of great things about this place! I went on a Saturday before the lunch rush. I order the special pizza for the day. It had pineapple, arugula, mozzarella and something else. I was surprised when the pizza was tough and hard to bite into. I didn't think it tasted that good. The good thing was the pesto sauce they have on the side. I had to dip my pizza in that so it had some flavor! It could be just this day and the special they had. I see on the menu some of the other specials and it looks bomb. I would come back and try another pizza."
51,"One type of pizza everyday, $3.25 per slice plus you get a little extra sliver. Water dispenser. Delicious pesto sauce condiment. Great outdoor seating as well.Came here to grab a quick bite before a graduation ceremony and was glad to have a full belly."
52,"Sliver is a vegetarian pizza place that serves one type of tasty pizza a day. My favorite flavor so far is definitely the potato and corn, but the other types are also unique and delicious. Occasionally, there are also new unique combinations that feature ingredients like peaches or blue cheese (super interesting to try, you could always buy a slice to try and eat somewhere else closeby if you don't like it). I usually check online to see what flavors they're serving each day that week, since I definitely prefer some pizzas over others. Along with that, there's a green sauce that's a great addition to the the cheesy non-marinara pizzas. They also serve frescas now, which are refreshing and not overly sweet.It's probably important to note that this place is very similar to Cheeseboard, in pizza and concept. Though it's still a quick and affordable place (especially closer to campus) for some delicious pizza."
53,"Pizza here reminds me of their East Bay neighbors The Cheese Board, Arizmendi Bakery, and Nabolom Bakery. All of them are serving one type of vegetarian pizza daily and aiming to create a community around good food including pizza. Prices are more or less similar too.Like The Cheese Board and Nabolom, their green sauce is a must try. Spicy sauce fans forget red chili pepper flakes and grab a few containers of their sauce.What sets Sliver Pizzeria from the rest is the setting. It's a sports bar with a full bar inside, TVs with sports on, long community tables, happy hour specials, and live music Friday's and Saturday's. If you're not in the mood, you can always get it to go or sit outside.I personally prefer Nabolom and Arizmendi's crust, but the pizza here is still solid. Plus, you gotta love those extra baby slices with your pizza."
54,"Food 4/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Bang for your buck 4/5. A great place to catch the games and get some pizzas with high quality ingredients. Note this place only has vegetarian pizza and one flavor per day. Check on their website to see which flavor is showcased today! On any given day, Sliver can get pretty busy, and even busier on days when there is a game playing. However, the line usually moves pretty rapidly because pizzas are continuously being baked. But, you might have a hard time find seating. If it does happen don't worry, it it's a nice day out bring your pizza on the front lawn of UC Berkeley. The one thing that makes it special is they actually provide two slivers with your slice of whole pizza, and hence the name. A really good deal is actually getting a slice of pizza and a salad. All the flavors are really good with top notch ingredients but I usually avoid days where they have tomatoes as a topping, as it doesn't add much to the pizza. I usually go for days where the toppings either include potatoes, or mushrooms or corn (best days). My own trope is that their pizza can get pretty oily because of the cheese. However, the green sauce that you can scoop yourself is pretty amazing and helps tame the oils from the pizza. Overall, it's a solid place to get pizza. I only wished sometimes that they did a meat pizza but I guess you can't have it all. Tips - Its cheaper to get a full pizza for $20 and share it between friends! Pros - High quality ingredients and with only one flavor you don't have to decide which flavor you want! Cons - the pizza can get oily but the green sauce help mitigate that."
55,"Pizza is OK but kinda inconsistent.  We stayed at the restaurant for a couple of hours to watch a warrior game.  The first pizza was good while the second one too oily, had way too much cheese,  and was a little undercooked.   I do like the green sauce but do not like the fact that there is only one type of pizza per day.Happy hour is 3PM - 6PM, you get pizza slivers with your order of alcohol."
56,"Their pizza is very much worth the hype! Always vegetarian and made fresh daily, their changing daily menu makes it easy to go every day. Their website is updated with the menu schedule for the week, so make sure to check it before you go! Their crust itself is more of a flatbread style rather than a fluffy crust style, and is slightly greasier than I'd like, but not more than is expected of a typical pizza. Either way, their pairing of toppings is impeccable, and each one is a delight. My personal favorite is the corn pizza, which I like to drizzle some of their pesto and squeeze a hint of lime on. The only thing is the lines can get pretty crazy during peak times, but service is quick."
57,"My boyfriend took me here as a ""must-go"" staple in Berkeley and I didn't know what to expect! The pizza was SO good - albeit a bit oily, but it's pizza (what do you expect). I had no idea what I was eating (what toppings) because we went in, got 2 slices of pizza, was handed the pizza and then walked out to proceed with our Berkeley food tour. Apparently the pizza of the day was something with kalamata olives (which I thought were some sort of meat) but ALL THEIR PIZZAS ARE VEGETARIAN ! I hope this place continues to change people's perceptions of vegetarian pizzas being less flavorful, delicious or desirable because this pizza was definitely better than many of the meat-included pizzas I've had in my LIFETIME. Definitely worth the visit, prices are reasonable because you're in a college town, good quality, would 10/10 recommend."
58,"The green sauce!!! Sliver's green sauce is the main reason I want to eat here all the time.(For reference, I have never tried Cheese Board)Sliver changes their pizza toppings daily, so check their website before going in if you're a picky eater! My favorite pizzas are the ones topped with corn and mushrooms. Their pizzas are more like cheesy bread (think of a flatter version of the cheese bread at Sweet Tomatoes). They have a thin crust with a generous amount of cheese + a sparse sprinkle of toppings. Their sauce is the reason I keep coming back--it's tangy with a bit of heat. It's the perfect compliment to their cheesy pizza and would taste good on practically anything.For the price (a bit over $20 for a whole pizza or a few bucks for slice), I do wish that they'd be more generous with the toppings. Also, from a value perspective, not the most cost-efficient which is why I'm giving it 4-stars."
59,"I've been to Sliver Pizzeria over 5 times and I've never had a bad pizza.  Some pizzas are tastier than others though.  Check out Sliver's website to see the pizza of the day!  Sliver only sells one type of pizza each day and the pizza is always vegetarian!  Be sure to warn any meat lovers you may be taking to Sliver with you.  I didn't warn my Filipino meat-loving mom when I took her to Sliver and she was shocked that there weren't any meat pizzas available.  She said she was going to go to Top Dog nearby to get a hot dog to fill her need for meat. -__-  Anyway, when you eat the pizza at Sliver, be sure to put some of the free green sauce on it.  The pizza is not complete without the green sauce.  Also, if you plan to drink alcohol at Sliver, I do not recommend the sangria.  It just tasted like juice and there were no visible fruits in the drink...  It could've been better."
60,"Sliver, the place started by a few former Cheeseboard employees who said the hell with the collective and started serving alcohol, making it a great place to watch a game and have a drink. Won't be a stretch to say that they took a few things with them - mainly the concept of one type of vegetarian pizza daily and that amazing green sauce!The pizza is amazing. Yes, some days are better than others but this is subjective and depends on your pizza preferences. But what's better than an amazing pizza? Amazing pizza you can share with friends while drinking a cold one and watching the game. This is where the two concepts diverge. One is not better than the other, it just depends on what you prefer in the specific case. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Is it a bit overhyped? Sure, but it mostly delivers."
61,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE.

Another positive to this method is that it's ready immediately - they've just got hot pizzas waiting to be plated.  Between my boyfriend and I, we split a half and I ended up taking home a slice.  Totally reasonable prices - the half was not much more than $12, and they were very generous.There were a lot of flies inside, but what can you expect for a sports bar?  This is a casual spot and clearly popular with all the cal students.  We ate in but will probably do take out next time because parking kind of sucks in the area.They've got an amazing cilantro sauce that goes on the pizza that I would recommend to anyone (even cilantro haters, like myself)!  Love that you don't have to ask for water cups, and there's foil and paper bags to wrap your leftovers in.  Will definitely be back!"
84,"TL;DR 1 AWESOME vegetarian pizza/dayWhat is Sliver:They serve 1 vegetarian pizza each day.

85,"Oh my god, the green sauce!!! That was the biggest game changer for this place. I first went here when I was visiting my boyfriend in Berkeley. I could eat pizza everyday and this was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas that I have tried. I'm so heartbroken that I don't live anywhere near here because this would for sure be my go to place. The way this place works is that they have one flavor that they serve a day and that's it. And while that may not seem appealing at first it's like a mini adventure to try something that you might not have ever thought of ordering before. Every time I walked by this place it seemed like it was completely packed and every table was taken so that already is a pretty good sign that you're in for something good.About half of a full pizza was about $12 and even sharing that with two people was more than enough especially with the extra slivers that you get on top.I went here on a Thursday so when I went the pizza of the day was the roasted Yukon gold potato pizza. When I first heard that they were gonna be putting potatoes on my pizza I was a little hesitant but after taking one bite I was completely sold. You 100% have to get the green sauce to go with your pizza. It  enhances the flavor so well and makes it 10x better. If you don't use it you're doing it wrong. Can't wait to try the other pizzas of the day when I go back to visit."
86,"I absolutely love this pizza place. I might be a bit sentimental, but I've spent a lot of time with some of my best friends at Slivers. They give you a sliver of pizza every time you order a slice, or two slivers if you order a whole pizza. The first time I had it, I didn't even realize I was eating a vegetarian pizza! Everyday they have a different pizza, and they only serve one type of pizza a day. Super unique, and very efficient. If you like a bit of kick to your pizza, try their green sauce next to the water. It goes so well with any of their pizzas. If you want to find me in Berkeley, Slivers is where I'll be."
87,"3.5 round up / We came here bc the line for Cheeseboard intimidated us. Today's special had corn!!!!! Corn on  pizza is the best. The cilantro green sauce was also good. The line was really short but the service for the bar was quite slow. They check IDs for each beer *_* I'm old af. Below average beer selection. Good place for college or high school dates, lol.I don't actually understand the hype of this place and would only recommend if you are craving pizza in the area."
88,"I came here during memorial day on a recommendation that this is one of the best pizza places in Berkeley. It seems like any other pizza joint styles places with a good beer selection, tv, and pizza. At this point you don't have a menu, you have one pizza. We ordered the half pizza and got 2 slices for free. It seem pretty awesome to get some extra pizza. I enjoyed the ambiance of the pizza place ; Sports bar. Parking is tricky here in the sense that its street parking if you're lucky or the paid parking lot across the street. I came here for lunch when it just opened so it wasn't crowded but given that this is a college town I can see how crowded this gets. I loved the pizza. However I do like my freedom of choice and not being told what to eat. Though this is like a omakase style pizza joint, I'd prefer creating my own pizza place. But if I'm back in Berkeley I would hit up Sliver again or Cheeseboard.GO BEARS!"
89,"I came here on a weekday in the late afternoon to grab a single slice before getting on the Bart. Sliver only offers one flavor of pizza each day and the flavor changes every single day. When I went, the flavor was ""crimini mushrooms, yellow onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, fresh herbs, infused rosemary & chanterelle mushroom olive oil"".The slice comes with a small ""sliver"" on top, which is a nice bonus. The pizza was really oily, so I had to grab some napkins to blot off the oil. The pizza was quite aromatic because of the mushroom olive oil that they used, along with the actual mushrooms on top. The pizza was tasty and flavorful, but I personally didn't find it to be extraordinary and worth the $3.25 (including tax)."
90,"I heard a lot of great things about this place! I went on a Saturday before the lunch rush. I order the special pizza for the day. It had pineapple, arugula, mozzarella and something else. I was surprised when the pizza was tough and hard to bite into. I didn't think it tasted that good. The good thing was the pesto sauce they have on the side. I had to dip my pizza in that so it had some flavor! It could be just this day and the special they had. I see on the menu some of the other specials and it looks bomb. I would come back and try another pizza."
91,"One type of pizza everyday, $3.25 per slice plus you get a little extra sliver. Water dispenser. Delicious pesto sauce condiment. Great outdoor seating as well.Came here to grab a quick bite before a graduation ceremony and was glad to have a full belly."
92,"Sliver is a vegetarian pizza place that serves one type of tasty pizza a day. My favorite flavor so far is definitely the potato and corn, but the other types are also unique and delicious. Occasionally, there are also new unique combinations that feature ingredients like peaches or blue cheese (super interesting to try, you could always buy a slice to try and eat somewhere else closeby if you don't like it). I usually check online to see what flavors they're serving each day that week, since I definitely prefer some pizzas over others. Along with that, there's a green sauce that's a great addition to the the cheesy non-marinara pizzas. They also serve frescas now, which are refreshing and not overly sweet.It's probably important to note that this place is very similar to Cheeseboard, in pizza and concept. Though it's still a quick and affordable place (especially closer to campus) for some delicious pizza."
93,"Pizza here reminds me of their East Bay neighbors The Cheese Board, Arizmendi Bakery, and Nabolom Bakery. All of them are serving one type of vegetarian pizza daily and aiming to create a community around good food including pizza. Prices are more or less similar too.Like The Cheese Board and Nabolom, their green sauce is a must try. Spicy sauce fans forget red chili pepper flakes and grab a few containers of their sauce.What sets Sliver Pizzeria from the rest is the setting. It's a sports bar with a full bar inside, TVs with sports on, long community tables, happy hour specials, and live music Friday's and Saturday's. If you're not in the mood, you can always get it to go or sit outside.I personally prefer Nabolom and Arizmendi's crust, but the pizza here is still solid. Plus, you gotta love those extra baby slices with your pizza."
94,"Food 4/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Bang for your buck 4/5. A great place to catch the games and get some pizzas with high quality ingredients. Note this place only has vegetarian pizza and one flavor per day. Check on their website to see which flavor is showcased today! On any given day, Sliver can get pretty busy, and even busier on days when there is a game playing. However, the line usually moves pretty rapidly because pizzas are continuously being baked. But, you might have a hard time find seating. If it does happen don't worry, it it's a nice day out bring your pizza on the front lawn of UC Berkeley. The one thing that makes it special is they actually provide two slivers with your slice of whole pizza, and hence the name. A really good deal is actually getting a slice of pizza and a salad. All the flavors are really good with top notch ingredients but I usually avoid days where they have tomatoes as a topping, as it doesn't add much to the pizza. I usually go for days where the toppings either include potatoes, or mushrooms or corn (best days). My own trope is that their pizza can get pretty oily because of the cheese. However, the green sauce that you can scoop yourself is pretty amazing and helps tame the oils from the pizza. Overall, it's a solid place to get pizza. I only wished sometimes that they did a meat pizza but I guess you can't have it all. Tips - Its cheaper to get a full pizza for $20 and share it between friends! Pros - High quality ingredients and with only one flavor you don't have to decide which flavor you want! Cons - the pizza can get oily but the green sauce help mitigate that."
95,"Pizza is OK but kinda inconsistent.  We stayed at the restaurant for a couple of hours to watch a warrior game.  The first pizza was good while the second one too oily, had way too much cheese,  and was a little undercooked.   I do like the green sauce but do not like the fact that there is only one type of pizza per day.Happy hour is 3PM - 6PM, you get pizza slivers with your order of alcohol."
96,"Their pizza is very much worth the hype! Always vegetarian and made fresh daily, their changing daily menu makes it easy to go every day. Their website is updated with the menu schedule for the week, so make sure to check it before you go! Their crust itself is more of a flatbread style rather than a fluffy crust style, and is slightly greasier than I'd like, but not more than is expected of a typical pizza. Either way, their pairing of toppings is impeccable, and each one is a delight. My personal favorite is the corn pizza, which I like to drizzle some of their pesto and squeeze a hint of lime on. The only thing is the lines can get pretty crazy during peak times, but service is quick."
97,"My boyfriend took me here as a ""must-go"" staple in Berkeley and I didn't know what to expect! The pizza was SO good - albeit a bit oily, but it's pizza (what do you expect). I had no idea what I was eating (what toppings) because we went in, got 2 slices of pizza, was handed the pizza and then walked out to proceed with our Berkeley food tour. Apparently the pizza of the day was something with kalamata olives (which I thought were some sort of meat) but ALL THEIR PIZZAS ARE VEGETARIAN ! I hope this place continues to change people's perceptions of vegetarian pizzas being less flavorful, delicious or desirable because this pizza was definitely better than many of the meat-included pizzas I've had in my LIFETIME. Definitely worth the visit, prices are reasonable because you're in a college town, good quality, would 10/10 recommend."
98,"The green sauce!!! Sliver's green sauce is the main reason I want to eat here all the time.(For reference, I have never tried Cheese Board)Sliver changes their pizza toppings daily, so check their website before going in if you're a picky eater! My favorite pizzas are the ones topped with corn and mushrooms. Their pizzas are more like cheesy bread (think of a flatter version of the cheese bread at Sweet Tomatoes). They have a thin crust with a generous amount of cheese + a sparse sprinkle of toppings. Their sauce is the reason I keep coming back--it's tangy with a bit of heat. It's the perfect compliment to their cheesy pizza and would taste good on practically anything.For the price (a bit over $20 for a whole pizza or a few bucks for slice), I do wish that they'd be more generous with the toppings. Also, from a value perspective, not the most cost-efficient which is why I'm giving it 4-stars."
99,"I've been to Sliver Pizzeria over 5 times and I've never had a bad pizza.  Some pizzas are tastier than others though.  Check out Sliver's website to see the pizza of the day!  Sliver only sells one type of pizza each day and the pizza is always vegetarian!  Be sure to warn any meat lovers you may be taking to Sliver with you.  I didn't warn my Filipino meat-loving mom when I took her to Sliver and she was shocked that there weren't any meat pizzas available.  She said she was going to go to Top Dog nearby to get a hot dog to fill her need for meat. -__-  Anyway, when you eat the pizza at Sliver, be sure to put some of the free green sauce on it.  The pizza is not complete without the green sauce.  Also, if you plan to drink alcohol at Sliver, I do not recommend the sangria.  It just tasted like juice and there were no visible fruits in the drink...  It could've been better."
100,"Sliver, the place started by a few former Cheeseboard employees who said the hell with the collective and started serving alcohol, making it a great place to watch a game and have a drink. Won't be a stretch to say that they took a few things with them - mainly the concept of one type of vegetarian pizza daily and that amazing green sauce!The pizza is amazing. Yes, some days are better than others but this is subjective and depends on your pizza preferences. But what's better than an amazing pizza? Amazing pizza you can share with friends while drinking a cold one and watching the game. This is where the two concepts diverge. One is not better than the other, it just depends on what you prefer in the specific case. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Is it a bit overhyped? Sure, but it mostly delivers."
101,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE. It's so hard to chew that my jaw literally hurts so much I don't even want to eat anymore. It's like chewing on cardboard.I definitely DO NOT want to come back here and would rather eat some Dominos, Pizza Hut, pls anything else but this."
102,"I got Sliver delivered by Caviar. The whole pie was 24$ plus taxes $2 something and $4 something for service fee plus 2$ tip. So even though Delivery was free the total charge for whole pizza came out to 33$ for me. Not cheap at all. Probably won't get it delivered again. Today's pizza had potatoes, caramelized onions (according to the menu but I couldn't taste it at all), goat cheese, mozzarella and olive oil. The whole pie came with 2 slivers (1 extra slice) which was a nice touch. The pizza was good and cilantro sauce was yum. It's basically chutney (Indian sauce lol). Overall,Not the best pizza I've had by far but it was good. Definitely wasn't worth what I spent on it."

I could eat pizza everyday and this was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas that I have tried. I'm so heartbroken that I don't live anywhere near here because this would for sure be my go to place. The way this place works is that they have one flavor that they serve a day and that's it. And while that may not seem appealing at first it's like a mini adventure to try something that you might not have ever thought of ordering before. Every time I walked by this place it seemed like it was completely packed and every table was taken so that already is a pretty good sign that you're in for something good.About half of a full pizza was about $12 and even sharing that with two people was more than enough especially with the extra slivers that you get on top.I went here on a Thursday so when I went the pizza of the day was the roasted Yukon gold potato pizza. When I first heard that they were gonna be putting potatoes on my pizza I was a little hesitant but after taking one bite I was completely sold. You 100% have to get the green sauce to go with your pizza. It  enhances the flavor so well and makes it 10x better. If you don't use it you're doing it wrong. Can't wait to try the other pizzas of the day when I go back to visit."
126,"I absolutely love this pizza place. I might be a bit sentimental, but I've spent a lot of time with some of my best friends at Slivers. They give you a sliver of pizza every time you order a slice, or two slivers if you order a whole pizza. The first time I had it, I didn't even realize I was eating a vegetarian pizza! Everyday they have a different pizza, and they only serve one type of pizza a day. Super unique, and very efficient. If you like a bit of kick to your pizza, try their green sauce next to the water. It goes so well with any of their pizzas. If you want to find me in Berkeley, Slivers is where I'll be."
127,"3.5 round up / We came here bc the line for Cheeseboard intimidated us. Today's special had corn!!!!! Corn on  pizza is the best. The cilantro green sauce was also good. The line was really short but the service for the bar was quite slow. They check IDs for each beer *_* I'm old af. Below average beer selection. Good place for college or high school dates, lol.I don't actually understand the hype of this place and would only recommend if you are craving pizza in the area."
128,"I came here during memorial day on a recommendation that this is one of the best pizza places in Berkeley. It seems like any other pizza joint styles places with a good beer selection, tv, and pizza. At this point you don't have a menu, you have one pizza. We ordered the half pizza and got 2 slices for free. It seem pretty awesome to get some extra pizza. I enjoyed the ambiance of the pizza place ; Sports bar. Parking is tricky here in the sense that its street parking if you're lucky or the paid parking lot across the street. I came here for lunch when it just opened so it wasn't crowded but given that this is a college town I can see how crowded this gets. I loved the pizza. However I do like my freedom of choice and not being told what to eat. Though this is like a omakase style pizza joint, I'd prefer creating my own pizza place. But if I'm back in Berkeley I would hit up Sliver again or Cheeseboard.GO BEARS!"
129,"I came here on a weekday in the late afternoon to grab a single slice before getting on the Bart. Sliver only offers one flavor of pizza each day and the flavor changes every single day. When I went, the flavor was ""crimini mushrooms, yellow onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, fresh herbs, infused rosemary & chanterelle mushroom olive oil"".The slice comes with a small ""sliver"" on top, which is a nice bonus. The pizza was really oily, so I had to grab some napkins to blot off the oil. The pizza was quite aromatic because of the mushroom olive oil that they used, along with the actual mushrooms on top. The pizza was tasty and flavorful, but I personally didn't find it to be extraordinary and worth the $3.25 (including tax)."
130,"I heard a lot of great things about this place! I went on a Saturday before the lunch rush. I order the special pizza for the day. It had pineapple, arugula, mozzarella and something else. I was surprised when the pizza was tough and hard to bite into. I didn't think it tasted that good. The good thing was the pesto sauce they have on the side. I had to dip my pizza in that so it had some flavor! It could be just this day and the special they had. I see on the menu some of the other specials and it looks bomb. I would come back and try another pizza."
131,"One type of pizza everyday, $3.25 per slice plus you get a little extra sliver. Water dispenser. Delicious pesto sauce condiment. Great outdoor seating as well.Came here to grab a quick bite before a graduation ceremony and was glad to have a full belly."
132,"Sliver is a vegetarian pizza place that serves one type of tasty pizza a day. My favorite flavor so far is definitely the potato and corn, but the other types are also unique and delicious. Occasionally, there are also new unique combinations that feature ingredients like peaches or blue cheese (super interesting to try, you could always buy a slice to try and eat somewhere else closeby if you don't like it). I usually check online to see what flavors they're serving each day that week, since I definitely prefer some pizzas over others. Along with that, there's a green sauce that's a great addition to the the cheesy non-marinara pizzas. They also serve frescas now, which are refreshing and not overly sweet.It's probably important to note that this place is very similar to Cheeseboard, in pizza and concept. Though it's still a quick and affordable place (especially closer to campus) for some delicious pizza."
133,"Pizza here reminds me of their East Bay neighbors The Cheese Board, Arizmendi Bakery, and Nabolom Bakery. All of them are serving one type of vegetarian pizza daily and aiming to create a community around good food including pizza. Prices are more or less similar too.Like The Cheese Board and Nabolom, their green sauce is a must try. Spicy sauce fans forget red chili pepper flakes and grab a few containers of their sauce.What sets Sliver Pizzeria from the rest is the setting. It's a sports bar with a full bar inside, TVs with sports on, long community tables, happy hour specials, and live music Friday's and Saturday's. If you're not in the mood, you can always get it to go or sit outside.I personally prefer Nabolom and Arizmendi's crust, but the pizza here is still solid. Plus, you gotta love those extra baby slices with your pizza."
134,"Food 4/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Bang for your buck 4/5. A great place to catch the games and get some pizzas with high quality ingredients. Note this place only has vegetarian pizza and one flavor per day. Check on their website to see which flavor is showcased today! On any given day, Sliver can get pretty busy, and even busier on days when there is a game playing. However, the line usually moves pretty rapidly because pizzas are continuously being baked. But, you might have a hard time find seating. If it does happen don't worry, it it's a nice day out bring your pizza on the front lawn of UC Berkeley. The one thing that makes it special is they actually provide two slivers with your slice of whole pizza, and hence the name. A really good deal is actually getting a slice of pizza and a salad. All the flavors are really good with top notch ingredients but I usually avoid days where they have tomatoes as a topping, as it doesn't add much to the pizza. I usually go for days where the toppings either include potatoes, or mushrooms or corn (best days). My own trope is that their pizza can get pretty oily because of the cheese. However, the green sauce that you can scoop yourself is pretty amazing and helps tame the oils from the pizza. Overall, it's a solid place to get pizza. I only wished sometimes that they did a meat pizza but I guess you can't have it all. Tips - Its cheaper to get a full pizza for $20 and share it between friends! Pros - High quality ingredients and with only one flavor you don't have to decide which flavor you want! Cons - the pizza can get oily but the green sauce help mitigate that."
135,"Pizza is OK but kinda inconsistent.  We stayed at the restaurant for a couple of hours to watch a warrior game.  The first pizza was good while the second one too oily, had way too much cheese,  and was a little undercooked.   I do like the green sauce but do not like the fact that there is only one type of pizza per day.Happy hour is 3PM - 6PM, you get pizza slivers with your order of alcohol."
136,"Their pizza is very much worth the hype! Always vegetarian and made fresh daily, their changing daily menu makes it easy to go every day. Their website is updated with the menu schedule for the week, so make sure to check it before you go! Their crust itself is more of a flatbread style rather than a fluffy crust style, and is slightly greasier than I'd like, but not more than is expected of a typical pizza. Either way, their pairing of toppings is impeccable, and each one is a delight. My personal favorite is the corn pizza, which I like to drizzle some of their pesto and squeeze a hint of lime on. The only thing is the lines can get pretty crazy during peak times, but service is quick."
137,"My boyfriend took me here as a ""must-go"" staple in Berkeley and I didn't know what to expect! The pizza was SO good - albeit a bit oily, but it's pizza (what do you expect). I had no idea what I was eating (what toppings) because we went in, got 2 slices of pizza, was handed the pizza and then walked out to proceed with our Berkeley food tour. Apparently the pizza of the day was something with kalamata olives (which I thought were some sort of meat) but ALL THEIR PIZZAS ARE VEGETARIAN ! I hope this place continues to change people's perceptions of vegetarian pizzas being less flavorful, delicious or desirable because this pizza was definitely better than many of the meat-included pizzas I've had in my LIFETIME. Definitely worth the visit, prices are reasonable because you're in a college town, good quality, would 10/10 recommend."
138,"The green sauce!!! Sliver's green sauce is the main reason I want to eat here all the time.(For reference, I have never tried Cheese Board)Sliver changes their pizza toppings daily, so check their website before going in if you're a picky eater! My favorite pizzas are the ones topped with corn and mushrooms. Their pizzas are more like cheesy bread (think of a flatter version of the cheese bread at Sweet Tomatoes). They have a thin crust with a generous amount of cheese + a sparse sprinkle of toppings. Their sauce is the reason I keep coming back--it's tangy with a bit of heat. It's the perfect compliment to their cheesy pizza and would taste good on practically anything.For the price (a bit over $20 for a whole pizza or a few bucks for slice), I do wish that they'd be more generous with the toppings. Also, from a value perspective, not the most cost-efficient which is why I'm giving it 4-stars."
139,"I've been to Sliver Pizzeria over 5 times and I've never had a bad pizza.  Some pizzas are tastier than others though.  Check out Sliver's website to see the pizza of the day!  Sliver only sells one type of pizza each day and the pizza is always vegetarian!  Be sure to warn any meat lovers you may be taking to Sliver with you.  I didn't warn my Filipino meat-loving mom when I took her to Sliver and she was shocked that there weren't any meat pizzas available.  She said she was going to go to Top Dog nearby to get a hot dog to fill her need for meat. -__-  Anyway, when you eat the pizza at Sliver, be sure to put some of the free green sauce on it.  The pizza is not complete without the green sauce.  Also, if you plan to drink alcohol at Sliver, I do not recommend the sangria.  It just tasted like juice and there were no visible fruits in the drink...  It could've been better."
140,"Sliver, the place started by a few former Cheeseboard employees who said the hell with the collective and started serving alcohol, making it a great place to watch a game and have a drink. Won't be a stretch to say that they took a few things with them - mainly the concept of one type of vegetarian pizza daily and that amazing green sauce!The pizza is amazing. Yes, some days are better than others but this is subjective and depends on your pizza preferences. But what's better than an amazing pizza? Amazing pizza you can share with friends while drinking a cold one and watching the game. This is where the two concepts diverge. One is not better than the other, it just depends on what you prefer in the specific case. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Is it a bit overhyped? Sure, but it mostly delivers."
141,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE. It's so hard to chew that my jaw literally hurts so much I don't even want to eat anymore. It's like chewing on cardboard.I definitely DO NOT want to come back here and would rather eat some Dominos, Pizza Hut, pls anything else but this."
142,"I got Sliver delivered by Caviar. The whole pie was 24$ plus taxes $2 something and $4 something for service fee plus 2$ tip. So even though Delivery was free the total charge for whole pizza came out to 33$ for me. Not cheap at all. Probably won't get it delivered again. Today's pizza had potatoes, caramelized onions (according to the menu but I couldn't taste it at all), goat cheese, mozzarella and olive oil. The whole pie came with 2 slivers (1 extra slice) which was a nice touch. The pizza was good and cilantro sauce was yum. It's basically chutney (Indian sauce lol). Overall,Not the best pizza I've had by far but it was good. Definitely wasn't worth what I spent on it."
143,"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Since they've only got one kind of pizza a day the only decision you have to make is how much to order! Another positive to this method is that it's ready immediately - they've just got hot pizzas waiting to be plated.  Between my boyfriend and I, we split a half and I ended up taking home a slice.  Totally reasonable prices - the half was not much more than $12, and they were very generous.There were a lot of flies inside, but what can you expect for a sports bar?  This is a casual spot and clearly popular with all the cal students.  We ate in but will probably do take out next time because parking kind of sucks in the area.They've got an amazing cilantro sauce that goes on the pizza that I would recommend to anyone (even cilantro haters, like myself)!  Love that you don't have to ask for water cups, and there's foil and paper bags to wrap your leftovers in.  Will definitely be back!"

You 100% have to get the green sauce to go with your pizza. It  enhances the flavor so well and makes it 10x better. If you don't use it you're doing it wrong. Can't wait to try the other pizzas of the day when I go back to visit."
166,"I absolutely love this pizza place. I might be a bit sentimental, but I've spent a lot of time with some of my best friends at Slivers. They give you a sliver of pizza every time you order a slice, or two slivers if you order a whole pizza. The first time I had it, I didn't even realize I was eating a vegetarian pizza! Everyday they have a different pizza, and they only serve one type of pizza a day. Super unique, and very efficient. If you like a bit of kick to your pizza, try their green sauce next to the water. It goes so well with any of their pizzas. If you want to find me in Berkeley, Slivers is where I'll be."
167,"3.5 round up / We came here bc the line for Cheeseboard intimidated us. Today's special had corn!!!!! Corn on  pizza is the best. The cilantro green sauce was also good. The line was really short but the service for the bar was quite slow. They check IDs for each beer *_* I'm old af. Below average beer selection. Good place for college or high school dates, lol.I don't actually understand the hype of this place and would only recommend if you are craving pizza in the area."
168,"I came here during memorial day on a recommendation that this is one of the best pizza places in Berkeley. It seems like any other pizza joint styles places with a good beer selection, tv, and pizza. At this point you don't have a menu, you have one pizza. We ordered the half pizza and got 2 slices for free. It seem pretty awesome to get some extra pizza. I enjoyed the ambiance of the pizza place ; Sports bar. Parking is tricky here in the sense that its street parking if you're lucky or the paid parking lot across the street. I came here for lunch when it just opened so it wasn't crowded but given that this is a college town I can see how crowded this gets. I loved the pizza. However I do like my freedom of choice and not being told what to eat. Though this is like a omakase style pizza joint, I'd prefer creating my own pizza place. But if I'm back in Berkeley I would hit up Sliver again or Cheeseboard.GO BEARS!"
169,"I came here on a weekday in the late afternoon to grab a single slice before getting on the Bart. Sliver only offers one flavor of pizza each day and the flavor changes every single day. When I went, the flavor was ""crimini mushrooms, yellow onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, fresh herbs, infused rosemary & chanterelle mushroom olive oil"".The slice comes with a small ""sliver"" on top, which is a nice bonus. The pizza was really oily, so I had to grab some napkins to blot off the oil. The pizza was quite aromatic because of the mushroom olive oil that they used, along with the actual mushrooms on top. The pizza was tasty and flavorful, but I personally didn't find it to be extraordinary and worth the $3.25 (including tax)."
170,"I heard a lot of great things about this place! I went on a Saturday before the lunch rush. I order the special pizza for the day. It had pineapple, arugula, mozzarella and something else. I was surprised when the pizza was tough and hard to bite into. I didn't think it tasted that good. The good thing was the pesto sauce they have on the side. I had to dip my pizza in that so it had some flavor! It could be just this day and the special they had. I see on the menu some of the other specials and it looks bomb. I would come back and try another pizza."
171,"One type of pizza everyday, $3.25 per slice plus you get a little extra sliver. Water dispenser. Delicious pesto sauce condiment. Great outdoor seating as well.Came here to grab a quick bite before a graduation ceremony and was glad to have a full belly."
172,"Sliver is a vegetarian pizza place that serves one type of tasty pizza a day. My favorite flavor so far is definitely the potato and corn, but the other types are also unique and delicious. Occasionally, there are also new unique combinations that feature ingredients like peaches or blue cheese (super interesting to try, you could always buy a slice to try and eat somewhere else closeby if you don't like it). I usually check online to see what flavors they're serving each day that week, since I definitely prefer some pizzas over others. Along with that, there's a green sauce that's a great addition to the the cheesy non-marinara pizzas. They also serve frescas now, which are refreshing and not overly sweet.It's probably important to note that this place is very similar to Cheeseboard, in pizza and concept. Though it's still a quick and affordable place (especially closer to campus) for some delicious pizza."
173,"Pizza here reminds me of their East Bay neighbors The Cheese Board, Arizmendi Bakery, and Nabolom Bakery. All of them are serving one type of vegetarian pizza daily and aiming to create a community around good food including pizza. Prices are more or less similar too.Like The Cheese Board and Nabolom, their green sauce is a must try. Spicy sauce fans forget red chili pepper flakes and grab a few containers of their sauce.What sets Sliver Pizzeria from the rest is the setting. It's a sports bar with a full bar inside, TVs with sports on, long community tables, happy hour specials, and live music Friday's and Saturday's. If you're not in the mood, you can always get it to go or sit outside.I personally prefer Nabolom and Arizmendi's crust, but the pizza here is still solid. Plus, you gotta love those extra baby slices with your pizza."
174,"Food 4/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Bang for your buck 4/5. A great place to catch the games and get some pizzas with high quality ingredients. Note this place only has vegetarian pizza and one flavor per day. Check on their website to see which flavor is showcased today! On any given day, Sliver can get pretty busy, and even busier on days when there is a game playing. However, the line usually moves pretty rapidly because pizzas are continuously being baked. But, you might have a hard time find seating. If it does happen don't worry, it it's a nice day out bring your pizza on the front lawn of UC Berkeley. The one thing that makes it special is they actually provide two slivers with your slice of whole pizza, and hence the name. A really good deal is actually getting a slice of pizza and a salad. All the flavors are really good with top notch ingredients but I usually avoid days where they have tomatoes as a topping, as it doesn't add much to the pizza. I usually go for days where the toppings either include potatoes, or mushrooms or corn (best days). My own trope is that their pizza can get pretty oily because of the cheese. However, the green sauce that you can scoop yourself is pretty amazing and helps tame the oils from the pizza. Overall, it's a solid place to get pizza. I only wished sometimes that they did a meat pizza but I guess you can't have it all. Tips - Its cheaper to get a full pizza for $20 and share it between friends! Pros - High quality ingredients and with only one flavor you don't have to decide which flavor you want! Cons - the pizza can get oily but the green sauce help mitigate that."
175,"Pizza is OK but kinda inconsistent.  We stayed at the restaurant for a couple of hours to watch a warrior game.  The first pizza was good while the second one too oily, had way too much cheese,  and was a little undercooked.   I do like the green sauce but do not like the fact that there is only one type of pizza per day.Happy hour is 3PM - 6PM, you get pizza slivers with your order of alcohol."
176,"Their pizza is very much worth the hype! Always vegetarian and made fresh daily, their changing daily menu makes it easy to go every day. Their website is updated with the menu schedule for the week, so make sure to check it before you go! Their crust itself is more of a flatbread style rather than a fluffy crust style, and is slightly greasier than I'd like, but not more than is expected of a typical pizza. Either way, their pairing of toppings is impeccable, and each one is a delight. My personal favorite is the corn pizza, which I like to drizzle some of their pesto and squeeze a hint of lime on. The only thing is the lines can get pretty crazy during peak times, but service is quick."
177,"My boyfriend took me here as a ""must-go"" staple in Berkeley and I didn't know what to expect! The pizza was SO good - albeit a bit oily, but it's pizza (what do you expect). I had no idea what I was eating (what toppings) because we went in, got 2 slices of pizza, was handed the pizza and then walked out to proceed with our Berkeley food tour. Apparently the pizza of the day was something with kalamata olives (which I thought were some sort of meat) but ALL THEIR PIZZAS ARE VEGETARIAN ! I hope this place continues to change people's perceptions of vegetarian pizzas being less flavorful, delicious or desirable because this pizza was definitely better than many of the meat-included pizzas I've had in my LIFETIME. Definitely worth the visit, prices are reasonable because you're in a college town, good quality, would 10/10 recommend."
178,"The green sauce!!! Sliver's green sauce is the main reason I want to eat here all the time.(For reference, I have never tried Cheese Board)Sliver changes their pizza toppings daily, so check their website before going in if you're a picky eater! My favorite pizzas are the ones topped with corn and mushrooms. Their pizzas are more like cheesy bread (think of a flatter version of the cheese bread at Sweet Tomatoes). They have a thin crust with a generous amount of cheese + a sparse sprinkle of toppings. Their sauce is the reason I keep coming back--it's tangy with a bit of heat. It's the perfect compliment to their cheesy pizza and would taste good on practically anything.For the price (a bit over $20 for a whole pizza or a few bucks for slice), I do wish that they'd be more generous with the toppings. Also, from a value perspective, not the most cost-efficient which is why I'm giving it 4-stars."
179,"I've been to Sliver Pizzeria over 5 times and I've never had a bad pizza.  Some pizzas are tastier than others though.  Check out Sliver's website to see the pizza of the day!  Sliver only sells one type of pizza each day and the pizza is always vegetarian!  Be sure to warn any meat lovers you may be taking to Sliver with you.  I didn't warn my Filipino meat-loving mom when I took her to Sliver and she was shocked that there weren't any meat pizzas available.  She said she was going to go to Top Dog nearby to get a hot dog to fill her need for meat. -__-  Anyway, when you eat the pizza at Sliver, be sure to put some of the free green sauce on it.  The pizza is not complete without the green sauce.  Also, if you plan to drink alcohol at Sliver, I do not recommend the sangria.  It just tasted like juice and there were no visible fruits in the drink...  It could've been better."
180,"Sliver, the place started by a few former Cheeseboard employees who said the hell with the collective and started serving alcohol, making it a great place to watch a game and have a drink. Won't be a stretch to say that they took a few things with them - mainly the concept of one type of vegetarian pizza daily and that amazing green sauce!The pizza is amazing. Yes, some days are better than others but this is subjective and depends on your pizza preferences. But what's better than an amazing pizza? Amazing pizza you can share with friends while drinking a cold one and watching the game. This is where the two concepts diverge. One is not better than the other, it just depends on what you prefer in the specific case. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Is it a bit overhyped? Sure, but it mostly delivers."
181,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE. It's so hard to chew that my jaw literally hurts so much I don't even want to eat anymore. It's like chewing on cardboard.I definitely DO NOT want to come back here and would rather eat some Dominos, Pizza Hut, pls anything else but this."
182,"I got Sliver delivered by Caviar. The whole pie was 24$ plus taxes $2 something and $4 something for service fee plus 2$ tip. So even though Delivery was free the total charge for whole pizza came out to 33$ for me. Not cheap at all. Probably won't get it delivered again. Today's pizza had potatoes, caramelized onions (according to the menu but I couldn't taste it at all), goat cheese, mozzarella and olive oil. The whole pie came with 2 slivers (1 extra slice) which was a nice touch. The pizza was good and cilantro sauce was yum. It's basically chutney (Indian sauce lol). Overall,Not the best pizza I've had by far but it was good. Definitely wasn't worth what I spent on it."
183,"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Since they've only got one kind of pizza a day the only decision you have to make is how much to order! Another positive to this method is that it's ready immediately - they've just got hot pizzas waiting to be plated.  Between my boyfriend and I, we split a half and I ended up taking home a slice.  Totally reasonable prices - the half was not much more than $12, and they were very generous.There were a lot of flies inside, but what can you expect for a sports bar?  This is a casual spot and clearly popular with all the cal students.  We ate in but will probably do take out next time because parking kind of sucks in the area.They've got an amazing cilantro sauce that goes on the pizza that I would recommend to anyone (even cilantro haters, like myself)!  Love that you don't have to ask for water cups, and there's foil and paper bags to wrap your leftovers in.  Will definitely be back!"
184,"TL;DR 1 AWESOME vegetarian pizza/dayWhat is Sliver:They serve 1 vegetarian pizza each day. Meat lovers: don't be afraid, it will be great, and it will satisfy you.PLUSES:+ location: DT Berkeley, next to BART station & Cal+ vegetarian!! + crust + toppings are awesome, their 1 flavor a day pizza has never disappointed+ check online to see what the toppings of the day are+ their long line can be intimidating, but goes by pretty fastDELTAS:- Not as good as Cheese....."
185,"Oh my god, the green sauce!!! That was the biggest game changer for this place. I first went here when I was visiting my boyfriend in Berkeley. I could eat pizza everyday and this was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas that I have tried. I'm so heartbroken that I don't live anywhere near here because this would for sure be my go to place. The way this place works is that they have one flavor that they serve a day and that's it. And while that may not seem appealing at first it's like a mini adventure to try something that you might not have ever thought of ordering before.

207,"3.5 round up / We came here bc the line for Cheeseboard intimidated us. Today's special had corn!!!!! Corn on  pizza is the best. The cilantro green sauce was also good. The line was really short but the service for the bar was quite slow. They check IDs for each beer *_* I'm old af. Below average beer selection. Good place for college or high school dates, lol.I don't actually understand the hype of this place and would only recommend if you are craving pizza in the area."
208,"I came here during memorial day on a recommendation that this is one of the best pizza places in Berkeley. It seems like any other pizza joint styles places with a good beer selection, tv, and pizza. At this point you don't have a menu, you have one pizza. We ordered the half pizza and got 2 slices for free. It seem pretty awesome to get some extra pizza. I enjoyed the ambiance of the pizza place ; Sports bar. Parking is tricky here in the sense that its street parking if you're lucky or the paid parking lot across the street. I came here for lunch when it just opened so it wasn't crowded but given that this is a college town I can see how crowded this gets. I loved the pizza. However I do like my freedom of choice and not being told what to eat. Though this is like a omakase style pizza joint, I'd prefer creating my own pizza place. But if I'm back in Berkeley I would hit up Sliver again or Cheeseboard.GO BEARS!"
209,"I came here on a weekday in the late afternoon to grab a single slice before getting on the Bart. Sliver only offers one flavor of pizza each day and the flavor changes every single day. When I went, the flavor was ""crimini mushrooms, yellow onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, fresh herbs, infused rosemary & chanterelle mushroom olive oil"".The slice comes with a small ""sliver"" on top, which is a nice bonus. The pizza was really oily, so I had to grab some napkins to blot off the oil. The pizza was quite aromatic because of the mushroom olive oil that they used, along with the actual mushrooms on top. The pizza was tasty and flavorful, but I personally didn't find it to be extraordinary and worth the $3.25 (including tax)."
210,"I heard a lot of great things about this place! I went on a Saturday before the lunch rush. I order the special pizza for the day. It had pineapple, arugula, mozzarella and something else. I was surprised when the pizza was tough and hard to bite into. I didn't think it tasted that good. The good thing was the pesto sauce they have on the side. I had to dip my pizza in that so it had some flavor! It could be just this day and the special they had. I see on the menu some of the other specials and it looks bomb. I would come back and try another pizza."
211,"One type of pizza everyday, $3.25 per slice plus you get a little extra sliver. Water dispenser. Delicious pesto sauce condiment. Great outdoor seating as well.Came here to grab a quick bite before a graduation ceremony and was glad to have a full belly."
212,"Sliver is a vegetarian pizza place that serves one type of tasty pizza a day. My favorite flavor so far is definitely the potato and corn, but the other types are also unique and delicious. Occasionally, there are also new unique combinations that feature ingredients like peaches or blue cheese (super interesting to try, you could always buy a slice to try and eat somewhere else closeby if you don't like it). I usually check online to see what flavors they're serving each day that week, since I definitely prefer some pizzas over others. Along with that, there's a green sauce that's a great addition to the the cheesy non-marinara pizzas. They also serve frescas now, which are refreshing and not overly sweet.It's probably important to note that this place is very similar to Cheeseboard, in pizza and concept. Though it's still a quick and affordable place (especially closer to campus) for some delicious pizza."
213,"Pizza here reminds me of their East Bay neighbors The Cheese Board, Arizmendi Bakery, and Nabolom Bakery. All of them are serving one type of vegetarian pizza daily and aiming to create a community around good food including pizza. Prices are more or less similar too.Like The Cheese Board and Nabolom, their green sauce is a must try. Spicy sauce fans forget red chili pepper flakes and grab a few containers of their sauce.What sets Sliver Pizzeria from the rest is the setting. It's a sports bar with a full bar inside, TVs with sports on, long community tables, happy hour specials, and live music Friday's and Saturday's. If you're not in the mood, you can always get it to go or sit outside.I personally prefer Nabolom and Arizmendi's crust, but the pizza here is still solid. Plus, you gotta love those extra baby slices with your pizza."
214,"Food 4/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Bang for your buck 4/5. A great place to catch the games and get some pizzas with high quality ingredients. Note this place only has vegetarian pizza and one flavor per day. Check on their website to see which flavor is showcased today! On any given day, Sliver can get pretty busy, and even busier on days when there is a game playing. However, the line usually moves pretty rapidly because pizzas are continuously being baked. But, you might have a hard time find seating. If it does happen don't worry, it it's a nice day out bring your pizza on the front lawn of UC Berkeley. The one thing that makes it special is they actually provide two slivers with your slice of whole pizza, and hence the name. A really good deal is actually getting a slice of pizza and a salad. All the flavors are really good with top notch ingredients but I usually avoid days where they have tomatoes as a topping, as it doesn't add much to the pizza. I usually go for days where the toppings either include potatoes, or mushrooms or corn (best days). My own trope is that their pizza can get pretty oily because of the cheese. However, the green sauce that you can scoop yourself is pretty amazing and helps tame the oils from the pizza. Overall, it's a solid place to get pizza. I only wished sometimes that they did a meat pizza but I guess you can't have it all. Tips - Its cheaper to get a full pizza for $20 and share it between friends! Pros - High quality ingredients and with only one flavor you don't have to decide which flavor you want! Cons - the pizza can get oily but the green sauce help mitigate that."
215,"Pizza is OK but kinda inconsistent.  We stayed at the restaurant for a couple of hours to watch a warrior game.  The first pizza was good while the second one too oily, had way too much cheese,  and was a little undercooked.   I do like the green sauce but do not like the fact that there is only one type of pizza per day.Happy hour is 3PM - 6PM, you get pizza slivers with your order of alcohol."
216,"Their pizza is very much worth the hype! Always vegetarian and made fresh daily, their changing daily menu makes it easy to go every day. Their website is updated with the menu schedule for the week, so make sure to check it before you go! Their crust itself is more of a flatbread style rather than a fluffy crust style, and is slightly greasier than I'd like, but not more than is expected of a typical pizza. Either way, their pairing of toppings is impeccable, and each one is a delight. My personal favorite is the corn pizza, which I like to drizzle some of their pesto and squeeze a hint of lime on. The only thing is the lines can get pretty crazy during peak times, but service is quick."
217,"My boyfriend took me here as a ""must-go"" staple in Berkeley and I didn't know what to expect! The pizza was SO good - albeit a bit oily, but it's pizza (what do you expect). I had no idea what I was eating (what toppings) because we went in, got 2 slices of pizza, was handed the pizza and then walked out to proceed with our Berkeley food tour. Apparently the pizza of the day was something with kalamata olives (which I thought were some sort of meat) but ALL THEIR PIZZAS ARE VEGETARIAN ! I hope this place continues to change people's perceptions of vegetarian pizzas being less flavorful, delicious or desirable because this pizza was definitely better than many of the meat-included pizzas I've had in my LIFETIME. Definitely worth the visit, prices are reasonable because you're in a college town, good quality, would 10/10 recommend."
218,"The green sauce!!! Sliver's green sauce is the main reason I want to eat here all the time.(For reference, I have never tried Cheese Board)Sliver changes their pizza toppings daily, so check their website before going in if you're a picky eater! My favorite pizzas are the ones topped with corn and mushrooms. Their pizzas are more like cheesy bread (think of a flatter version of the cheese bread at Sweet Tomatoes). They have a thin crust with a generous amount of cheese + a sparse sprinkle of toppings. Their sauce is the reason I keep coming back--it's tangy with a bit of heat. It's the perfect compliment to their cheesy pizza and would taste good on practically anything.For the price (a bit over $20 for a whole pizza or a few bucks for slice), I do wish that they'd be more generous with the toppings. Also, from a value perspective, not the most cost-efficient which is why I'm giving it 4-stars."
219,"I've been to Sliver Pizzeria over 5 times and I've never had a bad pizza.  Some pizzas are tastier than others though.  Check out Sliver's website to see the pizza of the day!  Sliver only sells one type of pizza each day and the pizza is always vegetarian!  Be sure to warn any meat lovers you may be taking to Sliver with you.  I didn't warn my Filipino meat-loving mom when I took her to Sliver and she was shocked that there weren't any meat pizzas available.  She said she was going to go to Top Dog nearby to get a hot dog to fill her need for meat. -__-  Anyway, when you eat the pizza at Sliver, be sure to put some of the free green sauce on it.  The pizza is not complete without the green sauce.  Also, if you plan to drink alcohol at Sliver, I do not recommend the sangria.  It just tasted like juice and there were no visible fruits in the drink...  It could've been better."
220,"Sliver, the place started by a few former Cheeseboard employees who said the hell with the collective and started serving alcohol, making it a great place to watch a game and have a drink. Won't be a stretch to say that they took a few things with them - mainly the concept of one type of vegetarian pizza daily and that amazing green sauce!The pizza is amazing. Yes, some days are better than others but this is subjective and depends on your pizza preferences. But what's better than an amazing pizza? Amazing pizza you can share with friends while drinking a cold one and watching the game. This is where the two concepts diverge. One is not better than the other, it just depends on what you prefer in the specific case. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Is it a bit overhyped? Sure, but it mostly delivers."
221,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE. It's so hard to chew that my jaw literally hurts so much I don't even want to eat anymore. It's like chewing on cardboard.I definitely DO NOT want to come back here and would rather eat some Dominos, Pizza Hut, pls anything else but this."
222,"I got Sliver delivered by Caviar. The whole pie was 24$ plus taxes $2 something and $4 something for service fee plus 2$ tip. So even though Delivery was free the total charge for whole pizza came out to 33$ for me. Not cheap at all. Probably won't get it delivered again. Today's pizza had potatoes, caramelized onions (according to the menu but I couldn't taste it at all), goat cheese, mozzarella and olive oil. The whole pie came with 2 slivers (1 extra slice) which was a nice touch. The pizza was good and cilantro sauce was yum. It's basically chutney (Indian sauce lol). Overall,Not the best pizza I've had by far but it was good. Definitely wasn't worth what I spent on it."
223,"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Since they've only got one kind of pizza a day the only decision you have to make is how much to order! Another positive to this method is that it's ready immediately - they've just got hot pizzas waiting to be plated.  Between my boyfriend and I, we split a half and I ended up taking home a slice.  Totally reasonable prices - the half was not much more than $12, and they were very generous.There were a lot of flies inside, but what can you expect for a sports bar?  This is a casual spot and clearly popular with all the cal students.  We ate in but will probably do take out next time because parking kind of sucks in the area.They've got an amazing cilantro sauce that goes on the pizza that I would recommend to anyone (even cilantro haters, like myself)!  Love that you don't have to ask for water cups, and there's foil and paper bags to wrap your leftovers in.  Will definitely be back!"
224,"TL;DR 1 AWESOME vegetarian pizza/dayWhat is Sliver:They serve 1 vegetarian pizza each day. Meat lovers: don't be afraid, it will be great, and it will satisfy you.PLUSES:+ location: DT Berkeley, next to BART station & Cal+ vegetarian!! + crust + toppings are awesome, their 1 flavor a day pizza has never disappointed+ check online to see what the toppings of the day are+ their long line can be intimidating, but goes by pretty fastDELTAS:- Not as good as Cheese....."
225,"Oh my god, the green sauce!!! That was the biggest game changer for this place. I first went here when I was visiting my boyfriend in Berkeley. I could eat pizza everyday and this was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas that I have tried. I'm so heartbroken that I don't live anywhere near here because this would for sure be my go to place. The way this place works is that they have one flavor that they serve a day and that's it. And while that may not seem appealing at first it's like a mini adventure to try something that you might not have ever thought of ordering before. Every time I walked by this place it seemed like it was completely packed and every table was taken so that already is a pretty good sign that you're in for something good.About half of a full pizza was about $12 and even sharing that with two people was more than enough especially with the extra slivers that you get on top.I went here on a Thursday so when I went the pizza of the day was the roasted Yukon gold potato pizza. When I first heard that they were gonna be putting potatoes on my pizza I was a little hesitant but after taking one bite I was completely sold. You 100% have to get the green sauce to go with your pizza. It  enhances the flavor so well and makes it 10x better. If you don't use it you're doing it wrong. Can't wait to try the other pizzas of the day when I go back to visit."
226,"I absolutely love this pizza place. I might be a bit sentimental, but I've spent a lot of time with some of my best friends at Slivers.

However I do like my freedom of choice and not being told what to eat. Though this is like a omakase style pizza joint, I'd prefer creating my own pizza place. But if I'm back in Berkeley I would hit up Sliver again or Cheeseboard.GO BEARS!"
249,"I came here on a weekday in the late afternoon to grab a single slice before getting on the Bart. Sliver only offers one flavor of pizza each day and the flavor changes every single day. When I went, the flavor was ""crimini mushrooms, yellow onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, fresh herbs, infused rosemary & chanterelle mushroom olive oil"".The slice comes with a small ""sliver"" on top, which is a nice bonus. The pizza was really oily, so I had to grab some napkins to blot off the oil. The pizza was quite aromatic because of the mushroom olive oil that they used, along with the actual mushrooms on top. The pizza was tasty and flavorful, but I personally didn't find it to be extraordinary and worth the $3.25 (including tax)."
250,"I heard a lot of great things about this place! I went on a Saturday before the lunch rush. I order the special pizza for the day. It had pineapple, arugula, mozzarella and something else. I was surprised when the pizza was tough and hard to bite into. I didn't think it tasted that good. The good thing was the pesto sauce they have on the side. I had to dip my pizza in that so it had some flavor! It could be just this day and the special they had. I see on the menu some of the other specials and it looks bomb. I would come back and try another pizza."
251,"One type of pizza everyday, $3.25 per slice plus you get a little extra sliver. Water dispenser. Delicious pesto sauce condiment. Great outdoor seating as well.Came here to grab a quick bite before a graduation ceremony and was glad to have a full belly."
252,"Sliver is a vegetarian pizza place that serves one type of tasty pizza a day. My favorite flavor so far is definitely the potato and corn, but the other types are also unique and delicious. Occasionally, there are also new unique combinations that feature ingredients like peaches or blue cheese (super interesting to try, you could always buy a slice to try and eat somewhere else closeby if you don't like it). I usually check online to see what flavors they're serving each day that week, since I definitely prefer some pizzas over others. Along with that, there's a green sauce that's a great addition to the the cheesy non-marinara pizzas. They also serve frescas now, which are refreshing and not overly sweet.It's probably important to note that this place is very similar to Cheeseboard, in pizza and concept. Though it's still a quick and affordable place (especially closer to campus) for some delicious pizza."
253,"Pizza here reminds me of their East Bay neighbors The Cheese Board, Arizmendi Bakery, and Nabolom Bakery. All of them are serving one type of vegetarian pizza daily and aiming to create a community around good food including pizza. Prices are more or less similar too.Like The Cheese Board and Nabolom, their green sauce is a must try. Spicy sauce fans forget red chili pepper flakes and grab a few containers of their sauce.What sets Sliver Pizzeria from the rest is the setting. It's a sports bar with a full bar inside, TVs with sports on, long community tables, happy hour specials, and live music Friday's and Saturday's. If you're not in the mood, you can always get it to go or sit outside.I personally prefer Nabolom and Arizmendi's crust, but the pizza here is still solid. Plus, you gotta love those extra baby slices with your pizza."
254,"Food 4/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Bang for your buck 4/5. A great place to catch the games and get some pizzas with high quality ingredients. Note this place only has vegetarian pizza and one flavor per day. Check on their website to see which flavor is showcased today! On any given day, Sliver can get pretty busy, and even busier on days when there is a game playing. However, the line usually moves pretty rapidly because pizzas are continuously being baked. But, you might have a hard time find seating. If it does happen don't worry, it it's a nice day out bring your pizza on the front lawn of UC Berkeley. The one thing that makes it special is they actually provide two slivers with your slice of whole pizza, and hence the name. A really good deal is actually getting a slice of pizza and a salad. All the flavors are really good with top notch ingredients but I usually avoid days where they have tomatoes as a topping, as it doesn't add much to the pizza. I usually go for days where the toppings either include potatoes, or mushrooms or corn (best days). My own trope is that their pizza can get pretty oily because of the cheese. However, the green sauce that you can scoop yourself is pretty amazing and helps tame the oils from the pizza. Overall, it's a solid place to get pizza. I only wished sometimes that they did a meat pizza but I guess you can't have it all. Tips - Its cheaper to get a full pizza for $20 and share it between friends! Pros - High quality ingredients and with only one flavor you don't have to decide which flavor you want! Cons - the pizza can get oily but the green sauce help mitigate that."
255,"Pizza is OK but kinda inconsistent.  We stayed at the restaurant for a couple of hours to watch a warrior game.  The first pizza was good while the second one too oily, had way too much cheese,  and was a little undercooked.   I do like the green sauce but do not like the fact that there is only one type of pizza per day.Happy hour is 3PM - 6PM, you get pizza slivers with your order of alcohol."
256,"Their pizza is very much worth the hype! Always vegetarian and made fresh daily, their changing daily menu makes it easy to go every day. Their website is updated with the menu schedule for the week, so make sure to check it before you go! Their crust itself is more of a flatbread style rather than a fluffy crust style, and is slightly greasier than I'd like, but not more than is expected of a typical pizza. Either way, their pairing of toppings is impeccable, and each one is a delight. My personal favorite is the corn pizza, which I like to drizzle some of their pesto and squeeze a hint of lime on. The only thing is the lines can get pretty crazy during peak times, but service is quick."
257,"My boyfriend took me here as a ""must-go"" staple in Berkeley and I didn't know what to expect! The pizza was SO good - albeit a bit oily, but it's pizza (what do you expect). I had no idea what I was eating (what toppings) because we went in, got 2 slices of pizza, was handed the pizza and then walked out to proceed with our Berkeley food tour. Apparently the pizza of the day was something with kalamata olives (which I thought were some sort of meat) but ALL THEIR PIZZAS ARE VEGETARIAN ! I hope this place continues to change people's perceptions of vegetarian pizzas being less flavorful, delicious or desirable because this pizza was definitely better than many of the meat-included pizzas I've had in my LIFETIME. Definitely worth the visit, prices are reasonable because you're in a college town, good quality, would 10/10 recommend."
258,"The green sauce!!! Sliver's green sauce is the main reason I want to eat here all the time.(For reference, I have never tried Cheese Board)Sliver changes their pizza toppings daily, so check their website before going in if you're a picky eater! My favorite pizzas are the ones topped with corn and mushrooms. Their pizzas are more like cheesy bread (think of a flatter version of the cheese bread at Sweet Tomatoes). They have a thin crust with a generous amount of cheese + a sparse sprinkle of toppings. Their sauce is the reason I keep coming back--it's tangy with a bit of heat. It's the perfect compliment to their cheesy pizza and would taste good on practically anything.For the price (a bit over $20 for a whole pizza or a few bucks for slice), I do wish that they'd be more generous with the toppings. Also, from a value perspective, not the most cost-efficient which is why I'm giving it 4-stars."
259,"I've been to Sliver Pizzeria over 5 times and I've never had a bad pizza.  Some pizzas are tastier than others though.  Check out Sliver's website to see the pizza of the day!  Sliver only sells one type of pizza each day and the pizza is always vegetarian!  Be sure to warn any meat lovers you may be taking to Sliver with you.  I didn't warn my Filipino meat-loving mom when I took her to Sliver and she was shocked that there weren't any meat pizzas available.  She said she was going to go to Top Dog nearby to get a hot dog to fill her need for meat. -__-  Anyway, when you eat the pizza at Sliver, be sure to put some of the free green sauce on it.  The pizza is not complete without the green sauce.  Also, if you plan to drink alcohol at Sliver, I do not recommend the sangria.  It just tasted like juice and there were no visible fruits in the drink...  It could've been better."
260,"Sliver, the place started by a few former Cheeseboard employees who said the hell with the collective and started serving alcohol, making it a great place to watch a game and have a drink. Won't be a stretch to say that they took a few things with them - mainly the concept of one type of vegetarian pizza daily and that amazing green sauce!The pizza is amazing. Yes, some days are better than others but this is subjective and depends on your pizza preferences. But what's better than an amazing pizza? Amazing pizza you can share with friends while drinking a cold one and watching the game. This is where the two concepts diverge. One is not better than the other, it just depends on what you prefer in the specific case. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Is it a bit overhyped? Sure, but it mostly delivers."
261,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE. It's so hard to chew that my jaw literally hurts so much I don't even want to eat anymore. It's like chewing on cardboard.I definitely DO NOT want to come back here and would rather eat some Dominos, Pizza Hut, pls anything else but this."
262,"I got Sliver delivered by Caviar. The whole pie was 24$ plus taxes $2 something and $4 something for service fee plus 2$ tip. So even though Delivery was free the total charge for whole pizza came out to 33$ for me. Not cheap at all. Probably won't get it delivered again. Today's pizza had potatoes, caramelized onions (according to the menu but I couldn't taste it at all), goat cheese, mozzarella and olive oil. The whole pie came with 2 slivers (1 extra slice) which was a nice touch. The pizza was good and cilantro sauce was yum. It's basically chutney (Indian sauce lol). Overall,Not the best pizza I've had by far but it was good. Definitely wasn't worth what I spent on it."
263,"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Since they've only got one kind of pizza a day the only decision you have to make is how much to order! Another positive to this method is that it's ready immediately - they've just got hot pizzas waiting to be plated.  Between my boyfriend and I, we split a half and I ended up taking home a slice.  Totally reasonable prices - the half was not much more than $12, and they were very generous.There were a lot of flies inside, but what can you expect for a sports bar?  This is a casual spot and clearly popular with all the cal students.  We ate in but will probably do take out next time because parking kind of sucks in the area.They've got an amazing cilantro sauce that goes on the pizza that I would recommend to anyone (even cilantro haters, like myself)!  Love that you don't have to ask for water cups, and there's foil and paper bags to wrap your leftovers in.  Will definitely be back!"
264,"TL;DR 1 AWESOME vegetarian pizza/dayWhat is Sliver:They serve 1 vegetarian pizza each day. Meat lovers: don't be afraid, it will be great, and it will satisfy you.PLUSES:+ location: DT Berkeley, next to BART station & Cal+ vegetarian!! + crust + toppings are awesome, their 1 flavor a day pizza has never disappointed+ check online to see what the toppings of the day are+ their long line can be intimidating, but goes by pretty fastDELTAS:- Not as good as Cheese....."
265,"Oh my god, the green sauce!!! That was the biggest game changer for this place. I first went here when I was visiting my boyfriend in Berkeley. I could eat pizza everyday and this was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas that I have tried. I'm so heartbroken that I don't live anywhere near here because this would for sure be my go to place. The way this place works is that they have one flavor that they serve a day and that's it. And while that may not seem appealing at first it's like a mini adventure to try something that you might not have ever thought of ordering before. Every time I walked by this place it seemed like it was completely packed and every table was taken so that already is a pretty good sign that you're in for something good.About half of a full pizza was about $12 and even sharing that with two people was more than enough especially with the extra slivers that you get on top.I went here on a Thursday so when I went the pizza of the day was the roasted Yukon gold potato pizza. When I first heard that they were gonna be putting potatoes on my pizza I was a little hesitant but after taking one bite I was completely sold. You 100% have to get the green sauce to go with your pizza. It  enhances the flavor so well and makes it 10x better. If you don't use it you're doing it wrong. Can't wait to try the other pizzas of the day when I go back to visit."
266,"I absolutely love this pizza place. I might be a bit sentimental, but I've spent a lot of time with some of my best friends at Slivers. They give you a sliver of pizza every time you order a slice, or two slivers if you order a whole pizza. The first time I had it, I didn't even realize I was eating a vegetarian pizza! Everyday they have a different pizza, and they only serve one type of pizza a day. Super unique, and very efficient. If you like a bit of kick to your pizza, try their green sauce next to the water. It goes so well with any of their pizzas. If you want to find me in Berkeley, Slivers is where I'll be."
267,"3.5 round up / We came here bc the line for Cheeseboard intimidated us. Today's special had corn!!!!! Corn on  pizza is the best. The cilantro green sauce was also good. The line was really short but the service for the bar was quite slow. They check IDs for each beer *_* I'm old af. Below average beer selection. Good place for college or high school dates, lol.I don't actually understand the hype of this place and would only recommend if you are craving pizza in the area."
268,"I came here during memorial day on a recommendation that this is one of the best pizza places in Berkeley. It seems like any other pizza joint styles places with a good beer selection, tv, and pizza. At this point you don't have a menu, you have one pizza. We ordered the half pizza and got 2 slices for free. It seem pretty awesome to get some extra pizza. I enjoyed the ambiance of the pizza place ; Sports bar.

I had to dip my pizza in that so it had some flavor! It could be just this day and the special they had. I see on the menu some of the other specials and it looks bomb. I would come back and try another pizza."
291,"One type of pizza everyday, $3.25 per slice plus you get a little extra sliver. Water dispenser. Delicious pesto sauce condiment. Great outdoor seating as well.Came here to grab a quick bite before a graduation ceremony and was glad to have a full belly."
292,"Sliver is a vegetarian pizza place that serves one type of tasty pizza a day. My favorite flavor so far is definitely the potato and corn, but the other types are also unique and delicious. Occasionally, there are also new unique combinations that feature ingredients like peaches or blue cheese (super interesting to try, you could always buy a slice to try and eat somewhere else closeby if you don't like it). I usually check online to see what flavors they're serving each day that week, since I definitely prefer some pizzas over others. Along with that, there's a green sauce that's a great addition to the the cheesy non-marinara pizzas. They also serve frescas now, which are refreshing and not overly sweet.It's probably important to note that this place is very similar to Cheeseboard, in pizza and concept. Though it's still a quick and affordable place (especially closer to campus) for some delicious pizza."
293,"Pizza here reminds me of their East Bay neighbors The Cheese Board, Arizmendi Bakery, and Nabolom Bakery. All of them are serving one type of vegetarian pizza daily and aiming to create a community around good food including pizza. Prices are more or less similar too.Like The Cheese Board and Nabolom, their green sauce is a must try. Spicy sauce fans forget red chili pepper flakes and grab a few containers of their sauce.What sets Sliver Pizzeria from the rest is the setting. It's a sports bar with a full bar inside, TVs with sports on, long community tables, happy hour specials, and live music Friday's and Saturday's. If you're not in the mood, you can always get it to go or sit outside.I personally prefer Nabolom and Arizmendi's crust, but the pizza here is still solid. Plus, you gotta love those extra baby slices with your pizza."
294,"Food 4/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Bang for your buck 4/5. A great place to catch the games and get some pizzas with high quality ingredients. Note this place only has vegetarian pizza and one flavor per day. Check on their website to see which flavor is showcased today! On any given day, Sliver can get pretty busy, and even busier on days when there is a game playing. However, the line usually moves pretty rapidly because pizzas are continuously being baked. But, you might have a hard time find seating. If it does happen don't worry, it it's a nice day out bring your pizza on the front lawn of UC Berkeley. The one thing that makes it special is they actually provide two slivers with your slice of whole pizza, and hence the name. A really good deal is actually getting a slice of pizza and a salad. All the flavors are really good with top notch ingredients but I usually avoid days where they have tomatoes as a topping, as it doesn't add much to the pizza. I usually go for days where the toppings either include potatoes, or mushrooms or corn (best days). My own trope is that their pizza can get pretty oily because of the cheese. However, the green sauce that you can scoop yourself is pretty amazing and helps tame the oils from the pizza. Overall, it's a solid place to get pizza. I only wished sometimes that they did a meat pizza but I guess you can't have it all. Tips - Its cheaper to get a full pizza for $20 and share it between friends! Pros - High quality ingredients and with only one flavor you don't have to decide which flavor you want! Cons - the pizza can get oily but the green sauce help mitigate that."
295,"Pizza is OK but kinda inconsistent.  We stayed at the restaurant for a couple of hours to watch a warrior game.  The first pizza was good while the second one too oily, had way too much cheese,  and was a little undercooked.   I do like the green sauce but do not like the fact that there is only one type of pizza per day.Happy hour is 3PM - 6PM, you get pizza slivers with your order of alcohol."
296,"Their pizza is very much worth the hype! Always vegetarian and made fresh daily, their changing daily menu makes it easy to go every day. Their website is updated with the menu schedule for the week, so make sure to check it before you go! Their crust itself is more of a flatbread style rather than a fluffy crust style, and is slightly greasier than I'd like, but not more than is expected of a typical pizza. Either way, their pairing of toppings is impeccable, and each one is a delight. My personal favorite is the corn pizza, which I like to drizzle some of their pesto and squeeze a hint of lime on. The only thing is the lines can get pretty crazy during peak times, but service is quick."
297,"My boyfriend took me here as a ""must-go"" staple in Berkeley and I didn't know what to expect! The pizza was SO good - albeit a bit oily, but it's pizza (what do you expect). I had no idea what I was eating (what toppings) because we went in, got 2 slices of pizza, was handed the pizza and then walked out to proceed with our Berkeley food tour. Apparently the pizza of the day was something with kalamata olives (which I thought were some sort of meat) but ALL THEIR PIZZAS ARE VEGETARIAN ! I hope this place continues to change people's perceptions of vegetarian pizzas being less flavorful, delicious or desirable because this pizza was definitely better than many of the meat-included pizzas I've had in my LIFETIME. Definitely worth the visit, prices are reasonable because you're in a college town, good quality, would 10/10 recommend."
298,"The green sauce!!! Sliver's green sauce is the main reason I want to eat here all the time.(For reference, I have never tried Cheese Board)Sliver changes their pizza toppings daily, so check their website before going in if you're a picky eater! My favorite pizzas are the ones topped with corn and mushrooms. Their pizzas are more like cheesy bread (think of a flatter version of the cheese bread at Sweet Tomatoes). They have a thin crust with a generous amount of cheese + a sparse sprinkle of toppings. Their sauce is the reason I keep coming back--it's tangy with a bit of heat. It's the perfect compliment to their cheesy pizza and would taste good on practically anything.For the price (a bit over $20 for a whole pizza or a few bucks for slice), I do wish that they'd be more generous with the toppings. Also, from a value perspective, not the most cost-efficient which is why I'm giving it 4-stars."
299,"I've been to Sliver Pizzeria over 5 times and I've never had a bad pizza.  Some pizzas are tastier than others though.  Check out Sliver's website to see the pizza of the day!  Sliver only sells one type of pizza each day and the pizza is always vegetarian!  Be sure to warn any meat lovers you may be taking to Sliver with you.  I didn't warn my Filipino meat-loving mom when I took her to Sliver and she was shocked that there weren't any meat pizzas available.  She said she was going to go to Top Dog nearby to get a hot dog to fill her need for meat. -__-  Anyway, when you eat the pizza at Sliver, be sure to put some of the free green sauce on it.  The pizza is not complete without the green sauce.  Also, if you plan to drink alcohol at Sliver, I do not recommend the sangria.  It just tasted like juice and there were no visible fruits in the drink...  It could've been better."
300,"Sliver, the place started by a few former Cheeseboard employees who said the hell with the collective and started serving alcohol, making it a great place to watch a game and have a drink. Won't be a stretch to say that they took a few things with them - mainly the concept of one type of vegetarian pizza daily and that amazing green sauce!The pizza is amazing. Yes, some days are better than others but this is subjective and depends on your pizza preferences. But what's better than an amazing pizza? Amazing pizza you can share with friends while drinking a cold one and watching the game. This is where the two concepts diverge. One is not better than the other, it just depends on what you prefer in the specific case. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Is it a bit overhyped? Sure, but it mostly delivers."
301,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE. It's so hard to chew that my jaw literally hurts so much I don't even want to eat anymore. It's like chewing on cardboard.I definitely DO NOT want to come back here and would rather eat some Dominos, Pizza Hut, pls anything else but this."
302,"I got Sliver delivered by Caviar. The whole pie was 24$ plus taxes $2 something and $4 something for service fee plus 2$ tip. So even though Delivery was free the total charge for whole pizza came out to 33$ for me. Not cheap at all. Probably won't get it delivered again. Today's pizza had potatoes, caramelized onions (according to the menu but I couldn't taste it at all), goat cheese, mozzarella and olive oil. The whole pie came with 2 slivers (1 extra slice) which was a nice touch. The pizza was good and cilantro sauce was yum. It's basically chutney (Indian sauce lol). Overall,Not the best pizza I've had by far but it was good. Definitely wasn't worth what I spent on it."
303,"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Since they've only got one kind of pizza a day the only decision you have to make is how much to order! Another positive to this method is that it's ready immediately - they've just got hot pizzas waiting to be plated.  Between my boyfriend and I, we split a half and I ended up taking home a slice.  Totally reasonable prices - the half was not much more than $12, and they were very generous.There were a lot of flies inside, but what can you expect for a sports bar?  This is a casual spot and clearly popular with all the cal students.  We ate in but will probably do take out next time because parking kind of sucks in the area.They've got an amazing cilantro sauce that goes on the pizza that I would recommend to anyone (even cilantro haters, like myself)!  Love that you don't have to ask for water cups, and there's foil and paper bags to wrap your leftovers in.  Will definitely be back!"
304,"TL;DR 1 AWESOME vegetarian pizza/dayWhat is Sliver:They serve 1 vegetarian pizza each day. Meat lovers: don't be afraid, it will be great, and it will satisfy you.PLUSES:+ location: DT Berkeley, next to BART station & Cal+ vegetarian!! + crust + toppings are awesome, their 1 flavor a day pizza has never disappointed+ check online to see what the toppings of the day are+ their long line can be intimidating, but goes by pretty fastDELTAS:- Not as good as Cheese....."
305,"Oh my god, the green sauce!!! That was the biggest game changer for this place. I first went here when I was visiting my boyfriend in Berkeley. I could eat pizza everyday and this was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas that I have tried. I'm so heartbroken that I don't live anywhere near here because this would for sure be my go to place. The way this place works is that they have one flavor that they serve a day and that's it. And while that may not seem appealing at first it's like a mini adventure to try something that you might not have ever thought of ordering before. Every time I walked by this place it seemed like it was completely packed and every table was taken so that already is a pretty good sign that you're in for something good.About half of a full pizza was about $12 and even sharing that with two people was more than enough especially with the extra slivers that you get on top.I went here on a Thursday so when I went the pizza of the day was the roasted Yukon gold potato pizza. When I first heard that they were gonna be putting potatoes on my pizza I was a little hesitant but after taking one bite I was completely sold. You 100% have to get the green sauce to go with your pizza. It  enhances the flavor so well and makes it 10x better. If you don't use it you're doing it wrong. Can't wait to try the other pizzas of the day when I go back to visit."
306,"I absolutely love this pizza place. I might be a bit sentimental, but I've spent a lot of time with some of my best friends at Slivers. They give you a sliver of pizza every time you order a slice, or two slivers if you order a whole pizza. The first time I had it, I didn't even realize I was eating a vegetarian pizza! Everyday they have a different pizza, and they only serve one type of pizza a day. Super unique, and very efficient. If you like a bit of kick to your pizza, try their green sauce next to the water. It goes so well with any of their pizzas. If you want to find me in Berkeley, Slivers is where I'll be."
307,"3.5 round up / We came here bc the line for Cheeseboard intimidated us. Today's special had corn!!!!! Corn on  pizza is the best. The cilantro green sauce was also good. The line was really short but the service for the bar was quite slow. They check IDs for each beer *_* I'm old af. Below average beer selection. Good place for college or high school dates, lol.I don't actually understand the hype of this place and would only recommend if you are craving pizza in the area."
308,"I came here during memorial day on a recommendation that this is one of the best pizza places in Berkeley. It seems like any other pizza joint styles places with a good beer selection, tv, and pizza. At this point you don't have a menu, you have one pizza. We ordered the half pizza and got 2 slices for free. It seem pretty awesome to get some extra pizza. I enjoyed the ambiance of the pizza place ; Sports bar. Parking is tricky here in the sense that its street parking if you're lucky or the paid parking lot across the street. I came here for lunch when it just opened so it wasn't crowded but given that this is a college town I can see how crowded this gets. I loved the pizza. However I do like my freedom of choice and not being told what to eat. Though this is like a omakase style pizza joint, I'd prefer creating my own pizza place. But if I'm back in Berkeley I would hit up Sliver again or Cheeseboard.GO BEARS!"
309,"I came here on a weekday in the late afternoon to grab a single slice before getting on the Bart. Sliver only offers one flavor of pizza each day and the flavor changes every single day. When I went, the flavor was ""crimini mushrooms, yellow onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, fresh herbs, infused rosemary & chanterelle mushroom olive oil"".The slice comes with a small ""sliver"" on top, which is a nice bonus. The pizza was really oily, so I had to grab some napkins to blot off the oil. The pizza was quite aromatic because of the mushroom olive oil that they used, along with the actual mushrooms on top. The pizza was tasty and flavorful, but I personally didn't find it to be extraordinary and worth the $3.25 (including tax)."

Though it's still a quick and affordable place (especially closer to campus) for some delicious pizza."
333,"Pizza here reminds me of their East Bay neighbors The Cheese Board, Arizmendi Bakery, and Nabolom Bakery. All of them are serving one type of vegetarian pizza daily and aiming to create a community around good food including pizza. Prices are more or less similar too.Like The Cheese Board and Nabolom, their green sauce is a must try. Spicy sauce fans forget red chili pepper flakes and grab a few containers of their sauce.What sets Sliver Pizzeria from the rest is the setting. It's a sports bar with a full bar inside, TVs with sports on, long community tables, happy hour specials, and live music Friday's and Saturday's. If you're not in the mood, you can always get it to go or sit outside.I personally prefer Nabolom and Arizmendi's crust, but the pizza here is still solid. Plus, you gotta love those extra baby slices with your pizza."
334,"Food 4/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Bang for your buck 4/5. A great place to catch the games and get some pizzas with high quality ingredients. Note this place only has vegetarian pizza and one flavor per day. Check on their website to see which flavor is showcased today! On any given day, Sliver can get pretty busy, and even busier on days when there is a game playing. However, the line usually moves pretty rapidly because pizzas are continuously being baked. But, you might have a hard time find seating. If it does happen don't worry, it it's a nice day out bring your pizza on the front lawn of UC Berkeley. The one thing that makes it special is they actually provide two slivers with your slice of whole pizza, and hence the name. A really good deal is actually getting a slice of pizza and a salad. All the flavors are really good with top notch ingredients but I usually avoid days where they have tomatoes as a topping, as it doesn't add much to the pizza. I usually go for days where the toppings either include potatoes, or mushrooms or corn (best days). My own trope is that their pizza can get pretty oily because of the cheese. However, the green sauce that you can scoop yourself is pretty amazing and helps tame the oils from the pizza. Overall, it's a solid place to get pizza. I only wished sometimes that they did a meat pizza but I guess you can't have it all. Tips - Its cheaper to get a full pizza for $20 and share it between friends! Pros - High quality ingredients and with only one flavor you don't have to decide which flavor you want! Cons - the pizza can get oily but the green sauce help mitigate that."
335,"Pizza is OK but kinda inconsistent.  We stayed at the restaurant for a couple of hours to watch a warrior game.  The first pizza was good while the second one too oily, had way too much cheese,  and was a little undercooked.   I do like the green sauce but do not like the fact that there is only one type of pizza per day.Happy hour is 3PM - 6PM, you get pizza slivers with your order of alcohol."
336,"Their pizza is very much worth the hype! Always vegetarian and made fresh daily, their changing daily menu makes it easy to go every day. Their website is updated with the menu schedule for the week, so make sure to check it before you go! Their crust itself is more of a flatbread style rather than a fluffy crust style, and is slightly greasier than I'd like, but not more than is expected of a typical pizza. Either way, their pairing of toppings is impeccable, and each one is a delight. My personal favorite is the corn pizza, which I like to drizzle some of their pesto and squeeze a hint of lime on. The only thing is the lines can get pretty crazy during peak times, but service is quick."
337,"My boyfriend took me here as a ""must-go"" staple in Berkeley and I didn't know what to expect! The pizza was SO good - albeit a bit oily, but it's pizza (what do you expect). I had no idea what I was eating (what toppings) because we went in, got 2 slices of pizza, was handed the pizza and then walked out to proceed with our Berkeley food tour. Apparently the pizza of the day was something with kalamata olives (which I thought were some sort of meat) but ALL THEIR PIZZAS ARE VEGETARIAN ! I hope this place continues to change people's perceptions of vegetarian pizzas being less flavorful, delicious or desirable because this pizza was definitely better than many of the meat-included pizzas I've had in my LIFETIME. Definitely worth the visit, prices are reasonable because you're in a college town, good quality, would 10/10 recommend."
338,"The green sauce!!! Sliver's green sauce is the main reason I want to eat here all the time.(For reference, I have never tried Cheese Board)Sliver changes their pizza toppings daily, so check their website before going in if you're a picky eater! My favorite pizzas are the ones topped with corn and mushrooms. Their pizzas are more like cheesy bread (think of a flatter version of the cheese bread at Sweet Tomatoes). They have a thin crust with a generous amount of cheese + a sparse sprinkle of toppings. Their sauce is the reason I keep coming back--it's tangy with a bit of heat. It's the perfect compliment to their cheesy pizza and would taste good on practically anything.For the price (a bit over $20 for a whole pizza or a few bucks for slice), I do wish that they'd be more generous with the toppings. Also, from a value perspective, not the most cost-efficient which is why I'm giving it 4-stars."
339,"I've been to Sliver Pizzeria over 5 times and I've never had a bad pizza.  Some pizzas are tastier than others though.  Check out Sliver's website to see the pizza of the day!  Sliver only sells one type of pizza each day and the pizza is always vegetarian!  Be sure to warn any meat lovers you may be taking to Sliver with you.  I didn't warn my Filipino meat-loving mom when I took her to Sliver and she was shocked that there weren't any meat pizzas available.  She said she was going to go to Top Dog nearby to get a hot dog to fill her need for meat. -__-  Anyway, when you eat the pizza at Sliver, be sure to put some of the free green sauce on it.  The pizza is not complete without the green sauce.  Also, if you plan to drink alcohol at Sliver, I do not recommend the sangria.  It just tasted like juice and there were no visible fruits in the drink...  It could've been better."
340,"Sliver, the place started by a few former Cheeseboard employees who said the hell with the collective and started serving alcohol, making it a great place to watch a game and have a drink. Won't be a stretch to say that they took a few things with them - mainly the concept of one type of vegetarian pizza daily and that amazing green sauce!The pizza is amazing. Yes, some days are better than others but this is subjective and depends on your pizza preferences. But what's better than an amazing pizza? Amazing pizza you can share with friends while drinking a cold one and watching the game. This is where the two concepts diverge. One is not better than the other, it just depends on what you prefer in the specific case. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Is it a bit overhyped? Sure, but it mostly delivers."
341,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE. It's so hard to chew that my jaw literally hurts so much I don't even want to eat anymore. It's like chewing on cardboard.I definitely DO NOT want to come back here and would rather eat some Dominos, Pizza Hut, pls anything else but this."
342,"I got Sliver delivered by Caviar. The whole pie was 24$ plus taxes $2 something and $4 something for service fee plus 2$ tip. So even though Delivery was free the total charge for whole pizza came out to 33$ for me. Not cheap at all. Probably won't get it delivered again. Today's pizza had potatoes, caramelized onions (according to the menu but I couldn't taste it at all), goat cheese, mozzarella and olive oil. The whole pie came with 2 slivers (1 extra slice) which was a nice touch. The pizza was good and cilantro sauce was yum. It's basically chutney (Indian sauce lol). Overall,Not the best pizza I've had by far but it was good. Definitely wasn't worth what I spent on it."
343,"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Since they've only got one kind of pizza a day the only decision you have to make is how much to order! Another positive to this method is that it's ready immediately - they've just got hot pizzas waiting to be plated.  Between my boyfriend and I, we split a half and I ended up taking home a slice.  Totally reasonable prices - the half was not much more than $12, and they were very generous.There were a lot of flies inside, but what can you expect for a sports bar?  This is a casual spot and clearly popular with all the cal students.  We ate in but will probably do take out next time because parking kind of sucks in the area.They've got an amazing cilantro sauce that goes on the pizza that I would recommend to anyone (even cilantro haters, like myself)!  Love that you don't have to ask for water cups, and there's foil and paper bags to wrap your leftovers in.  Will definitely be back!"
344,"TL;DR 1 AWESOME vegetarian pizza/dayWhat is Sliver:They serve 1 vegetarian pizza each day. Meat lovers: don't be afraid, it will be great, and it will satisfy you.PLUSES:+ location: DT Berkeley, next to BART station & Cal+ vegetarian!! + crust + toppings are awesome, their 1 flavor a day pizza has never disappointed+ check online to see what the toppings of the day are+ their long line can be intimidating, but goes by pretty fastDELTAS:- Not as good as Cheese....."
345,"Oh my god, the green sauce!!! That was the biggest game changer for this place. I first went here when I was visiting my boyfriend in Berkeley. I could eat pizza everyday and this was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas that I have tried. I'm so heartbroken that I don't live anywhere near here because this would for sure be my go to place. The way this place works is that they have one flavor that they serve a day and that's it. And while that may not seem appealing at first it's like a mini adventure to try something that you might not have ever thought of ordering before. Every time I walked by this place it seemed like it was completely packed and every table was taken so that already is a pretty good sign that you're in for something good.About half of a full pizza was about $12 and even sharing that with two people was more than enough especially with the extra slivers that you get on top.I went here on a Thursday so when I went the pizza of the day was the roasted Yukon gold potato pizza. When I first heard that they were gonna be putting potatoes on my pizza I was a little hesitant but after taking one bite I was completely sold. You 100% have to get the green sauce to go with your pizza. It  enhances the flavor so well and makes it 10x better. If you don't use it you're doing it wrong. Can't wait to try the other pizzas of the day when I go back to visit."
346,"I absolutely love this pizza place. I might be a bit sentimental, but I've spent a lot of time with some of my best friends at Slivers. They give you a sliver of pizza every time you order a slice, or two slivers if you order a whole pizza. The first time I had it, I didn't even realize I was eating a vegetarian pizza! Everyday they have a different pizza, and they only serve one type of pizza a day. Super unique, and very efficient. If you like a bit of kick to your pizza, try their green sauce next to the water. It goes so well with any of their pizzas. If you want to find me in Berkeley, Slivers is where I'll be."
347,"3.5 round up / We came here bc the line for Cheeseboard intimidated us. Today's special had corn!!!!! Corn on  pizza is the best. The cilantro green sauce was also good. The line was really short but the service for the bar was quite slow. They check IDs for each beer *_* I'm old af. Below average beer selection. Good place for college or high school dates, lol.I don't actually understand the hype of this place and would only recommend if you are craving pizza in the area."
348,"I came here during memorial day on a recommendation that this is one of the best pizza places in Berkeley. It seems like any other pizza joint styles places with a good beer selection, tv, and pizza. At this point you don't have a menu, you have one pizza. We ordered the half pizza and got 2 slices for free. It seem pretty awesome to get some extra pizza. I enjoyed the ambiance of the pizza place ; Sports bar. Parking is tricky here in the sense that its street parking if you're lucky or the paid parking lot across the street. I came here for lunch when it just opened so it wasn't crowded but given that this is a college town I can see how crowded this gets. I loved the pizza. However I do like my freedom of choice and not being told what to eat. Though this is like a omakase style pizza joint, I'd prefer creating my own pizza place. But if I'm back in Berkeley I would hit up Sliver again or Cheeseboard.GO BEARS!"
349,"I came here on a weekday in the late afternoon to grab a single slice before getting on the Bart. Sliver only offers one flavor of pizza each day and the flavor changes every single day. When I went, the flavor was ""crimini mushrooms, yellow onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, fresh herbs, infused rosemary & chanterelle mushroom olive oil"".The slice comes with a small ""sliver"" on top, which is a nice bonus. The pizza was really oily, so I had to grab some napkins to blot off the oil. The pizza was quite aromatic because of the mushroom olive oil that they used, along with the actual mushrooms on top. The pizza was tasty and flavorful, but I personally didn't find it to be extraordinary and worth the $3.25 (including tax)."
350,"I heard a lot of great things about this place! I went on a Saturday before the lunch rush. I order the special pizza for the day. It had pineapple, arugula, mozzarella and something else. I was surprised when the pizza was tough and hard to bite into. I didn't think it tasted that good. The good thing was the pesto sauce they have on the side. I had to dip my pizza in that so it had some flavor! It could be just this day and the special they had. I see on the menu some of the other specials and it looks bomb. I would come back and try another pizza."
351,"One type of pizza everyday, $3.25 per slice plus you get a little extra sliver. Water dispenser. Delicious pesto sauce condiment. Great outdoor seating as well.Came here to grab a quick bite before a graduation ceremony and was glad to have a full belly."
352,"Sliver is a vegetarian pizza place that serves one type of tasty pizza a day. My favorite flavor so far is definitely the potato and corn, but the other types are also unique and delicious. Occasionally, there are also new unique combinations that feature ingredients like peaches or blue cheese (super interesting to try, you could always buy a slice to try and eat somewhere else closeby if you don't like it). I usually check online to see what flavors they're serving each day that week, since I definitely prefer some pizzas over others. Along with that, there's a green sauce that's a great addition to the the cheesy non-marinara pizzas.

On any given day, Sliver can get pretty busy, and even busier on days when there is a game playing. However, the line usually moves pretty rapidly because pizzas are continuously being baked. But, you might have a hard time find seating. If it does happen don't worry, it it's a nice day out bring your pizza on the front lawn of UC Berkeley. The one thing that makes it special is they actually provide two slivers with your slice of whole pizza, and hence the name. A really good deal is actually getting a slice of pizza and a salad. All the flavors are really good with top notch ingredients but I usually avoid days where they have tomatoes as a topping, as it doesn't add much to the pizza. I usually go for days where the toppings either include potatoes, or mushrooms or corn (best days). My own trope is that their pizza can get pretty oily because of the cheese. However, the green sauce that you can scoop yourself is pretty amazing and helps tame the oils from the pizza. Overall, it's a solid place to get pizza. I only wished sometimes that they did a meat pizza but I guess you can't have it all. Tips - Its cheaper to get a full pizza for $20 and share it between friends! Pros - High quality ingredients and with only one flavor you don't have to decide which flavor you want! Cons - the pizza can get oily but the green sauce help mitigate that."
375,"Pizza is OK but kinda inconsistent.  We stayed at the restaurant for a couple of hours to watch a warrior game.  The first pizza was good while the second one too oily, had way too much cheese,  and was a little undercooked.   I do like the green sauce but do not like the fact that there is only one type of pizza per day.Happy hour is 3PM - 6PM, you get pizza slivers with your order of alcohol."
376,"Their pizza is very much worth the hype! Always vegetarian and made fresh daily, their changing daily menu makes it easy to go every day. Their website is updated with the menu schedule for the week, so make sure to check it before you go! Their crust itself is more of a flatbread style rather than a fluffy crust style, and is slightly greasier than I'd like, but not more than is expected of a typical pizza. Either way, their pairing of toppings is impeccable, and each one is a delight. My personal favorite is the corn pizza, which I like to drizzle some of their pesto and squeeze a hint of lime on. The only thing is the lines can get pretty crazy during peak times, but service is quick."
377,"My boyfriend took me here as a ""must-go"" staple in Berkeley and I didn't know what to expect! The pizza was SO good - albeit a bit oily, but it's pizza (what do you expect). I had no idea what I was eating (what toppings) because we went in, got 2 slices of pizza, was handed the pizza and then walked out to proceed with our Berkeley food tour. Apparently the pizza of the day was something with kalamata olives (which I thought were some sort of meat) but ALL THEIR PIZZAS ARE VEGETARIAN ! I hope this place continues to change people's perceptions of vegetarian pizzas being less flavorful, delicious or desirable because this pizza was definitely better than many of the meat-included pizzas I've had in my LIFETIME. Definitely worth the visit, prices are reasonable because you're in a college town, good quality, would 10/10 recommend."
378,"The green sauce!!! Sliver's green sauce is the main reason I want to eat here all the time.(For reference, I have never tried Cheese Board)Sliver changes their pizza toppings daily, so check their website before going in if you're a picky eater! My favorite pizzas are the ones topped with corn and mushrooms. Their pizzas are more like cheesy bread (think of a flatter version of the cheese bread at Sweet Tomatoes). They have a thin crust with a generous amount of cheese + a sparse sprinkle of toppings. Their sauce is the reason I keep coming back--it's tangy with a bit of heat. It's the perfect compliment to their cheesy pizza and would taste good on practically anything.For the price (a bit over $20 for a whole pizza or a few bucks for slice), I do wish that they'd be more generous with the toppings. Also, from a value perspective, not the most cost-efficient which is why I'm giving it 4-stars."
379,"I've been to Sliver Pizzeria over 5 times and I've never had a bad pizza.  Some pizzas are tastier than others though.  Check out Sliver's website to see the pizza of the day!  Sliver only sells one type of pizza each day and the pizza is always vegetarian!  Be sure to warn any meat lovers you may be taking to Sliver with you.  I didn't warn my Filipino meat-loving mom when I took her to Sliver and she was shocked that there weren't any meat pizzas available.  She said she was going to go to Top Dog nearby to get a hot dog to fill her need for meat. -__-  Anyway, when you eat the pizza at Sliver, be sure to put some of the free green sauce on it.  The pizza is not complete without the green sauce.  Also, if you plan to drink alcohol at Sliver, I do not recommend the sangria.  It just tasted like juice and there were no visible fruits in the drink...  It could've been better."
380,"Sliver, the place started by a few former Cheeseboard employees who said the hell with the collective and started serving alcohol, making it a great place to watch a game and have a drink. Won't be a stretch to say that they took a few things with them - mainly the concept of one type of vegetarian pizza daily and that amazing green sauce!The pizza is amazing. Yes, some days are better than others but this is subjective and depends on your pizza preferences. But what's better than an amazing pizza? Amazing pizza you can share with friends while drinking a cold one and watching the game. This is where the two concepts diverge. One is not better than the other, it just depends on what you prefer in the specific case. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Is it a bit overhyped? Sure, but it mostly delivers."
381,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE. It's so hard to chew that my jaw literally hurts so much I don't even want to eat anymore. It's like chewing on cardboard.I definitely DO NOT want to come back here and would rather eat some Dominos, Pizza Hut, pls anything else but this."
382,"I got Sliver delivered by Caviar. The whole pie was 24$ plus taxes $2 something and $4 something for service fee plus 2$ tip. So even though Delivery was free the total charge for whole pizza came out to 33$ for me. Not cheap at all. Probably won't get it delivered again. Today's pizza had potatoes, caramelized onions (according to the menu but I couldn't taste it at all), goat cheese, mozzarella and olive oil. The whole pie came with 2 slivers (1 extra slice) which was a nice touch. The pizza was good and cilantro sauce was yum. It's basically chutney (Indian sauce lol). Overall,Not the best pizza I've had by far but it was good. Definitely wasn't worth what I spent on it."
383,"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Since they've only got one kind of pizza a day the only decision you have to make is how much to order! Another positive to this method is that it's ready immediately - they've just got hot pizzas waiting to be plated.  Between my boyfriend and I, we split a half and I ended up taking home a slice.  Totally reasonable prices - the half was not much more than $12, and they were very generous.There were a lot of flies inside, but what can you expect for a sports bar?  This is a casual spot and clearly popular with all the cal students.  We ate in but will probably do take out next time because parking kind of sucks in the area.They've got an amazing cilantro sauce that goes on the pizza that I would recommend to anyone (even cilantro haters, like myself)!  Love that you don't have to ask for water cups, and there's foil and paper bags to wrap your leftovers in.  Will definitely be back!"
384,"TL;DR 1 AWESOME vegetarian pizza/dayWhat is Sliver:They serve 1 vegetarian pizza each day. Meat lovers: don't be afraid, it will be great, and it will satisfy you.PLUSES:+ location: DT Berkeley, next to BART station & Cal+ vegetarian!! + crust + toppings are awesome, their 1 flavor a day pizza has never disappointed+ check online to see what the toppings of the day are+ their long line can be intimidating, but goes by pretty fastDELTAS:- Not as good as Cheese....."
385,"Oh my god, the green sauce!!! That was the biggest game changer for this place. I first went here when I was visiting my boyfriend in Berkeley. I could eat pizza everyday and this was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas that I have tried. I'm so heartbroken that I don't live anywhere near here because this would for sure be my go to place. The way this place works is that they have one flavor that they serve a day and that's it. And while that may not seem appealing at first it's like a mini adventure to try something that you might not have ever thought of ordering before. Every time I walked by this place it seemed like it was completely packed and every table was taken so that already is a pretty good sign that you're in for something good.About half of a full pizza was about $12 and even sharing that with two people was more than enough especially with the extra slivers that you get on top.I went here on a Thursday so when I went the pizza of the day was the roasted Yukon gold potato pizza. When I first heard that they were gonna be putting potatoes on my pizza I was a little hesitant but after taking one bite I was completely sold. You 100% have to get the green sauce to go with your pizza. It  enhances the flavor so well and makes it 10x better. If you don't use it you're doing it wrong. Can't wait to try the other pizzas of the day when I go back to visit."
386,"I absolutely love this pizza place. I might be a bit sentimental, but I've spent a lot of time with some of my best friends at Slivers. They give you a sliver of pizza every time you order a slice, or two slivers if you order a whole pizza. The first time I had it, I didn't even realize I was eating a vegetarian pizza! Everyday they have a different pizza, and they only serve one type of pizza a day. Super unique, and very efficient. If you like a bit of kick to your pizza, try their green sauce next to the water. It goes so well with any of their pizzas. If you want to find me in Berkeley, Slivers is where I'll be."
387,"3.5 round up / We came here bc the line for Cheeseboard intimidated us. Today's special had corn!!!!! Corn on  pizza is the best. The cilantro green sauce was also good. The line was really short but the service for the bar was quite slow. They check IDs for each beer *_* I'm old af. Below average beer selection. Good place for college or high school dates, lol.I don't actually understand the hype of this place and would only recommend if you are craving pizza in the area."
388,"I came here during memorial day on a recommendation that this is one of the best pizza places in Berkeley. It seems like any other pizza joint styles places with a good beer selection, tv, and pizza. At this point you don't have a menu, you have one pizza. We ordered the half pizza and got 2 slices for free. It seem pretty awesome to get some extra pizza. I enjoyed the ambiance of the pizza place ; Sports bar. Parking is tricky here in the sense that its street parking if you're lucky or the paid parking lot across the street. I came here for lunch when it just opened so it wasn't crowded but given that this is a college town I can see how crowded this gets. I loved the pizza. However I do like my freedom of choice and not being told what to eat. Though this is like a omakase style pizza joint, I'd prefer creating my own pizza place. But if I'm back in Berkeley I would hit up Sliver again or Cheeseboard.GO BEARS!"
389,"I came here on a weekday in the late afternoon to grab a single slice before getting on the Bart. Sliver only offers one flavor of pizza each day and the flavor changes every single day. When I went, the flavor was ""crimini mushrooms, yellow onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, fresh herbs, infused rosemary & chanterelle mushroom olive oil"".The slice comes with a small ""sliver"" on top, which is a nice bonus. The pizza was really oily, so I had to grab some napkins to blot off the oil. The pizza was quite aromatic because of the mushroom olive oil that they used, along with the actual mushrooms on top. The pizza was tasty and flavorful, but I personally didn't find it to be extraordinary and worth the $3.25 (including tax)."
390,"I heard a lot of great things about this place! I went on a Saturday before the lunch rush. I order the special pizza for the day. It had pineapple, arugula, mozzarella and something else. I was surprised when the pizza was tough and hard to bite into. I didn't think it tasted that good. The good thing was the pesto sauce they have on the side. I had to dip my pizza in that so it had some flavor! It could be just this day and the special they had. I see on the menu some of the other specials and it looks bomb. I would come back and try another pizza."
391,"One type of pizza everyday, $3.25 per slice plus you get a little extra sliver. Water dispenser. Delicious pesto sauce condiment. Great outdoor seating as well.Came here to grab a quick bite before a graduation ceremony and was glad to have a full belly."
392,"Sliver is a vegetarian pizza place that serves one type of tasty pizza a day. My favorite flavor so far is definitely the potato and corn, but the other types are also unique and delicious. Occasionally, there are also new unique combinations that feature ingredients like peaches or blue cheese (super interesting to try, you could always buy a slice to try and eat somewhere else closeby if you don't like it). I usually check online to see what flavors they're serving each day that week, since I definitely prefer some pizzas over others. Along with that, there's a green sauce that's a great addition to the the cheesy non-marinara pizzas. They also serve frescas now, which are refreshing and not overly sweet.It's probably important to note that this place is very similar to Cheeseboard, in pizza and concept. Though it's still a quick and affordable place (especially closer to campus) for some delicious pizza."
393,"Pizza here reminds me of their East Bay neighbors The Cheese Board, Arizmendi Bakery, and Nabolom Bakery. All of them are serving one type of vegetarian pizza daily and aiming to create a community around good food including pizza. Prices are more or less similar too.Like The Cheese Board and Nabolom, their green sauce is a must try. Spicy sauce fans forget red chili pepper flakes and grab a few containers of their sauce.What sets Sliver Pizzeria from the rest is the setting. It's a sports bar with a full bar inside, TVs with sports on, long community tables, happy hour specials, and live music Friday's and Saturday's. If you're not in the mood, you can always get it to go or sit outside.I personally prefer Nabolom and Arizmendi's crust, but the pizza here is still solid. Plus, you gotta love those extra baby slices with your pizza."

415,"Pizza is OK but kinda inconsistent.  We stayed at the restaurant for a couple of hours to watch a warrior game.  The first pizza was good while the second one too oily, had way too much cheese,  and was a little undercooked.   I do like the green sauce but do not like the fact that there is only one type of pizza per day.Happy hour is 3PM - 6PM, you get pizza slivers with your order of alcohol."
416,"Their pizza is very much worth the hype! Always vegetarian and made fresh daily, their changing daily menu makes it easy to go every day. Their website is updated with the menu schedule for the week, so make sure to check it before you go! Their crust itself is more of a flatbread style rather than a fluffy crust style, and is slightly greasier than I'd like, but not more than is expected of a typical pizza. Either way, their pairing of toppings is impeccable, and each one is a delight. My personal favorite is the corn pizza, which I like to drizzle some of their pesto and squeeze a hint of lime on. The only thing is the lines can get pretty crazy during peak times, but service is quick."
417,"My boyfriend took me here as a ""must-go"" staple in Berkeley and I didn't know what to expect! The pizza was SO good - albeit a bit oily, but it's pizza (what do you expect). I had no idea what I was eating (what toppings) because we went in, got 2 slices of pizza, was handed the pizza and then walked out to proceed with our Berkeley food tour. Apparently the pizza of the day was something with kalamata olives (which I thought were some sort of meat) but ALL THEIR PIZZAS ARE VEGETARIAN ! I hope this place continues to change people's perceptions of vegetarian pizzas being less flavorful, delicious or desirable because this pizza was definitely better than many of the meat-included pizzas I've had in my LIFETIME. Definitely worth the visit, prices are reasonable because you're in a college town, good quality, would 10/10 recommend."
418,"The green sauce!!! Sliver's green sauce is the main reason I want to eat here all the time.(For reference, I have never tried Cheese Board)Sliver changes their pizza toppings daily, so check their website before going in if you're a picky eater! My favorite pizzas are the ones topped with corn and mushrooms. Their pizzas are more like cheesy bread (think of a flatter version of the cheese bread at Sweet Tomatoes). They have a thin crust with a generous amount of cheese + a sparse sprinkle of toppings. Their sauce is the reason I keep coming back--it's tangy with a bit of heat. It's the perfect compliment to their cheesy pizza and would taste good on practically anything.For the price (a bit over $20 for a whole pizza or a few bucks for slice), I do wish that they'd be more generous with the toppings. Also, from a value perspective, not the most cost-efficient which is why I'm giving it 4-stars."
419,"I've been to Sliver Pizzeria over 5 times and I've never had a bad pizza.  Some pizzas are tastier than others though.  Check out Sliver's website to see the pizza of the day!  Sliver only sells one type of pizza each day and the pizza is always vegetarian!  Be sure to warn any meat lovers you may be taking to Sliver with you.  I didn't warn my Filipino meat-loving mom when I took her to Sliver and she was shocked that there weren't any meat pizzas available.  She said she was going to go to Top Dog nearby to get a hot dog to fill her need for meat. -__-  Anyway, when you eat the pizza at Sliver, be sure to put some of the free green sauce on it.  The pizza is not complete without the green sauce.  Also, if you plan to drink alcohol at Sliver, I do not recommend the sangria.  It just tasted like juice and there were no visible fruits in the drink...  It could've been better."
420,"Sliver, the place started by a few former Cheeseboard employees who said the hell with the collective and started serving alcohol, making it a great place to watch a game and have a drink. Won't be a stretch to say that they took a few things with them - mainly the concept of one type of vegetarian pizza daily and that amazing green sauce!The pizza is amazing. Yes, some days are better than others but this is subjective and depends on your pizza preferences. But what's better than an amazing pizza? Amazing pizza you can share with friends while drinking a cold one and watching the game. This is where the two concepts diverge. One is not better than the other, it just depends on what you prefer in the specific case. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Is it a bit overhyped? Sure, but it mostly delivers."
421,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE. It's so hard to chew that my jaw literally hurts so much I don't even want to eat anymore. It's like chewing on cardboard.I definitely DO NOT want to come back here and would rather eat some Dominos, Pizza Hut, pls anything else but this."
422,"I got Sliver delivered by Caviar. The whole pie was 24$ plus taxes $2 something and $4 something for service fee plus 2$ tip. So even though Delivery was free the total charge for whole pizza came out to 33$ for me. Not cheap at all. Probably won't get it delivered again. Today's pizza had potatoes, caramelized onions (according to the menu but I couldn't taste it at all), goat cheese, mozzarella and olive oil. The whole pie came with 2 slivers (1 extra slice) which was a nice touch. The pizza was good and cilantro sauce was yum. It's basically chutney (Indian sauce lol). Overall,Not the best pizza I've had by far but it was good. Definitely wasn't worth what I spent on it."
423,"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Since they've only got one kind of pizza a day the only decision you have to make is how much to order! Another positive to this method is that it's ready immediately - they've just got hot pizzas waiting to be plated.  Between my boyfriend and I, we split a half and I ended up taking home a slice.  Totally reasonable prices - the half was not much more than $12, and they were very generous.There were a lot of flies inside, but what can you expect for a sports bar?  This is a casual spot and clearly popular with all the cal students.  We ate in but will probably do take out next time because parking kind of sucks in the area.They've got an amazing cilantro sauce that goes on the pizza that I would recommend to anyone (even cilantro haters, like myself)!  Love that you don't have to ask for water cups, and there's foil and paper bags to wrap your leftovers in.  Will definitely be back!"
424,"TL;DR 1 AWESOME vegetarian pizza/dayWhat is Sliver:They serve 1 vegetarian pizza each day. Meat lovers: don't be afraid, it will be great, and it will satisfy you.PLUSES:+ location: DT Berkeley, next to BART station & Cal+ vegetarian!! + crust + toppings are awesome, their 1 flavor a day pizza has never disappointed+ check online to see what the toppings of the day are+ their long line can be intimidating, but goes by pretty fastDELTAS:- Not as good as Cheese....."
425,"Oh my god, the green sauce!!! That was the biggest game changer for this place. I first went here when I was visiting my boyfriend in Berkeley. I could eat pizza everyday and this was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas that I have tried. I'm so heartbroken that I don't live anywhere near here because this would for sure be my go to place. The way this place works is that they have one flavor that they serve a day and that's it. And while that may not seem appealing at first it's like a mini adventure to try something that you might not have ever thought of ordering before. Every time I walked by this place it seemed like it was completely packed and every table was taken so that already is a pretty good sign that you're in for something good.About half of a full pizza was about $12 and even sharing that with two people was more than enough especially with the extra slivers that you get on top.I went here on a Thursday so when I went the pizza of the day was the roasted Yukon gold potato pizza. When I first heard that they were gonna be putting potatoes on my pizza I was a little hesitant but after taking one bite I was completely sold. You 100% have to get the green sauce to go with your pizza. It  enhances the flavor so well and makes it 10x better. If you don't use it you're doing it wrong. Can't wait to try the other pizzas of the day when I go back to visit."
426,"I absolutely love this pizza place. I might be a bit sentimental, but I've spent a lot of time with some of my best friends at Slivers. They give you a sliver of pizza every time you order a slice, or two slivers if you order a whole pizza. The first time I had it, I didn't even realize I was eating a vegetarian pizza! Everyday they have a different pizza, and they only serve one type of pizza a day. Super unique, and very efficient. If you like a bit of kick to your pizza, try their green sauce next to the water. It goes so well with any of their pizzas. If you want to find me in Berkeley, Slivers is where I'll be."
427,"3.5 round up / We came here bc the line for Cheeseboard intimidated us. Today's special had corn!!!!! Corn on  pizza is the best. The cilantro green sauce was also good. The line was really short but the service for the bar was quite slow. They check IDs for each beer *_* I'm old af. Below average beer selection. Good place for college or high school dates, lol.I don't actually understand the hype of this place and would only recommend if you are craving pizza in the area."
428,"I came here during memorial day on a recommendation that this is one of the best pizza places in Berkeley. It seems like any other pizza joint styles places with a good beer selection, tv, and pizza. At this point you don't have a menu, you have one pizza. We ordered the half pizza and got 2 slices for free. It seem pretty awesome to get some extra pizza. I enjoyed the ambiance of the pizza place ; Sports bar. Parking is tricky here in the sense that its street parking if you're lucky or the paid parking lot across the street. I came here for lunch when it just opened so it wasn't crowded but given that this is a college town I can see how crowded this gets. I loved the pizza. However I do like my freedom of choice and not being told what to eat. Though this is like a omakase style pizza joint, I'd prefer creating my own pizza place. But if I'm back in Berkeley I would hit up Sliver again or Cheeseboard.GO BEARS!"
429,"I came here on a weekday in the late afternoon to grab a single slice before getting on the Bart. Sliver only offers one flavor of pizza each day and the flavor changes every single day. When I went, the flavor was ""crimini mushrooms, yellow onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, fresh herbs, infused rosemary & chanterelle mushroom olive oil"".The slice comes with a small ""sliver"" on top, which is a nice bonus. The pizza was really oily, so I had to grab some napkins to blot off the oil. The pizza was quite aromatic because of the mushroom olive oil that they used, along with the actual mushrooms on top. The pizza was tasty and flavorful, but I personally didn't find it to be extraordinary and worth the $3.25 (including tax)."
430,"I heard a lot of great things about this place! I went on a Saturday before the lunch rush. I order the special pizza for the day. It had pineapple, arugula, mozzarella and something else. I was surprised when the pizza was tough and hard to bite into. I didn't think it tasted that good. The good thing was the pesto sauce they have on the side. I had to dip my pizza in that so it had some flavor! It could be just this day and the special they had. I see on the menu some of the other specials and it looks bomb. I would come back and try another pizza."
431,"One type of pizza everyday, $3.25 per slice plus you get a little extra sliver. Water dispenser. Delicious pesto sauce condiment. Great outdoor seating as well.Came here to grab a quick bite before a graduation ceremony and was glad to have a full belly."
432,"Sliver is a vegetarian pizza place that serves one type of tasty pizza a day. My favorite flavor so far is definitely the potato and corn, but the other types are also unique and delicious. Occasionally, there are also new unique combinations that feature ingredients like peaches or blue cheese (super interesting to try, you could always buy a slice to try and eat somewhere else closeby if you don't like it). I usually check online to see what flavors they're serving each day that week, since I definitely prefer some pizzas over others. Along with that, there's a green sauce that's a great addition to the the cheesy non-marinara pizzas. They also serve frescas now, which are refreshing and not overly sweet.It's probably important to note that this place is very similar to Cheeseboard, in pizza and concept. Though it's still a quick and affordable place (especially closer to campus) for some delicious pizza."
433,"Pizza here reminds me of their East Bay neighbors The Cheese Board, Arizmendi Bakery, and Nabolom Bakery. All of them are serving one type of vegetarian pizza daily and aiming to create a community around good food including pizza. Prices are more or less similar too.Like The Cheese Board and Nabolom, their green sauce is a must try. Spicy sauce fans forget red chili pepper flakes and grab a few containers of their sauce.What sets Sliver Pizzeria from the rest is the setting. It's a sports bar with a full bar inside, TVs with sports on, long community tables, happy hour specials, and live music Friday's and Saturday's. If you're not in the mood, you can always get it to go or sit outside.I personally prefer Nabolom and Arizmendi's crust, but the pizza here is still solid. Plus, you gotta love those extra baby slices with your pizza."
434,"Food 4/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Bang for your buck 4/5. A great place to catch the games and get some pizzas with high quality ingredients. Note this place only has vegetarian pizza and one flavor per day. Check on their website to see which flavor is showcased today! On any given day, Sliver can get pretty busy, and even busier on days when there is a game playing. However, the line usually moves pretty rapidly because pizzas are continuously being baked. But, you might have a hard time find seating. If it does happen don't worry, it it's a nice day out bring your pizza on the front lawn of UC Berkeley. The one thing that makes it special is they actually provide two slivers with your slice of whole pizza, and hence the name. A really good deal is actually getting a slice of pizza and a salad. All the flavors are really good with top notch ingredients but I usually avoid days where they have tomatoes as a topping, as it doesn't add much to the pizza. I usually go for days where the toppings either include potatoes, or mushrooms or corn (best days). My own trope is that their pizza can get pretty oily because of the cheese. However, the green sauce that you can scoop yourself is pretty amazing and helps tame the oils from the pizza. Overall, it's a solid place to get pizza. I only wished sometimes that they did a meat pizza but I guess you can't have it all. Tips - Its cheaper to get a full pizza for $20 and share it between friends!

457,"My boyfriend took me here as a ""must-go"" staple in Berkeley and I didn't know what to expect! The pizza was SO good - albeit a bit oily, but it's pizza (what do you expect). I had no idea what I was eating (what toppings) because we went in, got 2 slices of pizza, was handed the pizza and then walked out to proceed with our Berkeley food tour. Apparently the pizza of the day was something with kalamata olives (which I thought were some sort of meat) but ALL THEIR PIZZAS ARE VEGETARIAN ! I hope this place continues to change people's perceptions of vegetarian pizzas being less flavorful, delicious or desirable because this pizza was definitely better than many of the meat-included pizzas I've had in my LIFETIME. Definitely worth the visit, prices are reasonable because you're in a college town, good quality, would 10/10 recommend."
458,"The green sauce!!! Sliver's green sauce is the main reason I want to eat here all the time.(For reference, I have never tried Cheese Board)Sliver changes their pizza toppings daily, so check their website before going in if you're a picky eater! My favorite pizzas are the ones topped with corn and mushrooms. Their pizzas are more like cheesy bread (think of a flatter version of the cheese bread at Sweet Tomatoes). They have a thin crust with a generous amount of cheese + a sparse sprinkle of toppings. Their sauce is the reason I keep coming back--it's tangy with a bit of heat. It's the perfect compliment to their cheesy pizza and would taste good on practically anything.For the price (a bit over $20 for a whole pizza or a few bucks for slice), I do wish that they'd be more generous with the toppings. Also, from a value perspective, not the most cost-efficient which is why I'm giving it 4-stars."
459,"I've been to Sliver Pizzeria over 5 times and I've never had a bad pizza.  Some pizzas are tastier than others though.  Check out Sliver's website to see the pizza of the day!  Sliver only sells one type of pizza each day and the pizza is always vegetarian!  Be sure to warn any meat lovers you may be taking to Sliver with you.  I didn't warn my Filipino meat-loving mom when I took her to Sliver and she was shocked that there weren't any meat pizzas available.  She said she was going to go to Top Dog nearby to get a hot dog to fill her need for meat. -__-  Anyway, when you eat the pizza at Sliver, be sure to put some of the free green sauce on it.  The pizza is not complete without the green sauce.  Also, if you plan to drink alcohol at Sliver, I do not recommend the sangria.  It just tasted like juice and there were no visible fruits in the drink...  It could've been better."
460,"Sliver, the place started by a few former Cheeseboard employees who said the hell with the collective and started serving alcohol, making it a great place to watch a game and have a drink. Won't be a stretch to say that they took a few things with them - mainly the concept of one type of vegetarian pizza daily and that amazing green sauce!The pizza is amazing. Yes, some days are better than others but this is subjective and depends on your pizza preferences. But what's better than an amazing pizza? Amazing pizza you can share with friends while drinking a cold one and watching the game. This is where the two concepts diverge. One is not better than the other, it just depends on what you prefer in the specific case. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Is it a bit overhyped? Sure, but it mostly delivers."
461,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE. It's so hard to chew that my jaw literally hurts so much I don't even want to eat anymore. It's like chewing on cardboard.I definitely DO NOT want to come back here and would rather eat some Dominos, Pizza Hut, pls anything else but this."
462,"I got Sliver delivered by Caviar. The whole pie was 24$ plus taxes $2 something and $4 something for service fee plus 2$ tip. So even though Delivery was free the total charge for whole pizza came out to 33$ for me. Not cheap at all. Probably won't get it delivered again. Today's pizza had potatoes, caramelized onions (according to the menu but I couldn't taste it at all), goat cheese, mozzarella and olive oil. The whole pie came with 2 slivers (1 extra slice) which was a nice touch. The pizza was good and cilantro sauce was yum. It's basically chutney (Indian sauce lol). Overall,Not the best pizza I've had by far but it was good. Definitely wasn't worth what I spent on it."
463,"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Since they've only got one kind of pizza a day the only decision you have to make is how much to order! Another positive to this method is that it's ready immediately - they've just got hot pizzas waiting to be plated.  Between my boyfriend and I, we split a half and I ended up taking home a slice.  Totally reasonable prices - the half was not much more than $12, and they were very generous.There were a lot of flies inside, but what can you expect for a sports bar?  This is a casual spot and clearly popular with all the cal students.  We ate in but will probably do take out next time because parking kind of sucks in the area.They've got an amazing cilantro sauce that goes on the pizza that I would recommend to anyone (even cilantro haters, like myself)!  Love that you don't have to ask for water cups, and there's foil and paper bags to wrap your leftovers in.  Will definitely be back!"
464,"TL;DR 1 AWESOME vegetarian pizza/dayWhat is Sliver:They serve 1 vegetarian pizza each day. Meat lovers: don't be afraid, it will be great, and it will satisfy you.PLUSES:+ location: DT Berkeley, next to BART station & Cal+ vegetarian!! + crust + toppings are awesome, their 1 flavor a day pizza has never disappointed+ check online to see what the toppings of the day are+ their long line can be intimidating, but goes by pretty fastDELTAS:- Not as good as Cheese....."
465,"Oh my god, the green sauce!!! That was the biggest game changer for this place. I first went here when I was visiting my boyfriend in Berkeley. I could eat pizza everyday and this was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas that I have tried. I'm so heartbroken that I don't live anywhere near here because this would for sure be my go to place. The way this place works is that they have one flavor that they serve a day and that's it. And while that may not seem appealing at first it's like a mini adventure to try something that you might not have ever thought of ordering before. Every time I walked by this place it seemed like it was completely packed and every table was taken so that already is a pretty good sign that you're in for something good.About half of a full pizza was about $12 and even sharing that with two people was more than enough especially with the extra slivers that you get on top.I went here on a Thursday so when I went the pizza of the day was the roasted Yukon gold potato pizza. When I first heard that they were gonna be putting potatoes on my pizza I was a little hesitant but after taking one bite I was completely sold. You 100% have to get the green sauce to go with your pizza. It  enhances the flavor so well and makes it 10x better. If you don't use it you're doing it wrong. Can't wait to try the other pizzas of the day when I go back to visit."
466,"I absolutely love this pizza place. I might be a bit sentimental, but I've spent a lot of time with some of my best friends at Slivers. They give you a sliver of pizza every time you order a slice, or two slivers if you order a whole pizza. The first time I had it, I didn't even realize I was eating a vegetarian pizza! Everyday they have a different pizza, and they only serve one type of pizza a day. Super unique, and very efficient. If you like a bit of kick to your pizza, try their green sauce next to the water. It goes so well with any of their pizzas. If you want to find me in Berkeley, Slivers is where I'll be."
467,"3.5 round up / We came here bc the line for Cheeseboard intimidated us. Today's special had corn!!!!! Corn on  pizza is the best. The cilantro green sauce was also good. The line was really short but the service for the bar was quite slow. They check IDs for each beer *_* I'm old af. Below average beer selection. Good place for college or high school dates, lol.I don't actually understand the hype of this place and would only recommend if you are craving pizza in the area."
468,"I came here during memorial day on a recommendation that this is one of the best pizza places in Berkeley. It seems like any other pizza joint styles places with a good beer selection, tv, and pizza. At this point you don't have a menu, you have one pizza. We ordered the half pizza and got 2 slices for free. It seem pretty awesome to get some extra pizza. I enjoyed the ambiance of the pizza place ; Sports bar. Parking is tricky here in the sense that its street parking if you're lucky or the paid parking lot across the street. I came here for lunch when it just opened so it wasn't crowded but given that this is a college town I can see how crowded this gets. I loved the pizza. However I do like my freedom of choice and not being told what to eat. Though this is like a omakase style pizza joint, I'd prefer creating my own pizza place. But if I'm back in Berkeley I would hit up Sliver again or Cheeseboard.GO BEARS!"
469,"I came here on a weekday in the late afternoon to grab a single slice before getting on the Bart. Sliver only offers one flavor of pizza each day and the flavor changes every single day. When I went, the flavor was ""crimini mushrooms, yellow onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, fresh herbs, infused rosemary & chanterelle mushroom olive oil"".The slice comes with a small ""sliver"" on top, which is a nice bonus. The pizza was really oily, so I had to grab some napkins to blot off the oil. The pizza was quite aromatic because of the mushroom olive oil that they used, along with the actual mushrooms on top. The pizza was tasty and flavorful, but I personally didn't find it to be extraordinary and worth the $3.25 (including tax)."
470,"I heard a lot of great things about this place! I went on a Saturday before the lunch rush. I order the special pizza for the day. It had pineapple, arugula, mozzarella and something else. I was surprised when the pizza was tough and hard to bite into. I didn't think it tasted that good. The good thing was the pesto sauce they have on the side. I had to dip my pizza in that so it had some flavor! It could be just this day and the special they had. I see on the menu some of the other specials and it looks bomb. I would come back and try another pizza."
471,"One type of pizza everyday, $3.25 per slice plus you get a little extra sliver. Water dispenser. Delicious pesto sauce condiment. Great outdoor seating as well.Came here to grab a quick bite before a graduation ceremony and was glad to have a full belly."
472,"Sliver is a vegetarian pizza place that serves one type of tasty pizza a day. My favorite flavor so far is definitely the potato and corn, but the other types are also unique and delicious. Occasionally, there are also new unique combinations that feature ingredients like peaches or blue cheese (super interesting to try, you could always buy a slice to try and eat somewhere else closeby if you don't like it). I usually check online to see what flavors they're serving each day that week, since I definitely prefer some pizzas over others. Along with that, there's a green sauce that's a great addition to the the cheesy non-marinara pizzas. They also serve frescas now, which are refreshing and not overly sweet.It's probably important to note that this place is very similar to Cheeseboard, in pizza and concept. Though it's still a quick and affordable place (especially closer to campus) for some delicious pizza."
473,"Pizza here reminds me of their East Bay neighbors The Cheese Board, Arizmendi Bakery, and Nabolom Bakery. All of them are serving one type of vegetarian pizza daily and aiming to create a community around good food including pizza. Prices are more or less similar too.Like The Cheese Board and Nabolom, their green sauce is a must try. Spicy sauce fans forget red chili pepper flakes and grab a few containers of their sauce.What sets Sliver Pizzeria from the rest is the setting. It's a sports bar with a full bar inside, TVs with sports on, long community tables, happy hour specials, and live music Friday's and Saturday's. If you're not in the mood, you can always get it to go or sit outside.I personally prefer Nabolom and Arizmendi's crust, but the pizza here is still solid. Plus, you gotta love those extra baby slices with your pizza."
474,"Food 4/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Bang for your buck 4/5. A great place to catch the games and get some pizzas with high quality ingredients. Note this place only has vegetarian pizza and one flavor per day. Check on their website to see which flavor is showcased today! On any given day, Sliver can get pretty busy, and even busier on days when there is a game playing. However, the line usually moves pretty rapidly because pizzas are continuously being baked. But, you might have a hard time find seating. If it does happen don't worry, it it's a nice day out bring your pizza on the front lawn of UC Berkeley. The one thing that makes it special is they actually provide two slivers with your slice of whole pizza, and hence the name. A really good deal is actually getting a slice of pizza and a salad. All the flavors are really good with top notch ingredients but I usually avoid days where they have tomatoes as a topping, as it doesn't add much to the pizza. I usually go for days where the toppings either include potatoes, or mushrooms or corn (best days). My own trope is that their pizza can get pretty oily because of the cheese. However, the green sauce that you can scoop yourself is pretty amazing and helps tame the oils from the pizza. Overall, it's a solid place to get pizza. I only wished sometimes that they did a meat pizza but I guess you can't have it all. Tips - Its cheaper to get a full pizza for $20 and share it between friends! Pros - High quality ingredients and with only one flavor you don't have to decide which flavor you want! Cons - the pizza can get oily but the green sauce help mitigate that."
475,"Pizza is OK but kinda inconsistent.  We stayed at the restaurant for a couple of hours to watch a warrior game.  The first pizza was good while the second one too oily, had way too much cheese,  and was a little undercooked.   I do like the green sauce but do not like the fact that there is only one type of pizza per day.Happy hour is 3PM - 6PM, you get pizza slivers with your order of alcohol."
476,"Their pizza is very much worth the hype! Always vegetarian and made fresh daily, their changing daily menu makes it easy to go every day. Their website is updated with the menu schedule for the week, so make sure to check it before you go! Their crust itself is more of a flatbread style rather than a fluffy crust style, and is slightly greasier than I'd like, but not more than is expected of a typical pizza. Either way, their pairing of toppings is impeccable, and each one is a delight. My personal favorite is the corn pizza, which I like to drizzle some of their pesto and squeeze a hint of lime on.

They have a thin crust with a generous amount of cheese + a sparse sprinkle of toppings. Their sauce is the reason I keep coming back--it's tangy with a bit of heat. It's the perfect compliment to their cheesy pizza and would taste good on practically anything.For the price (a bit over $20 for a whole pizza or a few bucks for slice), I do wish that they'd be more generous with the toppings. Also, from a value perspective, not the most cost-efficient which is why I'm giving it 4-stars."
499,"I've been to Sliver Pizzeria over 5 times and I've never had a bad pizza.  Some pizzas are tastier than others though.  Check out Sliver's website to see the pizza of the day!  Sliver only sells one type of pizza each day and the pizza is always vegetarian!  Be sure to warn any meat lovers you may be taking to Sliver with you.  I didn't warn my Filipino meat-loving mom when I took her to Sliver and she was shocked that there weren't any meat pizzas available.  She said she was going to go to Top Dog nearby to get a hot dog to fill her need for meat. -__-  Anyway, when you eat the pizza at Sliver, be sure to put some of the free green sauce on it.  The pizza is not complete without the green sauce.  Also, if you plan to drink alcohol at Sliver, I do not recommend the sangria.  It just tasted like juice and there were no visible fruits in the drink...  It could've been better."
500,"Sliver, the place started by a few former Cheeseboard employees who said the hell with the collective and started serving alcohol, making it a great place to watch a game and have a drink. Won't be a stretch to say that they took a few things with them - mainly the concept of one type of vegetarian pizza daily and that amazing green sauce!The pizza is amazing. Yes, some days are better than others but this is subjective and depends on your pizza preferences. But what's better than an amazing pizza? Amazing pizza you can share with friends while drinking a cold one and watching the game. This is where the two concepts diverge. One is not better than the other, it just depends on what you prefer in the specific case. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Is it a bit overhyped? Sure, but it mostly delivers."
501,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE. It's so hard to chew that my jaw literally hurts so much I don't even want to eat anymore. It's like chewing on cardboard.I definitely DO NOT want to come back here and would rather eat some Dominos, Pizza Hut, pls anything else but this."
502,"I got Sliver delivered by Caviar. The whole pie was 24$ plus taxes $2 something and $4 something for service fee plus 2$ tip. So even though Delivery was free the total charge for whole pizza came out to 33$ for me. Not cheap at all. Probably won't get it delivered again. Today's pizza had potatoes, caramelized onions (according to the menu but I couldn't taste it at all), goat cheese, mozzarella and olive oil. The whole pie came with 2 slivers (1 extra slice) which was a nice touch. The pizza was good and cilantro sauce was yum. It's basically chutney (Indian sauce lol). Overall,Not the best pizza I've had by far but it was good. Definitely wasn't worth what I spent on it."
503,"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Since they've only got one kind of pizza a day the only decision you have to make is how much to order! Another positive to this method is that it's ready immediately - they've just got hot pizzas waiting to be plated.  Between my boyfriend and I, we split a half and I ended up taking home a slice.  Totally reasonable prices - the half was not much more than $12, and they were very generous.There were a lot of flies inside, but what can you expect for a sports bar?  This is a casual spot and clearly popular with all the cal students.  We ate in but will probably do take out next time because parking kind of sucks in the area.They've got an amazing cilantro sauce that goes on the pizza that I would recommend to anyone (even cilantro haters, like myself)!  Love that you don't have to ask for water cups, and there's foil and paper bags to wrap your leftovers in.  Will definitely be back!"
504,"TL;DR 1 AWESOME vegetarian pizza/dayWhat is Sliver:They serve 1 vegetarian pizza each day. Meat lovers: don't be afraid, it will be great, and it will satisfy you.PLUSES:+ location: DT Berkeley, next to BART station & Cal+ vegetarian!! + crust + toppings are awesome, their 1 flavor a day pizza has never disappointed+ check online to see what the toppings of the day are+ their long line can be intimidating, but goes by pretty fastDELTAS:- Not as good as Cheese....."
505,"Oh my god, the green sauce!!! That was the biggest game changer for this place. I first went here when I was visiting my boyfriend in Berkeley. I could eat pizza everyday and this was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas that I have tried. I'm so heartbroken that I don't live anywhere near here because this would for sure be my go to place. The way this place works is that they have one flavor that they serve a day and that's it. And while that may not seem appealing at first it's like a mini adventure to try something that you might not have ever thought of ordering before. Every time I walked by this place it seemed like it was completely packed and every table was taken so that already is a pretty good sign that you're in for something good.About half of a full pizza was about $12 and even sharing that with two people was more than enough especially with the extra slivers that you get on top.I went here on a Thursday so when I went the pizza of the day was the roasted Yukon gold potato pizza. When I first heard that they were gonna be putting potatoes on my pizza I was a little hesitant but after taking one bite I was completely sold. You 100% have to get the green sauce to go with your pizza. It  enhances the flavor so well and makes it 10x better. If you don't use it you're doing it wrong. Can't wait to try the other pizzas of the day when I go back to visit."
506,"I absolutely love this pizza place. I might be a bit sentimental, but I've spent a lot of time with some of my best friends at Slivers. They give you a sliver of pizza every time you order a slice, or two slivers if you order a whole pizza. The first time I had it, I didn't even realize I was eating a vegetarian pizza! Everyday they have a different pizza, and they only serve one type of pizza a day. Super unique, and very efficient. If you like a bit of kick to your pizza, try their green sauce next to the water. It goes so well with any of their pizzas. If you want to find me in Berkeley, Slivers is where I'll be."
507,"3.5 round up / We came here bc the line for Cheeseboard intimidated us. Today's special had corn!!!!! Corn on  pizza is the best. The cilantro green sauce was also good. The line was really short but the service for the bar was quite slow. They check IDs for each beer *_* I'm old af. Below average beer selection. Good place for college or high school dates, lol.I don't actually understand the hype of this place and would only recommend if you are craving pizza in the area."
508,"I came here during memorial day on a recommendation that this is one of the best pizza places in Berkeley. It seems like any other pizza joint styles places with a good beer selection, tv, and pizza. At this point you don't have a menu, you have one pizza. We ordered the half pizza and got 2 slices for free. It seem pretty awesome to get some extra pizza. I enjoyed the ambiance of the pizza place ; Sports bar. Parking is tricky here in the sense that its street parking if you're lucky or the paid parking lot across the street. I came here for lunch when it just opened so it wasn't crowded but given that this is a college town I can see how crowded this gets. I loved the pizza. However I do like my freedom of choice and not being told what to eat. Though this is like a omakase style pizza joint, I'd prefer creating my own pizza place. But if I'm back in Berkeley I would hit up Sliver again or Cheeseboard.GO BEARS!"
509,"I came here on a weekday in the late afternoon to grab a single slice before getting on the Bart. Sliver only offers one flavor of pizza each day and the flavor changes every single day. When I went, the flavor was ""crimini mushrooms, yellow onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, fresh herbs, infused rosemary & chanterelle mushroom olive oil"".The slice comes with a small ""sliver"" on top, which is a nice bonus. The pizza was really oily, so I had to grab some napkins to blot off the oil. The pizza was quite aromatic because of the mushroom olive oil that they used, along with the actual mushrooms on top. The pizza was tasty and flavorful, but I personally didn't find it to be extraordinary and worth the $3.25 (including tax)."
510,"I heard a lot of great things about this place! I went on a Saturday before the lunch rush. I order the special pizza for the day. It had pineapple, arugula, mozzarella and something else. I was surprised when the pizza was tough and hard to bite into. I didn't think it tasted that good. The good thing was the pesto sauce they have on the side. I had to dip my pizza in that so it had some flavor! It could be just this day and the special they had. I see on the menu some of the other specials and it looks bomb. I would come back and try another pizza."
511,"One type of pizza everyday, $3.25 per slice plus you get a little extra sliver. Water dispenser. Delicious pesto sauce condiment. Great outdoor seating as well.Came here to grab a quick bite before a graduation ceremony and was glad to have a full belly."
512,"Sliver is a vegetarian pizza place that serves one type of tasty pizza a day. My favorite flavor so far is definitely the potato and corn, but the other types are also unique and delicious. Occasionally, there are also new unique combinations that feature ingredients like peaches or blue cheese (super interesting to try, you could always buy a slice to try and eat somewhere else closeby if you don't like it). I usually check online to see what flavors they're serving each day that week, since I definitely prefer some pizzas over others. Along with that, there's a green sauce that's a great addition to the the cheesy non-marinara pizzas. They also serve frescas now, which are refreshing and not overly sweet.It's probably important to note that this place is very similar to Cheeseboard, in pizza and concept. Though it's still a quick and affordable place (especially closer to campus) for some delicious pizza."
513,"Pizza here reminds me of their East Bay neighbors The Cheese Board, Arizmendi Bakery, and Nabolom Bakery. All of them are serving one type of vegetarian pizza daily and aiming to create a community around good food including pizza. Prices are more or less similar too.Like The Cheese Board and Nabolom, their green sauce is a must try. Spicy sauce fans forget red chili pepper flakes and grab a few containers of their sauce.What sets Sliver Pizzeria from the rest is the setting. It's a sports bar with a full bar inside, TVs with sports on, long community tables, happy hour specials, and live music Friday's and Saturday's. If you're not in the mood, you can always get it to go or sit outside.I personally prefer Nabolom and Arizmendi's crust, but the pizza here is still solid. Plus, you gotta love those extra baby slices with your pizza."
514,"Food 4/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Bang for your buck 4/5. A great place to catch the games and get some pizzas with high quality ingredients. Note this place only has vegetarian pizza and one flavor per day. Check on their website to see which flavor is showcased today! On any given day, Sliver can get pretty busy, and even busier on days when there is a game playing. However, the line usually moves pretty rapidly because pizzas are continuously being baked. But, you might have a hard time find seating. If it does happen don't worry, it it's a nice day out bring your pizza on the front lawn of UC Berkeley. The one thing that makes it special is they actually provide two slivers with your slice of whole pizza, and hence the name. A really good deal is actually getting a slice of pizza and a salad. All the flavors are really good with top notch ingredients but I usually avoid days where they have tomatoes as a topping, as it doesn't add much to the pizza. I usually go for days where the toppings either include potatoes, or mushrooms or corn (best days). My own trope is that their pizza can get pretty oily because of the cheese. However, the green sauce that you can scoop yourself is pretty amazing and helps tame the oils from the pizza. Overall, it's a solid place to get pizza. I only wished sometimes that they did a meat pizza but I guess you can't have it all. Tips - Its cheaper to get a full pizza for $20 and share it between friends! Pros - High quality ingredients and with only one flavor you don't have to decide which flavor you want! Cons - the pizza can get oily but the green sauce help mitigate that."
515,"Pizza is OK but kinda inconsistent.  We stayed at the restaurant for a couple of hours to watch a warrior game.  The first pizza was good while the second one too oily, had way too much cheese,  and was a little undercooked.   I do like the green sauce but do not like the fact that there is only one type of pizza per day.Happy hour is 3PM - 6PM, you get pizza slivers with your order of alcohol."
516,"Their pizza is very much worth the hype! Always vegetarian and made fresh daily, their changing daily menu makes it easy to go every day. Their website is updated with the menu schedule for the week, so make sure to check it before you go! Their crust itself is more of a flatbread style rather than a fluffy crust style, and is slightly greasier than I'd like, but not more than is expected of a typical pizza. Either way, their pairing of toppings is impeccable, and each one is a delight. My personal favorite is the corn pizza, which I like to drizzle some of their pesto and squeeze a hint of lime on. The only thing is the lines can get pretty crazy during peak times, but service is quick."
517,"My boyfriend took me here as a ""must-go"" staple in Berkeley and I didn't know what to expect! The pizza was SO good - albeit a bit oily, but it's pizza (what do you expect). I had no idea what I was eating (what toppings) because we went in, got 2 slices of pizza, was handed the pizza and then walked out to proceed with our Berkeley food tour. Apparently the pizza of the day was something with kalamata olives (which I thought were some sort of meat) but ALL THEIR PIZZAS ARE VEGETARIAN ! I hope this place continues to change people's perceptions of vegetarian pizzas being less flavorful, delicious or desirable because this pizza was definitely better than many of the meat-included pizzas I've had in my LIFETIME. Definitely worth the visit, prices are reasonable because you're in a college town, good quality, would 10/10 recommend."

539,"I've been to Sliver Pizzeria over 5 times and I've never had a bad pizza.  Some pizzas are tastier than others though.  Check out Sliver's website to see the pizza of the day!  Sliver only sells one type of pizza each day and the pizza is always vegetarian!  Be sure to warn any meat lovers you may be taking to Sliver with you.  I didn't warn my Filipino meat-loving mom when I took her to Sliver and she was shocked that there weren't any meat pizzas available.  She said she was going to go to Top Dog nearby to get a hot dog to fill her need for meat. -__-  Anyway, when you eat the pizza at Sliver, be sure to put some of the free green sauce on it.  The pizza is not complete without the green sauce.  Also, if you plan to drink alcohol at Sliver, I do not recommend the sangria.  It just tasted like juice and there were no visible fruits in the drink...  It could've been better."
540,"Sliver, the place started by a few former Cheeseboard employees who said the hell with the collective and started serving alcohol, making it a great place to watch a game and have a drink. Won't be a stretch to say that they took a few things with them - mainly the concept of one type of vegetarian pizza daily and that amazing green sauce!The pizza is amazing. Yes, some days are better than others but this is subjective and depends on your pizza preferences. But what's better than an amazing pizza? Amazing pizza you can share with friends while drinking a cold one and watching the game. This is where the two concepts diverge. One is not better than the other, it just depends on what you prefer in the specific case. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Is it a bit overhyped? Sure, but it mostly delivers."
541,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE. It's so hard to chew that my jaw literally hurts so much I don't even want to eat anymore. It's like chewing on cardboard.I definitely DO NOT want to come back here and would rather eat some Dominos, Pizza Hut, pls anything else but this."
542,"I got Sliver delivered by Caviar. The whole pie was 24$ plus taxes $2 something and $4 something for service fee plus 2$ tip. So even though Delivery was free the total charge for whole pizza came out to 33$ for me. Not cheap at all. Probably won't get it delivered again. Today's pizza had potatoes, caramelized onions (according to the menu but I couldn't taste it at all), goat cheese, mozzarella and olive oil. The whole pie came with 2 slivers (1 extra slice) which was a nice touch. The pizza was good and cilantro sauce was yum. It's basically chutney (Indian sauce lol). Overall,Not the best pizza I've had by far but it was good. Definitely wasn't worth what I spent on it."
543,"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Since they've only got one kind of pizza a day the only decision you have to make is how much to order! Another positive to this method is that it's ready immediately - they've just got hot pizzas waiting to be plated.  Between my boyfriend and I, we split a half and I ended up taking home a slice.  Totally reasonable prices - the half was not much more than $12, and they were very generous.There were a lot of flies inside, but what can you expect for a sports bar?  This is a casual spot and clearly popular with all the cal students.  We ate in but will probably do take out next time because parking kind of sucks in the area.They've got an amazing cilantro sauce that goes on the pizza that I would recommend to anyone (even cilantro haters, like myself)!  Love that you don't have to ask for water cups, and there's foil and paper bags to wrap your leftovers in.  Will definitely be back!"
544,"TL;DR 1 AWESOME vegetarian pizza/dayWhat is Sliver:They serve 1 vegetarian pizza each day. Meat lovers: don't be afraid, it will be great, and it will satisfy you.PLUSES:+ location: DT Berkeley, next to BART station & Cal+ vegetarian!! + crust + toppings are awesome, their 1 flavor a day pizza has never disappointed+ check online to see what the toppings of the day are+ their long line can be intimidating, but goes by pretty fastDELTAS:- Not as good as Cheese....."
545,"Oh my god, the green sauce!!! That was the biggest game changer for this place. I first went here when I was visiting my boyfriend in Berkeley. I could eat pizza everyday and this was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas that I have tried. I'm so heartbroken that I don't live anywhere near here because this would for sure be my go to place. The way this place works is that they have one flavor that they serve a day and that's it. And while that may not seem appealing at first it's like a mini adventure to try something that you might not have ever thought of ordering before. Every time I walked by this place it seemed like it was completely packed and every table was taken so that already is a pretty good sign that you're in for something good.About half of a full pizza was about $12 and even sharing that with two people was more than enough especially with the extra slivers that you get on top.I went here on a Thursday so when I went the pizza of the day was the roasted Yukon gold potato pizza. When I first heard that they were gonna be putting potatoes on my pizza I was a little hesitant but after taking one bite I was completely sold. You 100% have to get the green sauce to go with your pizza. It  enhances the flavor so well and makes it 10x better. If you don't use it you're doing it wrong. Can't wait to try the other pizzas of the day when I go back to visit."
546,"I absolutely love this pizza place. I might be a bit sentimental, but I've spent a lot of time with some of my best friends at Slivers. They give you a sliver of pizza every time you order a slice, or two slivers if you order a whole pizza. The first time I had it, I didn't even realize I was eating a vegetarian pizza! Everyday they have a different pizza, and they only serve one type of pizza a day. Super unique, and very efficient. If you like a bit of kick to your pizza, try their green sauce next to the water. It goes so well with any of their pizzas. If you want to find me in Berkeley, Slivers is where I'll be."
547,"3.5 round up / We came here bc the line for Cheeseboard intimidated us. Today's special had corn!!!!! Corn on  pizza is the best. The cilantro green sauce was also good. The line was really short but the service for the bar was quite slow. They check IDs for each beer *_* I'm old af. Below average beer selection. Good place for college or high school dates, lol.I don't actually understand the hype of this place and would only recommend if you are craving pizza in the area."
548,"I came here during memorial day on a recommendation that this is one of the best pizza places in Berkeley. It seems like any other pizza joint styles places with a good beer selection, tv, and pizza. At this point you don't have a menu, you have one pizza. We ordered the half pizza and got 2 slices for free. It seem pretty awesome to get some extra pizza. I enjoyed the ambiance of the pizza place ; Sports bar. Parking is tricky here in the sense that its street parking if you're lucky or the paid parking lot across the street. I came here for lunch when it just opened so it wasn't crowded but given that this is a college town I can see how crowded this gets. I loved the pizza. However I do like my freedom of choice and not being told what to eat. Though this is like a omakase style pizza joint, I'd prefer creating my own pizza place. But if I'm back in Berkeley I would hit up Sliver again or Cheeseboard.GO BEARS!"
549,"I came here on a weekday in the late afternoon to grab a single slice before getting on the Bart. Sliver only offers one flavor of pizza each day and the flavor changes every single day. When I went, the flavor was ""crimini mushrooms, yellow onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, fresh herbs, infused rosemary & chanterelle mushroom olive oil"".The slice comes with a small ""sliver"" on top, which is a nice bonus. The pizza was really oily, so I had to grab some napkins to blot off the oil. The pizza was quite aromatic because of the mushroom olive oil that they used, along with the actual mushrooms on top. The pizza was tasty and flavorful, but I personally didn't find it to be extraordinary and worth the $3.25 (including tax)."
550,"I heard a lot of great things about this place! I went on a Saturday before the lunch rush. I order the special pizza for the day. It had pineapple, arugula, mozzarella and something else. I was surprised when the pizza was tough and hard to bite into. I didn't think it tasted that good. The good thing was the pesto sauce they have on the side. I had to dip my pizza in that so it had some flavor! It could be just this day and the special they had. I see on the menu some of the other specials and it looks bomb. I would come back and try another pizza."
551,"One type of pizza everyday, $3.25 per slice plus you get a little extra sliver. Water dispenser. Delicious pesto sauce condiment. Great outdoor seating as well.Came here to grab a quick bite before a graduation ceremony and was glad to have a full belly."
552,"Sliver is a vegetarian pizza place that serves one type of tasty pizza a day. My favorite flavor so far is definitely the potato and corn, but the other types are also unique and delicious. Occasionally, there are also new unique combinations that feature ingredients like peaches or blue cheese (super interesting to try, you could always buy a slice to try and eat somewhere else closeby if you don't like it). I usually check online to see what flavors they're serving each day that week, since I definitely prefer some pizzas over others. Along with that, there's a green sauce that's a great addition to the the cheesy non-marinara pizzas. They also serve frescas now, which are refreshing and not overly sweet.It's probably important to note that this place is very similar to Cheeseboard, in pizza and concept. Though it's still a quick and affordable place (especially closer to campus) for some delicious pizza."
553,"Pizza here reminds me of their East Bay neighbors The Cheese Board, Arizmendi Bakery, and Nabolom Bakery. All of them are serving one type of vegetarian pizza daily and aiming to create a community around good food including pizza. Prices are more or less similar too.Like The Cheese Board and Nabolom, their green sauce is a must try. Spicy sauce fans forget red chili pepper flakes and grab a few containers of their sauce.What sets Sliver Pizzeria from the rest is the setting. It's a sports bar with a full bar inside, TVs with sports on, long community tables, happy hour specials, and live music Friday's and Saturday's. If you're not in the mood, you can always get it to go or sit outside.I personally prefer Nabolom and Arizmendi's crust, but the pizza here is still solid. Plus, you gotta love those extra baby slices with your pizza."
554,"Food 4/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Bang for your buck 4/5. A great place to catch the games and get some pizzas with high quality ingredients. Note this place only has vegetarian pizza and one flavor per day. Check on their website to see which flavor is showcased today! On any given day, Sliver can get pretty busy, and even busier on days when there is a game playing. However, the line usually moves pretty rapidly because pizzas are continuously being baked. But, you might have a hard time find seating. If it does happen don't worry, it it's a nice day out bring your pizza on the front lawn of UC Berkeley. The one thing that makes it special is they actually provide two slivers with your slice of whole pizza, and hence the name. A really good deal is actually getting a slice of pizza and a salad. All the flavors are really good with top notch ingredients but I usually avoid days where they have tomatoes as a topping, as it doesn't add much to the pizza. I usually go for days where the toppings either include potatoes, or mushrooms or corn (best days). My own trope is that their pizza can get pretty oily because of the cheese. However, the green sauce that you can scoop yourself is pretty amazing and helps tame the oils from the pizza. Overall, it's a solid place to get pizza. I only wished sometimes that they did a meat pizza but I guess you can't have it all. Tips - Its cheaper to get a full pizza for $20 and share it between friends! Pros - High quality ingredients and with only one flavor you don't have to decide which flavor you want! Cons - the pizza can get oily but the green sauce help mitigate that."
555,"Pizza is OK but kinda inconsistent.  We stayed at the restaurant for a couple of hours to watch a warrior game.  The first pizza was good while the second one too oily, had way too much cheese,  and was a little undercooked.   I do like the green sauce but do not like the fact that there is only one type of pizza per day.Happy hour is 3PM - 6PM, you get pizza slivers with your order of alcohol."
556,"Their pizza is very much worth the hype! Always vegetarian and made fresh daily, their changing daily menu makes it easy to go every day. Their website is updated with the menu schedule for the week, so make sure to check it before you go! Their crust itself is more of a flatbread style rather than a fluffy crust style, and is slightly greasier than I'd like, but not more than is expected of a typical pizza. Either way, their pairing of toppings is impeccable, and each one is a delight. My personal favorite is the corn pizza, which I like to drizzle some of their pesto and squeeze a hint of lime on. The only thing is the lines can get pretty crazy during peak times, but service is quick."
557,"My boyfriend took me here as a ""must-go"" staple in Berkeley and I didn't know what to expect! The pizza was SO good - albeit a bit oily, but it's pizza (what do you expect). I had no idea what I was eating (what toppings) because we went in, got 2 slices of pizza, was handed the pizza and then walked out to proceed with our Berkeley food tour. Apparently the pizza of the day was something with kalamata olives (which I thought were some sort of meat) but ALL THEIR PIZZAS ARE VEGETARIAN ! I hope this place continues to change people's perceptions of vegetarian pizzas being less flavorful, delicious or desirable because this pizza was definitely better than many of the meat-included pizzas I've had in my LIFETIME. Definitely worth the visit, prices are reasonable because you're in a college town, good quality, would 10/10 recommend."
558,"The green sauce!!! Sliver's green sauce is the main reason I want to eat here all the time.(For reference, I have never tried Cheese Board)Sliver changes their pizza toppings daily, so check their website before going in if you're a picky eater! My favorite pizzas are the ones topped with corn and mushrooms. Their pizzas are more like cheesy bread (think of a flatter version of the cheese bread at Sweet Tomatoes).

Won't be a stretch to say that they took a few things with them - mainly the concept of one type of vegetarian pizza daily and that amazing green sauce!The pizza is amazing. Yes, some days are better than others but this is subjective and depends on your pizza preferences. But what's better than an amazing pizza? Amazing pizza you can share with friends while drinking a cold one and watching the game. This is where the two concepts diverge. One is not better than the other, it just depends on what you prefer in the specific case. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Is it a bit overhyped? Sure, but it mostly delivers."
581,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE. It's so hard to chew that my jaw literally hurts so much I don't even want to eat anymore. It's like chewing on cardboard.I definitely DO NOT want to come back here and would rather eat some Dominos, Pizza Hut, pls anything else but this."
582,"I got Sliver delivered by Caviar. The whole pie was 24$ plus taxes $2 something and $4 something for service fee plus 2$ tip. So even though Delivery was free the total charge for whole pizza came out to 33$ for me. Not cheap at all. Probably won't get it delivered again. Today's pizza had potatoes, caramelized onions (according to the menu but I couldn't taste it at all), goat cheese, mozzarella and olive oil. The whole pie came with 2 slivers (1 extra slice) which was a nice touch. The pizza was good and cilantro sauce was yum. It's basically chutney (Indian sauce lol). Overall,Not the best pizza I've had by far but it was good. Definitely wasn't worth what I spent on it."
583,"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Since they've only got one kind of pizza a day the only decision you have to make is how much to order! Another positive to this method is that it's ready immediately - they've just got hot pizzas waiting to be plated.  Between my boyfriend and I, we split a half and I ended up taking home a slice.  Totally reasonable prices - the half was not much more than $12, and they were very generous.There were a lot of flies inside, but what can you expect for a sports bar?  This is a casual spot and clearly popular with all the cal students.  We ate in but will probably do take out next time because parking kind of sucks in the area.They've got an amazing cilantro sauce that goes on the pizza that I would recommend to anyone (even cilantro haters, like myself)!  Love that you don't have to ask for water cups, and there's foil and paper bags to wrap your leftovers in.  Will definitely be back!"
584,"TL;DR 1 AWESOME vegetarian pizza/dayWhat is Sliver:They serve 1 vegetarian pizza each day. Meat lovers: don't be afraid, it will be great, and it will satisfy you.PLUSES:+ location: DT Berkeley, next to BART station & Cal+ vegetarian!! + crust + toppings are awesome, their 1 flavor a day pizza has never disappointed+ check online to see what the toppings of the day are+ their long line can be intimidating, but goes by pretty fastDELTAS:- Not as good as Cheese....."
585,"Oh my god, the green sauce!!! That was the biggest game changer for this place. I first went here when I was visiting my boyfriend in Berkeley. I could eat pizza everyday and this was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas that I have tried. I'm so heartbroken that I don't live anywhere near here because this would for sure be my go to place. The way this place works is that they have one flavor that they serve a day and that's it. And while that may not seem appealing at first it's like a mini adventure to try something that you might not have ever thought of ordering before. Every time I walked by this place it seemed like it was completely packed and every table was taken so that already is a pretty good sign that you're in for something good.About half of a full pizza was about $12 and even sharing that with two people was more than enough especially with the extra slivers that you get on top.I went here on a Thursday so when I went the pizza of the day was the roasted Yukon gold potato pizza. When I first heard that they were gonna be putting potatoes on my pizza I was a little hesitant but after taking one bite I was completely sold. You 100% have to get the green sauce to go with your pizza. It  enhances the flavor so well and makes it 10x better. If you don't use it you're doing it wrong. Can't wait to try the other pizzas of the day when I go back to visit."
586,"I absolutely love this pizza place. I might be a bit sentimental, but I've spent a lot of time with some of my best friends at Slivers. They give you a sliver of pizza every time you order a slice, or two slivers if you order a whole pizza. The first time I had it, I didn't even realize I was eating a vegetarian pizza! Everyday they have a different pizza, and they only serve one type of pizza a day. Super unique, and very efficient. If you like a bit of kick to your pizza, try their green sauce next to the water. It goes so well with any of their pizzas. If you want to find me in Berkeley, Slivers is where I'll be."
587,"3.5 round up / We came here bc the line for Cheeseboard intimidated us. Today's special had corn!!!!! Corn on  pizza is the best. The cilantro green sauce was also good. The line was really short but the service for the bar was quite slow. They check IDs for each beer *_* I'm old af. Below average beer selection. Good place for college or high school dates, lol.I don't actually understand the hype of this place and would only recommend if you are craving pizza in the area."
588,"I came here during memorial day on a recommendation that this is one of the best pizza places in Berkeley. It seems like any other pizza joint styles places with a good beer selection, tv, and pizza. At this point you don't have a menu, you have one pizza. We ordered the half pizza and got 2 slices for free. It seem pretty awesome to get some extra pizza. I enjoyed the ambiance of the pizza place ; Sports bar. Parking is tricky here in the sense that its street parking if you're lucky or the paid parking lot across the street. I came here for lunch when it just opened so it wasn't crowded but given that this is a college town I can see how crowded this gets. I loved the pizza. However I do like my freedom of choice and not being told what to eat. Though this is like a omakase style pizza joint, I'd prefer creating my own pizza place. But if I'm back in Berkeley I would hit up Sliver again or Cheeseboard.GO BEARS!"
589,"I came here on a weekday in the late afternoon to grab a single slice before getting on the Bart. Sliver only offers one flavor of pizza each day and the flavor changes every single day. When I went, the flavor was ""crimini mushrooms, yellow onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, fresh herbs, infused rosemary & chanterelle mushroom olive oil"".The slice comes with a small ""sliver"" on top, which is a nice bonus. The pizza was really oily, so I had to grab some napkins to blot off the oil. The pizza was quite aromatic because of the mushroom olive oil that they used, along with the actual mushrooms on top. The pizza was tasty and flavorful, but I personally didn't find it to be extraordinary and worth the $3.25 (including tax)."
590,"I heard a lot of great things about this place! I went on a Saturday before the lunch rush. I order the special pizza for the day. It had pineapple, arugula, mozzarella and something else. I was surprised when the pizza was tough and hard to bite into. I didn't think it tasted that good. The good thing was the pesto sauce they have on the side. I had to dip my pizza in that so it had some flavor! It could be just this day and the special they had. I see on the menu some of the other specials and it looks bomb. I would come back and try another pizza."
591,"One type of pizza everyday, $3.25 per slice plus you get a little extra sliver. Water dispenser. Delicious pesto sauce condiment. Great outdoor seating as well.Came here to grab a quick bite before a graduation ceremony and was glad to have a full belly."
592,"Sliver is a vegetarian pizza place that serves one type of tasty pizza a day. My favorite flavor so far is definitely the potato and corn, but the other types are also unique and delicious. Occasionally, there are also new unique combinations that feature ingredients like peaches or blue cheese (super interesting to try, you could always buy a slice to try and eat somewhere else closeby if you don't like it). I usually check online to see what flavors they're serving each day that week, since I definitely prefer some pizzas over others. Along with that, there's a green sauce that's a great addition to the the cheesy non-marinara pizzas. They also serve frescas now, which are refreshing and not overly sweet.It's probably important to note that this place is very similar to Cheeseboard, in pizza and concept. Though it's still a quick and affordable place (especially closer to campus) for some delicious pizza."
593,"Pizza here reminds me of their East Bay neighbors The Cheese Board, Arizmendi Bakery, and Nabolom Bakery. All of them are serving one type of vegetarian pizza daily and aiming to create a community around good food including pizza. Prices are more or less similar too.Like The Cheese Board and Nabolom, their green sauce is a must try. Spicy sauce fans forget red chili pepper flakes and grab a few containers of their sauce.What sets Sliver Pizzeria from the rest is the setting. It's a sports bar with a full bar inside, TVs with sports on, long community tables, happy hour specials, and live music Friday's and Saturday's. If you're not in the mood, you can always get it to go or sit outside.I personally prefer Nabolom and Arizmendi's crust, but the pizza here is still solid. Plus, you gotta love those extra baby slices with your pizza."
594,"Food 4/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Bang for your buck 4/5. A great place to catch the games and get some pizzas with high quality ingredients. Note this place only has vegetarian pizza and one flavor per day. Check on their website to see which flavor is showcased today! On any given day, Sliver can get pretty busy, and even busier on days when there is a game playing. However, the line usually moves pretty rapidly because pizzas are continuously being baked. But, you might have a hard time find seating. If it does happen don't worry, it it's a nice day out bring your pizza on the front lawn of UC Berkeley. The one thing that makes it special is they actually provide two slivers with your slice of whole pizza, and hence the name. A really good deal is actually getting a slice of pizza and a salad. All the flavors are really good with top notch ingredients but I usually avoid days where they have tomatoes as a topping, as it doesn't add much to the pizza. I usually go for days where the toppings either include potatoes, or mushrooms or corn (best days). My own trope is that their pizza can get pretty oily because of the cheese. However, the green sauce that you can scoop yourself is pretty amazing and helps tame the oils from the pizza. Overall, it's a solid place to get pizza. I only wished sometimes that they did a meat pizza but I guess you can't have it all. Tips - Its cheaper to get a full pizza for $20 and share it between friends! Pros - High quality ingredients and with only one flavor you don't have to decide which flavor you want! Cons - the pizza can get oily but the green sauce help mitigate that."
595,"Pizza is OK but kinda inconsistent.  We stayed at the restaurant for a couple of hours to watch a warrior game.  The first pizza was good while the second one too oily, had way too much cheese,  and was a little undercooked.   I do like the green sauce but do not like the fact that there is only one type of pizza per day.Happy hour is 3PM - 6PM, you get pizza slivers with your order of alcohol."
596,"Their pizza is very much worth the hype! Always vegetarian and made fresh daily, their changing daily menu makes it easy to go every day. Their website is updated with the menu schedule for the week, so make sure to check it before you go! Their crust itself is more of a flatbread style rather than a fluffy crust style, and is slightly greasier than I'd like, but not more than is expected of a typical pizza. Either way, their pairing of toppings is impeccable, and each one is a delight. My personal favorite is the corn pizza, which I like to drizzle some of their pesto and squeeze a hint of lime on. The only thing is the lines can get pretty crazy during peak times, but service is quick."
597,"My boyfriend took me here as a ""must-go"" staple in Berkeley and I didn't know what to expect! The pizza was SO good - albeit a bit oily, but it's pizza (what do you expect). I had no idea what I was eating (what toppings) because we went in, got 2 slices of pizza, was handed the pizza and then walked out to proceed with our Berkeley food tour. Apparently the pizza of the day was something with kalamata olives (which I thought were some sort of meat) but ALL THEIR PIZZAS ARE VEGETARIAN ! I hope this place continues to change people's perceptions of vegetarian pizzas being less flavorful, delicious or desirable because this pizza was definitely better than many of the meat-included pizzas I've had in my LIFETIME. Definitely worth the visit, prices are reasonable because you're in a college town, good quality, would 10/10 recommend."
598,"The green sauce!!! Sliver's green sauce is the main reason I want to eat here all the time.(For reference, I have never tried Cheese Board)Sliver changes their pizza toppings daily, so check their website before going in if you're a picky eater! My favorite pizzas are the ones topped with corn and mushrooms. Their pizzas are more like cheesy bread (think of a flatter version of the cheese bread at Sweet Tomatoes). They have a thin crust with a generous amount of cheese + a sparse sprinkle of toppings. Their sauce is the reason I keep coming back--it's tangy with a bit of heat. It's the perfect compliment to their cheesy pizza and would taste good on practically anything.For the price (a bit over $20 for a whole pizza or a few bucks for slice), I do wish that they'd be more generous with the toppings. Also, from a value perspective, not the most cost-efficient which is why I'm giving it 4-stars."

One is not better than the other, it just depends on what you prefer in the specific case. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Is it a bit overhyped? Sure, but it mostly delivers."
621,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE. It's so hard to chew that my jaw literally hurts so much I don't even want to eat anymore. It's like chewing on cardboard.I definitely DO NOT want to come back here and would rather eat some Dominos, Pizza Hut, pls anything else but this."
622,"I got Sliver delivered by Caviar. The whole pie was 24$ plus taxes $2 something and $4 something for service fee plus 2$ tip. So even though Delivery was free the total charge for whole pizza came out to 33$ for me. Not cheap at all. Probably won't get it delivered again. Today's pizza had potatoes, caramelized onions (according to the menu but I couldn't taste it at all), goat cheese, mozzarella and olive oil. The whole pie came with 2 slivers (1 extra slice) which was a nice touch. The pizza was good and cilantro sauce was yum. It's basically chutney (Indian sauce lol). Overall,Not the best pizza I've had by far but it was good. Definitely wasn't worth what I spent on it."
623,"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Since they've only got one kind of pizza a day the only decision you have to make is how much to order! Another positive to this method is that it's ready immediately - they've just got hot pizzas waiting to be plated.  Between my boyfriend and I, we split a half and I ended up taking home a slice.  Totally reasonable prices - the half was not much more than $12, and they were very generous.There were a lot of flies inside, but what can you expect for a sports bar?  This is a casual spot and clearly popular with all the cal students.  We ate in but will probably do take out next time because parking kind of sucks in the area.They've got an amazing cilantro sauce that goes on the pizza that I would recommend to anyone (even cilantro haters, like myself)!  Love that you don't have to ask for water cups, and there's foil and paper bags to wrap your leftovers in.  Will definitely be back!"
624,"TL;DR 1 AWESOME vegetarian pizza/dayWhat is Sliver:They serve 1 vegetarian pizza each day. Meat lovers: don't be afraid, it will be great, and it will satisfy you.PLUSES:+ location: DT Berkeley, next to BART station & Cal+ vegetarian!! + crust + toppings are awesome, their 1 flavor a day pizza has never disappointed+ check online to see what the toppings of the day are+ their long line can be intimidating, but goes by pretty fastDELTAS:- Not as good as Cheese....."
625,"Oh my god, the green sauce!!! That was the biggest game changer for this place. I first went here when I was visiting my boyfriend in Berkeley. I could eat pizza everyday and this was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas that I have tried. I'm so heartbroken that I don't live anywhere near here because this would for sure be my go to place. The way this place works is that they have one flavor that they serve a day and that's it. And while that may not seem appealing at first it's like a mini adventure to try something that you might not have ever thought of ordering before. Every time I walked by this place it seemed like it was completely packed and every table was taken so that already is a pretty good sign that you're in for something good.About half of a full pizza was about $12 and even sharing that with two people was more than enough especially with the extra slivers that you get on top.I went here on a Thursday so when I went the pizza of the day was the roasted Yukon gold potato pizza. When I first heard that they were gonna be putting potatoes on my pizza I was a little hesitant but after taking one bite I was completely sold. You 100% have to get the green sauce to go with your pizza. It  enhances the flavor so well and makes it 10x better. If you don't use it you're doing it wrong. Can't wait to try the other pizzas of the day when I go back to visit."
626,"I absolutely love this pizza place. I might be a bit sentimental, but I've spent a lot of time with some of my best friends at Slivers. They give you a sliver of pizza every time you order a slice, or two slivers if you order a whole pizza. The first time I had it, I didn't even realize I was eating a vegetarian pizza! Everyday they have a different pizza, and they only serve one type of pizza a day. Super unique, and very efficient. If you like a bit of kick to your pizza, try their green sauce next to the water. It goes so well with any of their pizzas. If you want to find me in Berkeley, Slivers is where I'll be."
627,"3.5 round up / We came here bc the line for Cheeseboard intimidated us. Today's special had corn!!!!! Corn on  pizza is the best. The cilantro green sauce was also good. The line was really short but the service for the bar was quite slow. They check IDs for each beer *_* I'm old af. Below average beer selection. Good place for college or high school dates, lol.I don't actually understand the hype of this place and would only recommend if you are craving pizza in the area."
628,"I came here during memorial day on a recommendation that this is one of the best pizza places in Berkeley. It seems like any other pizza joint styles places with a good beer selection, tv, and pizza. At this point you don't have a menu, you have one pizza. We ordered the half pizza and got 2 slices for free. It seem pretty awesome to get some extra pizza. I enjoyed the ambiance of the pizza place ; Sports bar. Parking is tricky here in the sense that its street parking if you're lucky or the paid parking lot across the street. I came here for lunch when it just opened so it wasn't crowded but given that this is a college town I can see how crowded this gets. I loved the pizza. However I do like my freedom of choice and not being told what to eat. Though this is like a omakase style pizza joint, I'd prefer creating my own pizza place. But if I'm back in Berkeley I would hit up Sliver again or Cheeseboard.GO BEARS!"
629,"I came here on a weekday in the late afternoon to grab a single slice before getting on the Bart. Sliver only offers one flavor of pizza each day and the flavor changes every single day. When I went, the flavor was ""crimini mushrooms, yellow onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, fresh herbs, infused rosemary & chanterelle mushroom olive oil"".The slice comes with a small ""sliver"" on top, which is a nice bonus. The pizza was really oily, so I had to grab some napkins to blot off the oil. The pizza was quite aromatic because of the mushroom olive oil that they used, along with the actual mushrooms on top. The pizza was tasty and flavorful, but I personally didn't find it to be extraordinary and worth the $3.25 (including tax)."
630,"I heard a lot of great things about this place! I went on a Saturday before the lunch rush. I order the special pizza for the day. It had pineapple, arugula, mozzarella and something else. I was surprised when the pizza was tough and hard to bite into. I didn't think it tasted that good. The good thing was the pesto sauce they have on the side. I had to dip my pizza in that so it had some flavor! It could be just this day and the special they had. I see on the menu some of the other specials and it looks bomb. I would come back and try another pizza."
631,"One type of pizza everyday, $3.25 per slice plus you get a little extra sliver. Water dispenser. Delicious pesto sauce condiment. Great outdoor seating as well.Came here to grab a quick bite before a graduation ceremony and was glad to have a full belly."
632,"Sliver is a vegetarian pizza place that serves one type of tasty pizza a day. My favorite flavor so far is definitely the potato and corn, but the other types are also unique and delicious. Occasionally, there are also new unique combinations that feature ingredients like peaches or blue cheese (super interesting to try, you could always buy a slice to try and eat somewhere else closeby if you don't like it). I usually check online to see what flavors they're serving each day that week, since I definitely prefer some pizzas over others. Along with that, there's a green sauce that's a great addition to the the cheesy non-marinara pizzas. They also serve frescas now, which are refreshing and not overly sweet.It's probably important to note that this place is very similar to Cheeseboard, in pizza and concept. Though it's still a quick and affordable place (especially closer to campus) for some delicious pizza."
633,"Pizza here reminds me of their East Bay neighbors The Cheese Board, Arizmendi Bakery, and Nabolom Bakery. All of them are serving one type of vegetarian pizza daily and aiming to create a community around good food including pizza. Prices are more or less similar too.Like The Cheese Board and Nabolom, their green sauce is a must try. Spicy sauce fans forget red chili pepper flakes and grab a few containers of their sauce.What sets Sliver Pizzeria from the rest is the setting. It's a sports bar with a full bar inside, TVs with sports on, long community tables, happy hour specials, and live music Friday's and Saturday's. If you're not in the mood, you can always get it to go or sit outside.I personally prefer Nabolom and Arizmendi's crust, but the pizza here is still solid. Plus, you gotta love those extra baby slices with your pizza."
634,"Food 4/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Bang for your buck 4/5. A great place to catch the games and get some pizzas with high quality ingredients. Note this place only has vegetarian pizza and one flavor per day. Check on their website to see which flavor is showcased today! On any given day, Sliver can get pretty busy, and even busier on days when there is a game playing. However, the line usually moves pretty rapidly because pizzas are continuously being baked. But, you might have a hard time find seating. If it does happen don't worry, it it's a nice day out bring your pizza on the front lawn of UC Berkeley. The one thing that makes it special is they actually provide two slivers with your slice of whole pizza, and hence the name. A really good deal is actually getting a slice of pizza and a salad. All the flavors are really good with top notch ingredients but I usually avoid days where they have tomatoes as a topping, as it doesn't add much to the pizza. I usually go for days where the toppings either include potatoes, or mushrooms or corn (best days). My own trope is that their pizza can get pretty oily because of the cheese. However, the green sauce that you can scoop yourself is pretty amazing and helps tame the oils from the pizza. Overall, it's a solid place to get pizza. I only wished sometimes that they did a meat pizza but I guess you can't have it all. Tips - Its cheaper to get a full pizza for $20 and share it between friends! Pros - High quality ingredients and with only one flavor you don't have to decide which flavor you want! Cons - the pizza can get oily but the green sauce help mitigate that."
635,"Pizza is OK but kinda inconsistent.  We stayed at the restaurant for a couple of hours to watch a warrior game.  The first pizza was good while the second one too oily, had way too much cheese,  and was a little undercooked.   I do like the green sauce but do not like the fact that there is only one type of pizza per day.Happy hour is 3PM - 6PM, you get pizza slivers with your order of alcohol."
636,"Their pizza is very much worth the hype! Always vegetarian and made fresh daily, their changing daily menu makes it easy to go every day. Their website is updated with the menu schedule for the week, so make sure to check it before you go! Their crust itself is more of a flatbread style rather than a fluffy crust style, and is slightly greasier than I'd like, but not more than is expected of a typical pizza. Either way, their pairing of toppings is impeccable, and each one is a delight. My personal favorite is the corn pizza, which I like to drizzle some of their pesto and squeeze a hint of lime on. The only thing is the lines can get pretty crazy during peak times, but service is quick."
637,"My boyfriend took me here as a ""must-go"" staple in Berkeley and I didn't know what to expect! The pizza was SO good - albeit a bit oily, but it's pizza (what do you expect). I had no idea what I was eating (what toppings) because we went in, got 2 slices of pizza, was handed the pizza and then walked out to proceed with our Berkeley food tour. Apparently the pizza of the day was something with kalamata olives (which I thought were some sort of meat) but ALL THEIR PIZZAS ARE VEGETARIAN ! I hope this place continues to change people's perceptions of vegetarian pizzas being less flavorful, delicious or desirable because this pizza was definitely better than many of the meat-included pizzas I've had in my LIFETIME. Definitely worth the visit, prices are reasonable because you're in a college town, good quality, would 10/10 recommend."
638,"The green sauce!!! Sliver's green sauce is the main reason I want to eat here all the time.(For reference, I have never tried Cheese Board)Sliver changes their pizza toppings daily, so check their website before going in if you're a picky eater! My favorite pizzas are the ones topped with corn and mushrooms. Their pizzas are more like cheesy bread (think of a flatter version of the cheese bread at Sweet Tomatoes). They have a thin crust with a generous amount of cheese + a sparse sprinkle of toppings. Their sauce is the reason I keep coming back--it's tangy with a bit of heat. It's the perfect compliment to their cheesy pizza and would taste good on practically anything.For the price (a bit over $20 for a whole pizza or a few bucks for slice), I do wish that they'd be more generous with the toppings. Also, from a value perspective, not the most cost-efficient which is why I'm giving it 4-stars."
639,"I've been to Sliver Pizzeria over 5 times and I've never had a bad pizza.  Some pizzas are tastier than others though.  Check out Sliver's website to see the pizza of the day!  Sliver only sells one type of pizza each day and the pizza is always vegetarian!  Be sure to warn any meat lovers you may be taking to Sliver with you.  I didn't warn my Filipino meat-loving mom when I took her to Sliver and she was shocked that there weren't any meat pizzas available.  She said she was going to go to Top Dog nearby to get a hot dog to fill her need for meat. -__-  Anyway, when you eat the pizza at Sliver, be sure to put some of the free green sauce on it.  The pizza is not complete without the green sauce.  Also, if you plan to drink alcohol at Sliver, I do not recommend the sangria.  It just tasted like juice and there were no visible fruits in the drink...  It could've been better."
640,"Sliver, the place started by a few former Cheeseboard employees who said the hell with the collective and started serving alcohol, making it a great place to watch a game and have a drink. Won't be a stretch to say that they took a few things with them - mainly the concept of one type of vegetarian pizza daily and that amazing green sauce!The pizza is amazing. Yes, some days are better than others but this is subjective and depends on your pizza preferences. But what's better than an amazing pizza?

Today's pizza had potatoes, caramelized onions (according to the menu but I couldn't taste it at all), goat cheese, mozzarella and olive oil. The whole pie came with 2 slivers (1 extra slice) which was a nice touch. The pizza was good and cilantro sauce was yum. It's basically chutney (Indian sauce lol). Overall,Not the best pizza I've had by far but it was good. Definitely wasn't worth what I spent on it."
663,"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Since they've only got one kind of pizza a day the only decision you have to make is how much to order! Another positive to this method is that it's ready immediately - they've just got hot pizzas waiting to be plated.  Between my boyfriend and I, we split a half and I ended up taking home a slice.  Totally reasonable prices - the half was not much more than $12, and they were very generous.There were a lot of flies inside, but what can you expect for a sports bar?  This is a casual spot and clearly popular with all the cal students.  We ate in but will probably do take out next time because parking kind of sucks in the area.They've got an amazing cilantro sauce that goes on the pizza that I would recommend to anyone (even cilantro haters, like myself)!  Love that you don't have to ask for water cups, and there's foil and paper bags to wrap your leftovers in.  Will definitely be back!"
664,"TL;DR 1 AWESOME vegetarian pizza/dayWhat is Sliver:They serve 1 vegetarian pizza each day. Meat lovers: don't be afraid, it will be great, and it will satisfy you.PLUSES:+ location: DT Berkeley, next to BART station & Cal+ vegetarian!! + crust + toppings are awesome, their 1 flavor a day pizza has never disappointed+ check online to see what the toppings of the day are+ their long line can be intimidating, but goes by pretty fastDELTAS:- Not as good as Cheese....."
665,"Oh my god, the green sauce!!! That was the biggest game changer for this place. I first went here when I was visiting my boyfriend in Berkeley. I could eat pizza everyday and this was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas that I have tried. I'm so heartbroken that I don't live anywhere near here because this would for sure be my go to place. The way this place works is that they have one flavor that they serve a day and that's it. And while that may not seem appealing at first it's like a mini adventure to try something that you might not have ever thought of ordering before. Every time I walked by this place it seemed like it was completely packed and every table was taken so that already is a pretty good sign that you're in for something good.About half of a full pizza was about $12 and even sharing that with two people was more than enough especially with the extra slivers that you get on top.I went here on a Thursday so when I went the pizza of the day was the roasted Yukon gold potato pizza. When I first heard that they were gonna be putting potatoes on my pizza I was a little hesitant but after taking one bite I was completely sold. You 100% have to get the green sauce to go with your pizza. It  enhances the flavor so well and makes it 10x better. If you don't use it you're doing it wrong. Can't wait to try the other pizzas of the day when I go back to visit."
666,"I absolutely love this pizza place. I might be a bit sentimental, but I've spent a lot of time with some of my best friends at Slivers. They give you a sliver of pizza every time you order a slice, or two slivers if you order a whole pizza. The first time I had it, I didn't even realize I was eating a vegetarian pizza! Everyday they have a different pizza, and they only serve one type of pizza a day. Super unique, and very efficient. If you like a bit of kick to your pizza, try their green sauce next to the water. It goes so well with any of their pizzas. If you want to find me in Berkeley, Slivers is where I'll be."
667,"3.5 round up / We came here bc the line for Cheeseboard intimidated us. Today's special had corn!!!!! Corn on  pizza is the best. The cilantro green sauce was also good. The line was really short but the service for the bar was quite slow. They check IDs for each beer *_* I'm old af. Below average beer selection. Good place for college or high school dates, lol.I don't actually understand the hype of this place and would only recommend if you are craving pizza in the area."
668,"I came here during memorial day on a recommendation that this is one of the best pizza places in Berkeley. It seems like any other pizza joint styles places with a good beer selection, tv, and pizza. At this point you don't have a menu, you have one pizza. We ordered the half pizza and got 2 slices for free. It seem pretty awesome to get some extra pizza. I enjoyed the ambiance of the pizza place ; Sports bar. Parking is tricky here in the sense that its street parking if you're lucky or the paid parking lot across the street. I came here for lunch when it just opened so it wasn't crowded but given that this is a college town I can see how crowded this gets. I loved the pizza. However I do like my freedom of choice and not being told what to eat. Though this is like a omakase style pizza joint, I'd prefer creating my own pizza place. But if I'm back in Berkeley I would hit up Sliver again or Cheeseboard.GO BEARS!"
669,"I came here on a weekday in the late afternoon to grab a single slice before getting on the Bart. Sliver only offers one flavor of pizza each day and the flavor changes every single day. When I went, the flavor was ""crimini mushrooms, yellow onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, fresh herbs, infused rosemary & chanterelle mushroom olive oil"".The slice comes with a small ""sliver"" on top, which is a nice bonus. The pizza was really oily, so I had to grab some napkins to blot off the oil. The pizza was quite aromatic because of the mushroom olive oil that they used, along with the actual mushrooms on top. The pizza was tasty and flavorful, but I personally didn't find it to be extraordinary and worth the $3.25 (including tax)."
670,"I heard a lot of great things about this place! I went on a Saturday before the lunch rush. I order the special pizza for the day. It had pineapple, arugula, mozzarella and something else. I was surprised when the pizza was tough and hard to bite into. I didn't think it tasted that good. The good thing was the pesto sauce they have on the side. I had to dip my pizza in that so it had some flavor! It could be just this day and the special they had. I see on the menu some of the other specials and it looks bomb. I would come back and try another pizza."
671,"One type of pizza everyday, $3.25 per slice plus you get a little extra sliver. Water dispenser. Delicious pesto sauce condiment. Great outdoor seating as well.Came here to grab a quick bite before a graduation ceremony and was glad to have a full belly."
672,"Sliver is a vegetarian pizza place that serves one type of tasty pizza a day. My favorite flavor so far is definitely the potato and corn, but the other types are also unique and delicious. Occasionally, there are also new unique combinations that feature ingredients like peaches or blue cheese (super interesting to try, you could always buy a slice to try and eat somewhere else closeby if you don't like it). I usually check online to see what flavors they're serving each day that week, since I definitely prefer some pizzas over others. Along with that, there's a green sauce that's a great addition to the the cheesy non-marinara pizzas. They also serve frescas now, which are refreshing and not overly sweet.It's probably important to note that this place is very similar to Cheeseboard, in pizza and concept. Though it's still a quick and affordable place (especially closer to campus) for some delicious pizza."
673,"Pizza here reminds me of their East Bay neighbors The Cheese Board, Arizmendi Bakery, and Nabolom Bakery. All of them are serving one type of vegetarian pizza daily and aiming to create a community around good food including pizza. Prices are more or less similar too.Like The Cheese Board and Nabolom, their green sauce is a must try. Spicy sauce fans forget red chili pepper flakes and grab a few containers of their sauce.What sets Sliver Pizzeria from the rest is the setting. It's a sports bar with a full bar inside, TVs with sports on, long community tables, happy hour specials, and live music Friday's and Saturday's. If you're not in the mood, you can always get it to go or sit outside.I personally prefer Nabolom and Arizmendi's crust, but the pizza here is still solid. Plus, you gotta love those extra baby slices with your pizza."
674,"Food 4/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Bang for your buck 4/5. A great place to catch the games and get some pizzas with high quality ingredients. Note this place only has vegetarian pizza and one flavor per day. Check on their website to see which flavor is showcased today! On any given day, Sliver can get pretty busy, and even busier on days when there is a game playing. However, the line usually moves pretty rapidly because pizzas are continuously being baked. But, you might have a hard time find seating. If it does happen don't worry, it it's a nice day out bring your pizza on the front lawn of UC Berkeley. The one thing that makes it special is they actually provide two slivers with your slice of whole pizza, and hence the name. A really good deal is actually getting a slice of pizza and a salad. All the flavors are really good with top notch ingredients but I usually avoid days where they have tomatoes as a topping, as it doesn't add much to the pizza. I usually go for days where the toppings either include potatoes, or mushrooms or corn (best days). My own trope is that their pizza can get pretty oily because of the cheese. However, the green sauce that you can scoop yourself is pretty amazing and helps tame the oils from the pizza. Overall, it's a solid place to get pizza. I only wished sometimes that they did a meat pizza but I guess you can't have it all. Tips - Its cheaper to get a full pizza for $20 and share it between friends! Pros - High quality ingredients and with only one flavor you don't have to decide which flavor you want! Cons - the pizza can get oily but the green sauce help mitigate that."
675,"Pizza is OK but kinda inconsistent.  We stayed at the restaurant for a couple of hours to watch a warrior game.  The first pizza was good while the second one too oily, had way too much cheese,  and was a little undercooked.   I do like the green sauce but do not like the fact that there is only one type of pizza per day.Happy hour is 3PM - 6PM, you get pizza slivers with your order of alcohol."
676,"Their pizza is very much worth the hype! Always vegetarian and made fresh daily, their changing daily menu makes it easy to go every day. Their website is updated with the menu schedule for the week, so make sure to check it before you go! Their crust itself is more of a flatbread style rather than a fluffy crust style, and is slightly greasier than I'd like, but not more than is expected of a typical pizza. Either way, their pairing of toppings is impeccable, and each one is a delight. My personal favorite is the corn pizza, which I like to drizzle some of their pesto and squeeze a hint of lime on. The only thing is the lines can get pretty crazy during peak times, but service is quick."
677,"My boyfriend took me here as a ""must-go"" staple in Berkeley and I didn't know what to expect! The pizza was SO good - albeit a bit oily, but it's pizza (what do you expect). I had no idea what I was eating (what toppings) because we went in, got 2 slices of pizza, was handed the pizza and then walked out to proceed with our Berkeley food tour. Apparently the pizza of the day was something with kalamata olives (which I thought were some sort of meat) but ALL THEIR PIZZAS ARE VEGETARIAN ! I hope this place continues to change people's perceptions of vegetarian pizzas being less flavorful, delicious or desirable because this pizza was definitely better than many of the meat-included pizzas I've had in my LIFETIME. Definitely worth the visit, prices are reasonable because you're in a college town, good quality, would 10/10 recommend."
678,"The green sauce!!! Sliver's green sauce is the main reason I want to eat here all the time.(For reference, I have never tried Cheese Board)Sliver changes their pizza toppings daily, so check their website before going in if you're a picky eater! My favorite pizzas are the ones topped with corn and mushrooms. Their pizzas are more like cheesy bread (think of a flatter version of the cheese bread at Sweet Tomatoes). They have a thin crust with a generous amount of cheese + a sparse sprinkle of toppings. Their sauce is the reason I keep coming back--it's tangy with a bit of heat. It's the perfect compliment to their cheesy pizza and would taste good on practically anything.For the price (a bit over $20 for a whole pizza or a few bucks for slice), I do wish that they'd be more generous with the toppings. Also, from a value perspective, not the most cost-efficient which is why I'm giving it 4-stars."
679,"I've been to Sliver Pizzeria over 5 times and I've never had a bad pizza.  Some pizzas are tastier than others though.  Check out Sliver's website to see the pizza of the day!  Sliver only sells one type of pizza each day and the pizza is always vegetarian!  Be sure to warn any meat lovers you may be taking to Sliver with you.  I didn't warn my Filipino meat-loving mom when I took her to Sliver and she was shocked that there weren't any meat pizzas available.  She said she was going to go to Top Dog nearby to get a hot dog to fill her need for meat. -__-  Anyway, when you eat the pizza at Sliver, be sure to put some of the free green sauce on it.  The pizza is not complete without the green sauce.  Also, if you plan to drink alcohol at Sliver, I do not recommend the sangria.  It just tasted like juice and there were no visible fruits in the drink...  It could've been better."
680,"Sliver, the place started by a few former Cheeseboard employees who said the hell with the collective and started serving alcohol, making it a great place to watch a game and have a drink. Won't be a stretch to say that they took a few things with them - mainly the concept of one type of vegetarian pizza daily and that amazing green sauce!The pizza is amazing. Yes, some days are better than others but this is subjective and depends on your pizza preferences. But what's better than an amazing pizza? Amazing pizza you can share with friends while drinking a cold one and watching the game. This is where the two concepts diverge. One is not better than the other, it just depends on what you prefer in the specific case. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Is it a bit overhyped? Sure, but it mostly delivers."
681,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE. It's so hard to chew that my jaw literally hurts so much I don't even want to eat anymore. It's like chewing on cardboard.I definitely DO NOT want to come back here and would rather eat some Dominos, Pizza Hut, pls anything else but this."

Another positive to this method is that it's ready immediately - they've just got hot pizzas waiting to be plated.  Between my boyfriend and I, we split a half and I ended up taking home a slice.  Totally reasonable prices - the half was not much more than $12, and they were very generous.There were a lot of flies inside, but what can you expect for a sports bar?  This is a casual spot and clearly popular with all the cal students.  We ate in but will probably do take out next time because parking kind of sucks in the area.They've got an amazing cilantro sauce that goes on the pizza that I would recommend to anyone (even cilantro haters, like myself)!  Love that you don't have to ask for water cups, and there's foil and paper bags to wrap your leftovers in.  Will definitely be back!"
704,"TL;DR 1 AWESOME vegetarian pizza/dayWhat is Sliver:They serve 1 vegetarian pizza each day. Meat lovers: don't be afraid, it will be great, and it will satisfy you.PLUSES:+ location: DT Berkeley, next to BART station & Cal+ vegetarian!! + crust + toppings are awesome, their 1 flavor a day pizza has never disappointed+ check online to see what the toppings of the day are+ their long line can be intimidating, but goes by pretty fastDELTAS:- Not as good as Cheese....."
705,"Oh my god, the green sauce!!! That was the biggest game changer for this place. I first went here when I was visiting my boyfriend in Berkeley. I could eat pizza everyday and this was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas that I have tried. I'm so heartbroken that I don't live anywhere near here because this would for sure be my go to place. The way this place works is that they have one flavor that they serve a day and that's it. And while that may not seem appealing at first it's like a mini adventure to try something that you might not have ever thought of ordering before. Every time I walked by this place it seemed like it was completely packed and every table was taken so that already is a pretty good sign that you're in for something good.About half of a full pizza was about $12 and even sharing that with two people was more than enough especially with the extra slivers that you get on top.I went here on a Thursday so when I went the pizza of the day was the roasted Yukon gold potato pizza. When I first heard that they were gonna be putting potatoes on my pizza I was a little hesitant but after taking one bite I was completely sold. You 100% have to get the green sauce to go with your pizza. It  enhances the flavor so well and makes it 10x better. If you don't use it you're doing it wrong. Can't wait to try the other pizzas of the day when I go back to visit."
706,"I absolutely love this pizza place. I might be a bit sentimental, but I've spent a lot of time with some of my best friends at Slivers. They give you a sliver of pizza every time you order a slice, or two slivers if you order a whole pizza. The first time I had it, I didn't even realize I was eating a vegetarian pizza! Everyday they have a different pizza, and they only serve one type of pizza a day. Super unique, and very efficient. If you like a bit of kick to your pizza, try their green sauce next to the water. It goes so well with any of their pizzas. If you want to find me in Berkeley, Slivers is where I'll be."
707,"3.5 round up / We came here bc the line for Cheeseboard intimidated us. Today's special had corn!!!!! Corn on  pizza is the best. The cilantro green sauce was also good. The line was really short but the service for the bar was quite slow. They check IDs for each beer *_* I'm old af. Below average beer selection. Good place for college or high school dates, lol.I don't actually understand the hype of this place and would only recommend if you are craving pizza in the area."
708,"I came here during memorial day on a recommendation that this is one of the best pizza places in Berkeley. It seems like any other pizza joint styles places with a good beer selection, tv, and pizza. At this point you don't have a menu, you have one pizza. We ordered the half pizza and got 2 slices for free. It seem pretty awesome to get some extra pizza. I enjoyed the ambiance of the pizza place ; Sports bar. Parking is tricky here in the sense that its street parking if you're lucky or the paid parking lot across the street. I came here for lunch when it just opened so it wasn't crowded but given that this is a college town I can see how crowded this gets. I loved the pizza. However I do like my freedom of choice and not being told what to eat. Though this is like a omakase style pizza joint, I'd prefer creating my own pizza place. But if I'm back in Berkeley I would hit up Sliver again or Cheeseboard.GO BEARS!"
709,"I came here on a weekday in the late afternoon to grab a single slice before getting on the Bart. Sliver only offers one flavor of pizza each day and the flavor changes every single day. When I went, the flavor was ""crimini mushrooms, yellow onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, fresh herbs, infused rosemary & chanterelle mushroom olive oil"".The slice comes with a small ""sliver"" on top, which is a nice bonus. The pizza was really oily, so I had to grab some napkins to blot off the oil. The pizza was quite aromatic because of the mushroom olive oil that they used, along with the actual mushrooms on top. The pizza was tasty and flavorful, but I personally didn't find it to be extraordinary and worth the $3.25 (including tax)."
710,"I heard a lot of great things about this place! I went on a Saturday before the lunch rush. I order the special pizza for the day. It had pineapple, arugula, mozzarella and something else. I was surprised when the pizza was tough and hard to bite into. I didn't think it tasted that good. The good thing was the pesto sauce they have on the side. I had to dip my pizza in that so it had some flavor! It could be just this day and the special they had. I see on the menu some of the other specials and it looks bomb. I would come back and try another pizza."
711,"One type of pizza everyday, $3.25 per slice plus you get a little extra sliver. Water dispenser. Delicious pesto sauce condiment. Great outdoor seating as well.Came here to grab a quick bite before a graduation ceremony and was glad to have a full belly."
712,"Sliver is a vegetarian pizza place that serves one type of tasty pizza a day. My favorite flavor so far is definitely the potato and corn, but the other types are also unique and delicious. Occasionally, there are also new unique combinations that feature ingredients like peaches or blue cheese (super interesting to try, you could always buy a slice to try and eat somewhere else closeby if you don't like it). I usually check online to see what flavors they're serving each day that week, since I definitely prefer some pizzas over others. Along with that, there's a green sauce that's a great addition to the the cheesy non-marinara pizzas. They also serve frescas now, which are refreshing and not overly sweet.It's probably important to note that this place is very similar to Cheeseboard, in pizza and concept. Though it's still a quick and affordable place (especially closer to campus) for some delicious pizza."
713,"Pizza here reminds me of their East Bay neighbors The Cheese Board, Arizmendi Bakery, and Nabolom Bakery. All of them are serving one type of vegetarian pizza daily and aiming to create a community around good food including pizza. Prices are more or less similar too.Like The Cheese Board and Nabolom, their green sauce is a must try. Spicy sauce fans forget red chili pepper flakes and grab a few containers of their sauce.What sets Sliver Pizzeria from the rest is the setting. It's a sports bar with a full bar inside, TVs with sports on, long community tables, happy hour specials, and live music Friday's and Saturday's. If you're not in the mood, you can always get it to go or sit outside.I personally prefer Nabolom and Arizmendi's crust, but the pizza here is still solid. Plus, you gotta love those extra baby slices with your pizza."
714,"Food 4/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Bang for your buck 4/5. A great place to catch the games and get some pizzas with high quality ingredients. Note this place only has vegetarian pizza and one flavor per day. Check on their website to see which flavor is showcased today! On any given day, Sliver can get pretty busy, and even busier on days when there is a game playing. However, the line usually moves pretty rapidly because pizzas are continuously being baked. But, you might have a hard time find seating. If it does happen don't worry, it it's a nice day out bring your pizza on the front lawn of UC Berkeley. The one thing that makes it special is they actually provide two slivers with your slice of whole pizza, and hence the name. A really good deal is actually getting a slice of pizza and a salad. All the flavors are really good with top notch ingredients but I usually avoid days where they have tomatoes as a topping, as it doesn't add much to the pizza. I usually go for days where the toppings either include potatoes, or mushrooms or corn (best days). My own trope is that their pizza can get pretty oily because of the cheese. However, the green sauce that you can scoop yourself is pretty amazing and helps tame the oils from the pizza. Overall, it's a solid place to get pizza. I only wished sometimes that they did a meat pizza but I guess you can't have it all. Tips - Its cheaper to get a full pizza for $20 and share it between friends! Pros - High quality ingredients and with only one flavor you don't have to decide which flavor you want! Cons - the pizza can get oily but the green sauce help mitigate that."
715,"Pizza is OK but kinda inconsistent.  We stayed at the restaurant for a couple of hours to watch a warrior game.  The first pizza was good while the second one too oily, had way too much cheese,  and was a little undercooked.   I do like the green sauce but do not like the fact that there is only one type of pizza per day.Happy hour is 3PM - 6PM, you get pizza slivers with your order of alcohol."
716,"Their pizza is very much worth the hype! Always vegetarian and made fresh daily, their changing daily menu makes it easy to go every day. Their website is updated with the menu schedule for the week, so make sure to check it before you go! Their crust itself is more of a flatbread style rather than a fluffy crust style, and is slightly greasier than I'd like, but not more than is expected of a typical pizza. Either way, their pairing of toppings is impeccable, and each one is a delight. My personal favorite is the corn pizza, which I like to drizzle some of their pesto and squeeze a hint of lime on. The only thing is the lines can get pretty crazy during peak times, but service is quick."
717,"My boyfriend took me here as a ""must-go"" staple in Berkeley and I didn't know what to expect! The pizza was SO good - albeit a bit oily, but it's pizza (what do you expect). I had no idea what I was eating (what toppings) because we went in, got 2 slices of pizza, was handed the pizza and then walked out to proceed with our Berkeley food tour. Apparently the pizza of the day was something with kalamata olives (which I thought were some sort of meat) but ALL THEIR PIZZAS ARE VEGETARIAN ! I hope this place continues to change people's perceptions of vegetarian pizzas being less flavorful, delicious or desirable because this pizza was definitely better than many of the meat-included pizzas I've had in my LIFETIME. Definitely worth the visit, prices are reasonable because you're in a college town, good quality, would 10/10 recommend."
718,"The green sauce!!! Sliver's green sauce is the main reason I want to eat here all the time.(For reference, I have never tried Cheese Board)Sliver changes their pizza toppings daily, so check their website before going in if you're a picky eater! My favorite pizzas are the ones topped with corn and mushrooms. Their pizzas are more like cheesy bread (think of a flatter version of the cheese bread at Sweet Tomatoes). They have a thin crust with a generous amount of cheese + a sparse sprinkle of toppings. Their sauce is the reason I keep coming back--it's tangy with a bit of heat. It's the perfect compliment to their cheesy pizza and would taste good on practically anything.For the price (a bit over $20 for a whole pizza or a few bucks for slice), I do wish that they'd be more generous with the toppings. Also, from a value perspective, not the most cost-efficient which is why I'm giving it 4-stars."
719,"I've been to Sliver Pizzeria over 5 times and I've never had a bad pizza.  Some pizzas are tastier than others though.  Check out Sliver's website to see the pizza of the day!  Sliver only sells one type of pizza each day and the pizza is always vegetarian!  Be sure to warn any meat lovers you may be taking to Sliver with you.  I didn't warn my Filipino meat-loving mom when I took her to Sliver and she was shocked that there weren't any meat pizzas available.  She said she was going to go to Top Dog nearby to get a hot dog to fill her need for meat. -__-  Anyway, when you eat the pizza at Sliver, be sure to put some of the free green sauce on it.  The pizza is not complete without the green sauce.  Also, if you plan to drink alcohol at Sliver, I do not recommend the sangria.  It just tasted like juice and there were no visible fruits in the drink...  It could've been better."
720,"Sliver, the place started by a few former Cheeseboard employees who said the hell with the collective and started serving alcohol, making it a great place to watch a game and have a drink. Won't be a stretch to say that they took a few things with them - mainly the concept of one type of vegetarian pizza daily and that amazing green sauce!The pizza is amazing. Yes, some days are better than others but this is subjective and depends on your pizza preferences. But what's better than an amazing pizza? Amazing pizza you can share with friends while drinking a cold one and watching the game. This is where the two concepts diverge. One is not better than the other, it just depends on what you prefer in the specific case. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Is it a bit overhyped? Sure, but it mostly delivers."
721,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE. It's so hard to chew that my jaw literally hurts so much I don't even want to eat anymore. It's like chewing on cardboard.I definitely DO NOT want to come back here and would rather eat some Dominos, Pizza Hut, pls anything else but this."
722,"I got Sliver delivered by Caviar. The whole pie was 24$ plus taxes $2 something and $4 something for service fee plus 2$ tip. So even though Delivery was free the total charge for whole pizza came out to 33$ for me. Not cheap at all. Probably won't get it delivered again. Today's pizza had potatoes, caramelized onions (according to the menu but I couldn't taste it at all), goat cheese, mozzarella and olive oil. The whole pie came with 2 slivers (1 extra slice) which was a nice touch. The pizza was good and cilantro sauce was yum. It's basically chutney (Indian sauce lol). Overall,Not the best pizza I've had by far but it was good. Definitely wasn't worth what I spent on it."

745,"Oh my god, the green sauce!!! That was the biggest game changer for this place. I first went here when I was visiting my boyfriend in Berkeley. I could eat pizza everyday and this was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas that I have tried. I'm so heartbroken that I don't live anywhere near here because this would for sure be my go to place. The way this place works is that they have one flavor that they serve a day and that's it. And while that may not seem appealing at first it's like a mini adventure to try something that you might not have ever thought of ordering before. Every time I walked by this place it seemed like it was completely packed and every table was taken so that already is a pretty good sign that you're in for something good.About half of a full pizza was about $12 and even sharing that with two people was more than enough especially with the extra slivers that you get on top.I went here on a Thursday so when I went the pizza of the day was the roasted Yukon gold potato pizza. When I first heard that they were gonna be putting potatoes on my pizza I was a little hesitant but after taking one bite I was completely sold. You 100% have to get the green sauce to go with your pizza. It  enhances the flavor so well and makes it 10x better. If you don't use it you're doing it wrong. Can't wait to try the other pizzas of the day when I go back to visit."
746,"I absolutely love this pizza place. I might be a bit sentimental, but I've spent a lot of time with some of my best friends at Slivers. They give you a sliver of pizza every time you order a slice, or two slivers if you order a whole pizza. The first time I had it, I didn't even realize I was eating a vegetarian pizza! Everyday they have a different pizza, and they only serve one type of pizza a day. Super unique, and very efficient. If you like a bit of kick to your pizza, try their green sauce next to the water. It goes so well with any of their pizzas. If you want to find me in Berkeley, Slivers is where I'll be."
747,"3.5 round up / We came here bc the line for Cheeseboard intimidated us. Today's special had corn!!!!! Corn on  pizza is the best. The cilantro green sauce was also good. The line was really short but the service for the bar was quite slow. They check IDs for each beer *_* I'm old af. Below average beer selection. Good place for college or high school dates, lol.I don't actually understand the hype of this place and would only recommend if you are craving pizza in the area."
748,"I came here during memorial day on a recommendation that this is one of the best pizza places in Berkeley. It seems like any other pizza joint styles places with a good beer selection, tv, and pizza. At this point you don't have a menu, you have one pizza. We ordered the half pizza and got 2 slices for free. It seem pretty awesome to get some extra pizza. I enjoyed the ambiance of the pizza place ; Sports bar. Parking is tricky here in the sense that its street parking if you're lucky or the paid parking lot across the street. I came here for lunch when it just opened so it wasn't crowded but given that this is a college town I can see how crowded this gets. I loved the pizza. However I do like my freedom of choice and not being told what to eat. Though this is like a omakase style pizza joint, I'd prefer creating my own pizza place. But if I'm back in Berkeley I would hit up Sliver again or Cheeseboard.GO BEARS!"
749,"I came here on a weekday in the late afternoon to grab a single slice before getting on the Bart. Sliver only offers one flavor of pizza each day and the flavor changes every single day. When I went, the flavor was ""crimini mushrooms, yellow onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, fresh herbs, infused rosemary & chanterelle mushroom olive oil"".The slice comes with a small ""sliver"" on top, which is a nice bonus. The pizza was really oily, so I had to grab some napkins to blot off the oil. The pizza was quite aromatic because of the mushroom olive oil that they used, along with the actual mushrooms on top. The pizza was tasty and flavorful, but I personally didn't find it to be extraordinary and worth the $3.25 (including tax)."
750,"I heard a lot of great things about this place! I went on a Saturday before the lunch rush. I order the special pizza for the day. It had pineapple, arugula, mozzarella and something else. I was surprised when the pizza was tough and hard to bite into. I didn't think it tasted that good. The good thing was the pesto sauce they have on the side. I had to dip my pizza in that so it had some flavor! It could be just this day and the special they had. I see on the menu some of the other specials and it looks bomb. I would come back and try another pizza."
751,"One type of pizza everyday, $3.25 per slice plus you get a little extra sliver. Water dispenser. Delicious pesto sauce condiment. Great outdoor seating as well.Came here to grab a quick bite before a graduation ceremony and was glad to have a full belly."
752,"Sliver is a vegetarian pizza place that serves one type of tasty pizza a day. My favorite flavor so far is definitely the potato and corn, but the other types are also unique and delicious. Occasionally, there are also new unique combinations that feature ingredients like peaches or blue cheese (super interesting to try, you could always buy a slice to try and eat somewhere else closeby if you don't like it). I usually check online to see what flavors they're serving each day that week, since I definitely prefer some pizzas over others. Along with that, there's a green sauce that's a great addition to the the cheesy non-marinara pizzas. They also serve frescas now, which are refreshing and not overly sweet.It's probably important to note that this place is very similar to Cheeseboard, in pizza and concept. Though it's still a quick and affordable place (especially closer to campus) for some delicious pizza."
753,"Pizza here reminds me of their East Bay neighbors The Cheese Board, Arizmendi Bakery, and Nabolom Bakery. All of them are serving one type of vegetarian pizza daily and aiming to create a community around good food including pizza. Prices are more or less similar too.Like The Cheese Board and Nabolom, their green sauce is a must try. Spicy sauce fans forget red chili pepper flakes and grab a few containers of their sauce.What sets Sliver Pizzeria from the rest is the setting. It's a sports bar with a full bar inside, TVs with sports on, long community tables, happy hour specials, and live music Friday's and Saturday's. If you're not in the mood, you can always get it to go or sit outside.I personally prefer Nabolom and Arizmendi's crust, but the pizza here is still solid. Plus, you gotta love those extra baby slices with your pizza."
754,"Food 4/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Bang for your buck 4/5. A great place to catch the games and get some pizzas with high quality ingredients. Note this place only has vegetarian pizza and one flavor per day. Check on their website to see which flavor is showcased today! On any given day, Sliver can get pretty busy, and even busier on days when there is a game playing. However, the line usually moves pretty rapidly because pizzas are continuously being baked. But, you might have a hard time find seating. If it does happen don't worry, it it's a nice day out bring your pizza on the front lawn of UC Berkeley. The one thing that makes it special is they actually provide two slivers with your slice of whole pizza, and hence the name. A really good deal is actually getting a slice of pizza and a salad. All the flavors are really good with top notch ingredients but I usually avoid days where they have tomatoes as a topping, as it doesn't add much to the pizza. I usually go for days where the toppings either include potatoes, or mushrooms or corn (best days). My own trope is that their pizza can get pretty oily because of the cheese. However, the green sauce that you can scoop yourself is pretty amazing and helps tame the oils from the pizza. Overall, it's a solid place to get pizza. I only wished sometimes that they did a meat pizza but I guess you can't have it all. Tips - Its cheaper to get a full pizza for $20 and share it between friends! Pros - High quality ingredients and with only one flavor you don't have to decide which flavor you want! Cons - the pizza can get oily but the green sauce help mitigate that."
755,"Pizza is OK but kinda inconsistent.  We stayed at the restaurant for a couple of hours to watch a warrior game.  The first pizza was good while the second one too oily, had way too much cheese,  and was a little undercooked.   I do like the green sauce but do not like the fact that there is only one type of pizza per day.Happy hour is 3PM - 6PM, you get pizza slivers with your order of alcohol."
756,"Their pizza is very much worth the hype! Always vegetarian and made fresh daily, their changing daily menu makes it easy to go every day. Their website is updated with the menu schedule for the week, so make sure to check it before you go! Their crust itself is more of a flatbread style rather than a fluffy crust style, and is slightly greasier than I'd like, but not more than is expected of a typical pizza. Either way, their pairing of toppings is impeccable, and each one is a delight. My personal favorite is the corn pizza, which I like to drizzle some of their pesto and squeeze a hint of lime on. The only thing is the lines can get pretty crazy during peak times, but service is quick."
757,"My boyfriend took me here as a ""must-go"" staple in Berkeley and I didn't know what to expect! The pizza was SO good - albeit a bit oily, but it's pizza (what do you expect). I had no idea what I was eating (what toppings) because we went in, got 2 slices of pizza, was handed the pizza and then walked out to proceed with our Berkeley food tour. Apparently the pizza of the day was something with kalamata olives (which I thought were some sort of meat) but ALL THEIR PIZZAS ARE VEGETARIAN ! I hope this place continues to change people's perceptions of vegetarian pizzas being less flavorful, delicious or desirable because this pizza was definitely better than many of the meat-included pizzas I've had in my LIFETIME. Definitely worth the visit, prices are reasonable because you're in a college town, good quality, would 10/10 recommend."
758,"The green sauce!!! Sliver's green sauce is the main reason I want to eat here all the time.(For reference, I have never tried Cheese Board)Sliver changes their pizza toppings daily, so check their website before going in if you're a picky eater! My favorite pizzas are the ones topped with corn and mushrooms. Their pizzas are more like cheesy bread (think of a flatter version of the cheese bread at Sweet Tomatoes). They have a thin crust with a generous amount of cheese + a sparse sprinkle of toppings. Their sauce is the reason I keep coming back--it's tangy with a bit of heat. It's the perfect compliment to their cheesy pizza and would taste good on practically anything.For the price (a bit over $20 for a whole pizza or a few bucks for slice), I do wish that they'd be more generous with the toppings. Also, from a value perspective, not the most cost-efficient which is why I'm giving it 4-stars."
759,"I've been to Sliver Pizzeria over 5 times and I've never had a bad pizza.  Some pizzas are tastier than others though.  Check out Sliver's website to see the pizza of the day!  Sliver only sells one type of pizza each day and the pizza is always vegetarian!  Be sure to warn any meat lovers you may be taking to Sliver with you.  I didn't warn my Filipino meat-loving mom when I took her to Sliver and she was shocked that there weren't any meat pizzas available.  She said she was going to go to Top Dog nearby to get a hot dog to fill her need for meat. -__-  Anyway, when you eat the pizza at Sliver, be sure to put some of the free green sauce on it.  The pizza is not complete without the green sauce.  Also, if you plan to drink alcohol at Sliver, I do not recommend the sangria.  It just tasted like juice and there were no visible fruits in the drink...  It could've been better."
760,"Sliver, the place started by a few former Cheeseboard employees who said the hell with the collective and started serving alcohol, making it a great place to watch a game and have a drink. Won't be a stretch to say that they took a few things with them - mainly the concept of one type of vegetarian pizza daily and that amazing green sauce!The pizza is amazing. Yes, some days are better than others but this is subjective and depends on your pizza preferences. But what's better than an amazing pizza? Amazing pizza you can share with friends while drinking a cold one and watching the game. This is where the two concepts diverge. One is not better than the other, it just depends on what you prefer in the specific case. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Is it a bit overhyped? Sure, but it mostly delivers."
761,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE. It's so hard to chew that my jaw literally hurts so much I don't even want to eat anymore. It's like chewing on cardboard.I definitely DO NOT want to come back here and would rather eat some Dominos, Pizza Hut, pls anything else but this."
762,"I got Sliver delivered by Caviar. The whole pie was 24$ plus taxes $2 something and $4 something for service fee plus 2$ tip. So even though Delivery was free the total charge for whole pizza came out to 33$ for me. Not cheap at all. Probably won't get it delivered again. Today's pizza had potatoes, caramelized onions (according to the menu but I couldn't taste it at all), goat cheese, mozzarella and olive oil. The whole pie came with 2 slivers (1 extra slice) which was a nice touch. The pizza was good and cilantro sauce was yum. It's basically chutney (Indian sauce lol). Overall,Not the best pizza I've had by far but it was good. Definitely wasn't worth what I spent on it."
763,"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Since they've only got one kind of pizza a day the only decision you have to make is how much to order! Another positive to this method is that it's ready immediately - they've just got hot pizzas waiting to be plated.  Between my boyfriend and I, we split a half and I ended up taking home a slice.  Totally reasonable prices - the half was not much more than $12, and they were very generous.There were a lot of flies inside, but what can you expect for a sports bar?  This is a casual spot and clearly popular with all the cal students.  We ate in but will probably do take out next time because parking kind of sucks in the area.They've got an amazing cilantro sauce that goes on the pizza that I would recommend to anyone (even cilantro haters, like myself)!  Love that you don't have to ask for water cups, and there's foil and paper bags to wrap your leftovers in.  Will definitely be back!"

You 100% have to get the green sauce to go with your pizza. It  enhances the flavor so well and makes it 10x better. If you don't use it you're doing it wrong. Can't wait to try the other pizzas of the day when I go back to visit."
786,"I absolutely love this pizza place. I might be a bit sentimental, but I've spent a lot of time with some of my best friends at Slivers. They give you a sliver of pizza every time you order a slice, or two slivers if you order a whole pizza. The first time I had it, I didn't even realize I was eating a vegetarian pizza! Everyday they have a different pizza, and they only serve one type of pizza a day. Super unique, and very efficient. If you like a bit of kick to your pizza, try their green sauce next to the water. It goes so well with any of their pizzas. If you want to find me in Berkeley, Slivers is where I'll be."
787,"3.5 round up / We came here bc the line for Cheeseboard intimidated us. Today's special had corn!!!!! Corn on  pizza is the best. The cilantro green sauce was also good. The line was really short but the service for the bar was quite slow. They check IDs for each beer *_* I'm old af. Below average beer selection. Good place for college or high school dates, lol.I don't actually understand the hype of this place and would only recommend if you are craving pizza in the area."
788,"I came here during memorial day on a recommendation that this is one of the best pizza places in Berkeley. It seems like any other pizza joint styles places with a good beer selection, tv, and pizza. At this point you don't have a menu, you have one pizza. We ordered the half pizza and got 2 slices for free. It seem pretty awesome to get some extra pizza. I enjoyed the ambiance of the pizza place ; Sports bar. Parking is tricky here in the sense that its street parking if you're lucky or the paid parking lot across the street. I came here for lunch when it just opened so it wasn't crowded but given that this is a college town I can see how crowded this gets. I loved the pizza. However I do like my freedom of choice and not being told what to eat. Though this is like a omakase style pizza joint, I'd prefer creating my own pizza place. But if I'm back in Berkeley I would hit up Sliver again or Cheeseboard.GO BEARS!"
789,"I came here on a weekday in the late afternoon to grab a single slice before getting on the Bart. Sliver only offers one flavor of pizza each day and the flavor changes every single day. When I went, the flavor was ""crimini mushrooms, yellow onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, fresh herbs, infused rosemary & chanterelle mushroom olive oil"".The slice comes with a small ""sliver"" on top, which is a nice bonus. The pizza was really oily, so I had to grab some napkins to blot off the oil. The pizza was quite aromatic because of the mushroom olive oil that they used, along with the actual mushrooms on top. The pizza was tasty and flavorful, but I personally didn't find it to be extraordinary and worth the $3.25 (including tax)."
790,"I heard a lot of great things about this place! I went on a Saturday before the lunch rush. I order the special pizza for the day. It had pineapple, arugula, mozzarella and something else. I was surprised when the pizza was tough and hard to bite into. I didn't think it tasted that good. The good thing was the pesto sauce they have on the side. I had to dip my pizza in that so it had some flavor! It could be just this day and the special they had. I see on the menu some of the other specials and it looks bomb. I would come back and try another pizza."
791,"One type of pizza everyday, $3.25 per slice plus you get a little extra sliver. Water dispenser. Delicious pesto sauce condiment. Great outdoor seating as well.Came here to grab a quick bite before a graduation ceremony and was glad to have a full belly."
792,"Sliver is a vegetarian pizza place that serves one type of tasty pizza a day. My favorite flavor so far is definitely the potato and corn, but the other types are also unique and delicious. Occasionally, there are also new unique combinations that feature ingredients like peaches or blue cheese (super interesting to try, you could always buy a slice to try and eat somewhere else closeby if you don't like it). I usually check online to see what flavors they're serving each day that week, since I definitely prefer some pizzas over others. Along with that, there's a green sauce that's a great addition to the the cheesy non-marinara pizzas. They also serve frescas now, which are refreshing and not overly sweet.It's probably important to note that this place is very similar to Cheeseboard, in pizza and concept. Though it's still a quick and affordable place (especially closer to campus) for some delicious pizza."
793,"Pizza here reminds me of their East Bay neighbors The Cheese Board, Arizmendi Bakery, and Nabolom Bakery. All of them are serving one type of vegetarian pizza daily and aiming to create a community around good food including pizza. Prices are more or less similar too.Like The Cheese Board and Nabolom, their green sauce is a must try. Spicy sauce fans forget red chili pepper flakes and grab a few containers of their sauce.What sets Sliver Pizzeria from the rest is the setting. It's a sports bar with a full bar inside, TVs with sports on, long community tables, happy hour specials, and live music Friday's and Saturday's. If you're not in the mood, you can always get it to go or sit outside.I personally prefer Nabolom and Arizmendi's crust, but the pizza here is still solid. Plus, you gotta love those extra baby slices with your pizza."
794,"Food 4/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Bang for your buck 4/5. A great place to catch the games and get some pizzas with high quality ingredients. Note this place only has vegetarian pizza and one flavor per day. Check on their website to see which flavor is showcased today! On any given day, Sliver can get pretty busy, and even busier on days when there is a game playing. However, the line usually moves pretty rapidly because pizzas are continuously being baked. But, you might have a hard time find seating. If it does happen don't worry, it it's a nice day out bring your pizza on the front lawn of UC Berkeley. The one thing that makes it special is they actually provide two slivers with your slice of whole pizza, and hence the name. A really good deal is actually getting a slice of pizza and a salad. All the flavors are really good with top notch ingredients but I usually avoid days where they have tomatoes as a topping, as it doesn't add much to the pizza. I usually go for days where the toppings either include potatoes, or mushrooms or corn (best days). My own trope is that their pizza can get pretty oily because of the cheese. However, the green sauce that you can scoop yourself is pretty amazing and helps tame the oils from the pizza. Overall, it's a solid place to get pizza. I only wished sometimes that they did a meat pizza but I guess you can't have it all. Tips - Its cheaper to get a full pizza for $20 and share it between friends! Pros - High quality ingredients and with only one flavor you don't have to decide which flavor you want! Cons - the pizza can get oily but the green sauce help mitigate that."
795,"Pizza is OK but kinda inconsistent.  We stayed at the restaurant for a couple of hours to watch a warrior game.  The first pizza was good while the second one too oily, had way too much cheese,  and was a little undercooked.   I do like the green sauce but do not like the fact that there is only one type of pizza per day.Happy hour is 3PM - 6PM, you get pizza slivers with your order of alcohol."
796,"Their pizza is very much worth the hype! Always vegetarian and made fresh daily, their changing daily menu makes it easy to go every day. Their website is updated with the menu schedule for the week, so make sure to check it before you go! Their crust itself is more of a flatbread style rather than a fluffy crust style, and is slightly greasier than I'd like, but not more than is expected of a typical pizza. Either way, their pairing of toppings is impeccable, and each one is a delight. My personal favorite is the corn pizza, which I like to drizzle some of their pesto and squeeze a hint of lime on. The only thing is the lines can get pretty crazy during peak times, but service is quick."
797,"My boyfriend took me here as a ""must-go"" staple in Berkeley and I didn't know what to expect! The pizza was SO good - albeit a bit oily, but it's pizza (what do you expect). I had no idea what I was eating (what toppings) because we went in, got 2 slices of pizza, was handed the pizza and then walked out to proceed with our Berkeley food tour. Apparently the pizza of the day was something with kalamata olives (which I thought were some sort of meat) but ALL THEIR PIZZAS ARE VEGETARIAN ! I hope this place continues to change people's perceptions of vegetarian pizzas being less flavorful, delicious or desirable because this pizza was definitely better than many of the meat-included pizzas I've had in my LIFETIME. Definitely worth the visit, prices are reasonable because you're in a college town, good quality, would 10/10 recommend."
798,"The green sauce!!! Sliver's green sauce is the main reason I want to eat here all the time.(For reference, I have never tried Cheese Board)Sliver changes their pizza toppings daily, so check their website before going in if you're a picky eater! My favorite pizzas are the ones topped with corn and mushrooms. Their pizzas are more like cheesy bread (think of a flatter version of the cheese bread at Sweet Tomatoes). They have a thin crust with a generous amount of cheese + a sparse sprinkle of toppings. Their sauce is the reason I keep coming back--it's tangy with a bit of heat. It's the perfect compliment to their cheesy pizza and would taste good on practically anything.For the price (a bit over $20 for a whole pizza or a few bucks for slice), I do wish that they'd be more generous with the toppings. Also, from a value perspective, not the most cost-efficient which is why I'm giving it 4-stars."
799,"I've been to Sliver Pizzeria over 5 times and I've never had a bad pizza.  Some pizzas are tastier than others though.  Check out Sliver's website to see the pizza of the day!  Sliver only sells one type of pizza each day and the pizza is always vegetarian!  Be sure to warn any meat lovers you may be taking to Sliver with you.  I didn't warn my Filipino meat-loving mom when I took her to Sliver and she was shocked that there weren't any meat pizzas available.  She said she was going to go to Top Dog nearby to get a hot dog to fill her need for meat. -__-  Anyway, when you eat the pizza at Sliver, be sure to put some of the free green sauce on it.  The pizza is not complete without the green sauce.  Also, if you plan to drink alcohol at Sliver, I do not recommend the sangria.  It just tasted like juice and there were no visible fruits in the drink...  It could've been better."
800,"Sliver, the place started by a few former Cheeseboard employees who said the hell with the collective and started serving alcohol, making it a great place to watch a game and have a drink. Won't be a stretch to say that they took a few things with them - mainly the concept of one type of vegetarian pizza daily and that amazing green sauce!The pizza is amazing. Yes, some days are better than others but this is subjective and depends on your pizza preferences. But what's better than an amazing pizza? Amazing pizza you can share with friends while drinking a cold one and watching the game. This is where the two concepts diverge. One is not better than the other, it just depends on what you prefer in the specific case. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Is it a bit overhyped? Sure, but it mostly delivers."
801,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE. It's so hard to chew that my jaw literally hurts so much I don't even want to eat anymore. It's like chewing on cardboard.I definitely DO NOT want to come back here and would rather eat some Dominos, Pizza Hut, pls anything else but this."
802,"I got Sliver delivered by Caviar. The whole pie was 24$ plus taxes $2 something and $4 something for service fee plus 2$ tip. So even though Delivery was free the total charge for whole pizza came out to 33$ for me. Not cheap at all. Probably won't get it delivered again. Today's pizza had potatoes, caramelized onions (according to the menu but I couldn't taste it at all), goat cheese, mozzarella and olive oil. The whole pie came with 2 slivers (1 extra slice) which was a nice touch. The pizza was good and cilantro sauce was yum. It's basically chutney (Indian sauce lol). Overall,Not the best pizza I've had by far but it was good. Definitely wasn't worth what I spent on it."
803,"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Since they've only got one kind of pizza a day the only decision you have to make is how much to order! Another positive to this method is that it's ready immediately - they've just got hot pizzas waiting to be plated.  Between my boyfriend and I, we split a half and I ended up taking home a slice.  Totally reasonable prices - the half was not much more than $12, and they were very generous.There were a lot of flies inside, but what can you expect for a sports bar?  This is a casual spot and clearly popular with all the cal students.  We ate in but will probably do take out next time because parking kind of sucks in the area.They've got an amazing cilantro sauce that goes on the pizza that I would recommend to anyone (even cilantro haters, like myself)!  Love that you don't have to ask for water cups, and there's foil and paper bags to wrap your leftovers in.  Will definitely be back!"
804,"TL;DR 1 AWESOME vegetarian pizza/dayWhat is Sliver:They serve 1 vegetarian pizza each day. Meat lovers: don't be afraid, it will be great, and it will satisfy you.PLUSES:+ location: DT Berkeley, next to BART station & Cal+ vegetarian!! + crust + toppings are awesome, their 1 flavor a day pizza has never disappointed+ check online to see what the toppings of the day are+ their long line can be intimidating, but goes by pretty fastDELTAS:- Not as good as Cheese....."
805,"Oh my god, the green sauce!!! That was the biggest game changer for this place. I first went here when I was visiting my boyfriend in Berkeley. I could eat pizza everyday and this was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas that I have tried. I'm so heartbroken that I don't live anywhere near here because this would for sure be my go to place. The way this place works is that they have one flavor that they serve a day and that's it. And while that may not seem appealing at first it's like a mini adventure to try something that you might not have ever thought of ordering before.

827,"3.5 round up / We came here bc the line for Cheeseboard intimidated us. Today's special had corn!!!!! Corn on  pizza is the best. The cilantro green sauce was also good. The line was really short but the service for the bar was quite slow. They check IDs for each beer *_* I'm old af. Below average beer selection. Good place for college or high school dates, lol.I don't actually understand the hype of this place and would only recommend if you are craving pizza in the area."
828,"I came here during memorial day on a recommendation that this is one of the best pizza places in Berkeley. It seems like any other pizza joint styles places with a good beer selection, tv, and pizza. At this point you don't have a menu, you have one pizza. We ordered the half pizza and got 2 slices for free. It seem pretty awesome to get some extra pizza. I enjoyed the ambiance of the pizza place ; Sports bar. Parking is tricky here in the sense that its street parking if you're lucky or the paid parking lot across the street. I came here for lunch when it just opened so it wasn't crowded but given that this is a college town I can see how crowded this gets. I loved the pizza. However I do like my freedom of choice and not being told what to eat. Though this is like a omakase style pizza joint, I'd prefer creating my own pizza place. But if I'm back in Berkeley I would hit up Sliver again or Cheeseboard.GO BEARS!"
829,"I came here on a weekday in the late afternoon to grab a single slice before getting on the Bart. Sliver only offers one flavor of pizza each day and the flavor changes every single day. When I went, the flavor was ""crimini mushrooms, yellow onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, fresh herbs, infused rosemary & chanterelle mushroom olive oil"".The slice comes with a small ""sliver"" on top, which is a nice bonus. The pizza was really oily, so I had to grab some napkins to blot off the oil. The pizza was quite aromatic because of the mushroom olive oil that they used, along with the actual mushrooms on top. The pizza was tasty and flavorful, but I personally didn't find it to be extraordinary and worth the $3.25 (including tax)."
830,"I heard a lot of great things about this place! I went on a Saturday before the lunch rush. I order the special pizza for the day. It had pineapple, arugula, mozzarella and something else. I was surprised when the pizza was tough and hard to bite into. I didn't think it tasted that good. The good thing was the pesto sauce they have on the side. I had to dip my pizza in that so it had some flavor! It could be just this day and the special they had. I see on the menu some of the other specials and it looks bomb. I would come back and try another pizza."
831,"One type of pizza everyday, $3.25 per slice plus you get a little extra sliver. Water dispenser. Delicious pesto sauce condiment. Great outdoor seating as well.Came here to grab a quick bite before a graduation ceremony and was glad to have a full belly."
832,"Sliver is a vegetarian pizza place that serves one type of tasty pizza a day. My favorite flavor so far is definitely the potato and corn, but the other types are also unique and delicious. Occasionally, there are also new unique combinations that feature ingredients like peaches or blue cheese (super interesting to try, you could always buy a slice to try and eat somewhere else closeby if you don't like it). I usually check online to see what flavors they're serving each day that week, since I definitely prefer some pizzas over others. Along with that, there's a green sauce that's a great addition to the the cheesy non-marinara pizzas. They also serve frescas now, which are refreshing and not overly sweet.It's probably important to note that this place is very similar to Cheeseboard, in pizza and concept. Though it's still a quick and affordable place (especially closer to campus) for some delicious pizza."
833,"Pizza here reminds me of their East Bay neighbors The Cheese Board, Arizmendi Bakery, and Nabolom Bakery. All of them are serving one type of vegetarian pizza daily and aiming to create a community around good food including pizza. Prices are more or less similar too.Like The Cheese Board and Nabolom, their green sauce is a must try. Spicy sauce fans forget red chili pepper flakes and grab a few containers of their sauce.What sets Sliver Pizzeria from the rest is the setting. It's a sports bar with a full bar inside, TVs with sports on, long community tables, happy hour specials, and live music Friday's and Saturday's. If you're not in the mood, you can always get it to go or sit outside.I personally prefer Nabolom and Arizmendi's crust, but the pizza here is still solid. Plus, you gotta love those extra baby slices with your pizza."
834,"Food 4/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Bang for your buck 4/5. A great place to catch the games and get some pizzas with high quality ingredients. Note this place only has vegetarian pizza and one flavor per day. Check on their website to see which flavor is showcased today! On any given day, Sliver can get pretty busy, and even busier on days when there is a game playing. However, the line usually moves pretty rapidly because pizzas are continuously being baked. But, you might have a hard time find seating. If it does happen don't worry, it it's a nice day out bring your pizza on the front lawn of UC Berkeley. The one thing that makes it special is they actually provide two slivers with your slice of whole pizza, and hence the name. A really good deal is actually getting a slice of pizza and a salad. All the flavors are really good with top notch ingredients but I usually avoid days where they have tomatoes as a topping, as it doesn't add much to the pizza. I usually go for days where the toppings either include potatoes, or mushrooms or corn (best days). My own trope is that their pizza can get pretty oily because of the cheese. However, the green sauce that you can scoop yourself is pretty amazing and helps tame the oils from the pizza. Overall, it's a solid place to get pizza. I only wished sometimes that they did a meat pizza but I guess you can't have it all. Tips - Its cheaper to get a full pizza for $20 and share it between friends! Pros - High quality ingredients and with only one flavor you don't have to decide which flavor you want! Cons - the pizza can get oily but the green sauce help mitigate that."
835,"Pizza is OK but kinda inconsistent.  We stayed at the restaurant for a couple of hours to watch a warrior game.  The first pizza was good while the second one too oily, had way too much cheese,  and was a little undercooked.   I do like the green sauce but do not like the fact that there is only one type of pizza per day.Happy hour is 3PM - 6PM, you get pizza slivers with your order of alcohol."
836,"Their pizza is very much worth the hype! Always vegetarian and made fresh daily, their changing daily menu makes it easy to go every day. Their website is updated with the menu schedule for the week, so make sure to check it before you go! Their crust itself is more of a flatbread style rather than a fluffy crust style, and is slightly greasier than I'd like, but not more than is expected of a typical pizza. Either way, their pairing of toppings is impeccable, and each one is a delight. My personal favorite is the corn pizza, which I like to drizzle some of their pesto and squeeze a hint of lime on. The only thing is the lines can get pretty crazy during peak times, but service is quick."
837,"My boyfriend took me here as a ""must-go"" staple in Berkeley and I didn't know what to expect! The pizza was SO good - albeit a bit oily, but it's pizza (what do you expect). I had no idea what I was eating (what toppings) because we went in, got 2 slices of pizza, was handed the pizza and then walked out to proceed with our Berkeley food tour. Apparently the pizza of the day was something with kalamata olives (which I thought were some sort of meat) but ALL THEIR PIZZAS ARE VEGETARIAN ! I hope this place continues to change people's perceptions of vegetarian pizzas being less flavorful, delicious or desirable because this pizza was definitely better than many of the meat-included pizzas I've had in my LIFETIME. Definitely worth the visit, prices are reasonable because you're in a college town, good quality, would 10/10 recommend."
838,"The green sauce!!! Sliver's green sauce is the main reason I want to eat here all the time.(For reference, I have never tried Cheese Board)Sliver changes their pizza toppings daily, so check their website before going in if you're a picky eater! My favorite pizzas are the ones topped with corn and mushrooms. Their pizzas are more like cheesy bread (think of a flatter version of the cheese bread at Sweet Tomatoes). They have a thin crust with a generous amount of cheese + a sparse sprinkle of toppings. Their sauce is the reason I keep coming back--it's tangy with a bit of heat. It's the perfect compliment to their cheesy pizza and would taste good on practically anything.For the price (a bit over $20 for a whole pizza or a few bucks for slice), I do wish that they'd be more generous with the toppings. Also, from a value perspective, not the most cost-efficient which is why I'm giving it 4-stars."
839,"I've been to Sliver Pizzeria over 5 times and I've never had a bad pizza.  Some pizzas are tastier than others though.  Check out Sliver's website to see the pizza of the day!  Sliver only sells one type of pizza each day and the pizza is always vegetarian!  Be sure to warn any meat lovers you may be taking to Sliver with you.  I didn't warn my Filipino meat-loving mom when I took her to Sliver and she was shocked that there weren't any meat pizzas available.  She said she was going to go to Top Dog nearby to get a hot dog to fill her need for meat. -__-  Anyway, when you eat the pizza at Sliver, be sure to put some of the free green sauce on it.  The pizza is not complete without the green sauce.  Also, if you plan to drink alcohol at Sliver, I do not recommend the sangria.  It just tasted like juice and there were no visible fruits in the drink...  It could've been better."
840,"Sliver, the place started by a few former Cheeseboard employees who said the hell with the collective and started serving alcohol, making it a great place to watch a game and have a drink. Won't be a stretch to say that they took a few things with them - mainly the concept of one type of vegetarian pizza daily and that amazing green sauce!The pizza is amazing. Yes, some days are better than others but this is subjective and depends on your pizza preferences. But what's better than an amazing pizza? Amazing pizza you can share with friends while drinking a cold one and watching the game. This is where the two concepts diverge. One is not better than the other, it just depends on what you prefer in the specific case. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Is it a bit overhyped? Sure, but it mostly delivers."
841,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE. It's so hard to chew that my jaw literally hurts so much I don't even want to eat anymore. It's like chewing on cardboard.I definitely DO NOT want to come back here and would rather eat some Dominos, Pizza Hut, pls anything else but this."
842,"I got Sliver delivered by Caviar. The whole pie was 24$ plus taxes $2 something and $4 something for service fee plus 2$ tip. So even though Delivery was free the total charge for whole pizza came out to 33$ for me. Not cheap at all. Probably won't get it delivered again. Today's pizza had potatoes, caramelized onions (according to the menu but I couldn't taste it at all), goat cheese, mozzarella and olive oil. The whole pie came with 2 slivers (1 extra slice) which was a nice touch. The pizza was good and cilantro sauce was yum. It's basically chutney (Indian sauce lol). Overall,Not the best pizza I've had by far but it was good. Definitely wasn't worth what I spent on it."
843,"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Since they've only got one kind of pizza a day the only decision you have to make is how much to order! Another positive to this method is that it's ready immediately - they've just got hot pizzas waiting to be plated.  Between my boyfriend and I, we split a half and I ended up taking home a slice.  Totally reasonable prices - the half was not much more than $12, and they were very generous.There were a lot of flies inside, but what can you expect for a sports bar?  This is a casual spot and clearly popular with all the cal students.  We ate in but will probably do take out next time because parking kind of sucks in the area.They've got an amazing cilantro sauce that goes on the pizza that I would recommend to anyone (even cilantro haters, like myself)!  Love that you don't have to ask for water cups, and there's foil and paper bags to wrap your leftovers in.  Will definitely be back!"
844,"TL;DR 1 AWESOME vegetarian pizza/dayWhat is Sliver:They serve 1 vegetarian pizza each day. Meat lovers: don't be afraid, it will be great, and it will satisfy you.PLUSES:+ location: DT Berkeley, next to BART station & Cal+ vegetarian!! + crust + toppings are awesome, their 1 flavor a day pizza has never disappointed+ check online to see what the toppings of the day are+ their long line can be intimidating, but goes by pretty fastDELTAS:- Not as good as Cheese....."
845,"Oh my god, the green sauce!!! That was the biggest game changer for this place. I first went here when I was visiting my boyfriend in Berkeley. I could eat pizza everyday and this was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas that I have tried. I'm so heartbroken that I don't live anywhere near here because this would for sure be my go to place. The way this place works is that they have one flavor that they serve a day and that's it. And while that may not seem appealing at first it's like a mini adventure to try something that you might not have ever thought of ordering before. Every time I walked by this place it seemed like it was completely packed and every table was taken so that already is a pretty good sign that you're in for something good.About half of a full pizza was about $12 and even sharing that with two people was more than enough especially with the extra slivers that you get on top.I went here on a Thursday so when I went the pizza of the day was the roasted Yukon gold potato pizza. When I first heard that they were gonna be putting potatoes on my pizza I was a little hesitant but after taking one bite I was completely sold. You 100% have to get the green sauce to go with your pizza. It  enhances the flavor so well and makes it 10x better. If you don't use it you're doing it wrong. Can't wait to try the other pizzas of the day when I go back to visit."
846,"I absolutely love this pizza place. I might be a bit sentimental, but I've spent a lot of time with some of my best friends at Slivers.

However I do like my freedom of choice and not being told what to eat. Though this is like a omakase style pizza joint, I'd prefer creating my own pizza place. But if I'm back in Berkeley I would hit up Sliver again or Cheeseboard.GO BEARS!"
869,"I came here on a weekday in the late afternoon to grab a single slice before getting on the Bart. Sliver only offers one flavor of pizza each day and the flavor changes every single day. When I went, the flavor was ""crimini mushrooms, yellow onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, fresh herbs, infused rosemary & chanterelle mushroom olive oil"".The slice comes with a small ""sliver"" on top, which is a nice bonus. The pizza was really oily, so I had to grab some napkins to blot off the oil. The pizza was quite aromatic because of the mushroom olive oil that they used, along with the actual mushrooms on top. The pizza was tasty and flavorful, but I personally didn't find it to be extraordinary and worth the $3.25 (including tax)."
870,"I heard a lot of great things about this place! I went on a Saturday before the lunch rush. I order the special pizza for the day. It had pineapple, arugula, mozzarella and something else. I was surprised when the pizza was tough and hard to bite into. I didn't think it tasted that good. The good thing was the pesto sauce they have on the side. I had to dip my pizza in that so it had some flavor! It could be just this day and the special they had. I see on the menu some of the other specials and it looks bomb. I would come back and try another pizza."
871,"One type of pizza everyday, $3.25 per slice plus you get a little extra sliver. Water dispenser. Delicious pesto sauce condiment. Great outdoor seating as well.Came here to grab a quick bite before a graduation ceremony and was glad to have a full belly."
872,"Sliver is a vegetarian pizza place that serves one type of tasty pizza a day. My favorite flavor so far is definitely the potato and corn, but the other types are also unique and delicious. Occasionally, there are also new unique combinations that feature ingredients like peaches or blue cheese (super interesting to try, you could always buy a slice to try and eat somewhere else closeby if you don't like it). I usually check online to see what flavors they're serving each day that week, since I definitely prefer some pizzas over others. Along with that, there's a green sauce that's a great addition to the the cheesy non-marinara pizzas. They also serve frescas now, which are refreshing and not overly sweet.It's probably important to note that this place is very similar to Cheeseboard, in pizza and concept. Though it's still a quick and affordable place (especially closer to campus) for some delicious pizza."
873,"Pizza here reminds me of their East Bay neighbors The Cheese Board, Arizmendi Bakery, and Nabolom Bakery. All of them are serving one type of vegetarian pizza daily and aiming to create a community around good food including pizza. Prices are more or less similar too.Like The Cheese Board and Nabolom, their green sauce is a must try. Spicy sauce fans forget red chili pepper flakes and grab a few containers of their sauce.What sets Sliver Pizzeria from the rest is the setting. It's a sports bar with a full bar inside, TVs with sports on, long community tables, happy hour specials, and live music Friday's and Saturday's. If you're not in the mood, you can always get it to go or sit outside.I personally prefer Nabolom and Arizmendi's crust, but the pizza here is still solid. Plus, you gotta love those extra baby slices with your pizza."
874,"Food 4/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Bang for your buck 4/5. A great place to catch the games and get some pizzas with high quality ingredients. Note this place only has vegetarian pizza and one flavor per day. Check on their website to see which flavor is showcased today! On any given day, Sliver can get pretty busy, and even busier on days when there is a game playing. However, the line usually moves pretty rapidly because pizzas are continuously being baked. But, you might have a hard time find seating. If it does happen don't worry, it it's a nice day out bring your pizza on the front lawn of UC Berkeley. The one thing that makes it special is they actually provide two slivers with your slice of whole pizza, and hence the name. A really good deal is actually getting a slice of pizza and a salad. All the flavors are really good with top notch ingredients but I usually avoid days where they have tomatoes as a topping, as it doesn't add much to the pizza. I usually go for days where the toppings either include potatoes, or mushrooms or corn (best days). My own trope is that their pizza can get pretty oily because of the cheese. However, the green sauce that you can scoop yourself is pretty amazing and helps tame the oils from the pizza. Overall, it's a solid place to get pizza. I only wished sometimes that they did a meat pizza but I guess you can't have it all. Tips - Its cheaper to get a full pizza for $20 and share it between friends! Pros - High quality ingredients and with only one flavor you don't have to decide which flavor you want! Cons - the pizza can get oily but the green sauce help mitigate that."
875,"Pizza is OK but kinda inconsistent.  We stayed at the restaurant for a couple of hours to watch a warrior game.  The first pizza was good while the second one too oily, had way too much cheese,  and was a little undercooked.   I do like the green sauce but do not like the fact that there is only one type of pizza per day.Happy hour is 3PM - 6PM, you get pizza slivers with your order of alcohol."
876,"Their pizza is very much worth the hype! Always vegetarian and made fresh daily, their changing daily menu makes it easy to go every day. Their website is updated with the menu schedule for the week, so make sure to check it before you go! Their crust itself is more of a flatbread style rather than a fluffy crust style, and is slightly greasier than I'd like, but not more than is expected of a typical pizza. Either way, their pairing of toppings is impeccable, and each one is a delight. My personal favorite is the corn pizza, which I like to drizzle some of their pesto and squeeze a hint of lime on. The only thing is the lines can get pretty crazy during peak times, but service is quick."
877,"My boyfriend took me here as a ""must-go"" staple in Berkeley and I didn't know what to expect! The pizza was SO good - albeit a bit oily, but it's pizza (what do you expect). I had no idea what I was eating (what toppings) because we went in, got 2 slices of pizza, was handed the pizza and then walked out to proceed with our Berkeley food tour. Apparently the pizza of the day was something with kalamata olives (which I thought were some sort of meat) but ALL THEIR PIZZAS ARE VEGETARIAN ! I hope this place continues to change people's perceptions of vegetarian pizzas being less flavorful, delicious or desirable because this pizza was definitely better than many of the meat-included pizzas I've had in my LIFETIME. Definitely worth the visit, prices are reasonable because you're in a college town, good quality, would 10/10 recommend."
878,"The green sauce!!! Sliver's green sauce is the main reason I want to eat here all the time.(For reference, I have never tried Cheese Board)Sliver changes their pizza toppings daily, so check their website before going in if you're a picky eater! My favorite pizzas are the ones topped with corn and mushrooms. Their pizzas are more like cheesy bread (think of a flatter version of the cheese bread at Sweet Tomatoes). They have a thin crust with a generous amount of cheese + a sparse sprinkle of toppings. Their sauce is the reason I keep coming back--it's tangy with a bit of heat. It's the perfect compliment to their cheesy pizza and would taste good on practically anything.For the price (a bit over $20 for a whole pizza or a few bucks for slice), I do wish that they'd be more generous with the toppings. Also, from a value perspective, not the most cost-efficient which is why I'm giving it 4-stars."
879,"I've been to Sliver Pizzeria over 5 times and I've never had a bad pizza.  Some pizzas are tastier than others though.  Check out Sliver's website to see the pizza of the day!  Sliver only sells one type of pizza each day and the pizza is always vegetarian!  Be sure to warn any meat lovers you may be taking to Sliver with you.  I didn't warn my Filipino meat-loving mom when I took her to Sliver and she was shocked that there weren't any meat pizzas available.  She said she was going to go to Top Dog nearby to get a hot dog to fill her need for meat. -__-  Anyway, when you eat the pizza at Sliver, be sure to put some of the free green sauce on it.  The pizza is not complete without the green sauce.  Also, if you plan to drink alcohol at Sliver, I do not recommend the sangria.  It just tasted like juice and there were no visible fruits in the drink...  It could've been better."
880,"Sliver, the place started by a few former Cheeseboard employees who said the hell with the collective and started serving alcohol, making it a great place to watch a game and have a drink. Won't be a stretch to say that they took a few things with them - mainly the concept of one type of vegetarian pizza daily and that amazing green sauce!The pizza is amazing. Yes, some days are better than others but this is subjective and depends on your pizza preferences. But what's better than an amazing pizza? Amazing pizza you can share with friends while drinking a cold one and watching the game. This is where the two concepts diverge. One is not better than the other, it just depends on what you prefer in the specific case. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Is it a bit overhyped? Sure, but it mostly delivers."
881,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE. It's so hard to chew that my jaw literally hurts so much I don't even want to eat anymore. It's like chewing on cardboard.I definitely DO NOT want to come back here and would rather eat some Dominos, Pizza Hut, pls anything else but this."
882,"I got Sliver delivered by Caviar. The whole pie was 24$ plus taxes $2 something and $4 something for service fee plus 2$ tip. So even though Delivery was free the total charge for whole pizza came out to 33$ for me. Not cheap at all. Probably won't get it delivered again. Today's pizza had potatoes, caramelized onions (according to the menu but I couldn't taste it at all), goat cheese, mozzarella and olive oil. The whole pie came with 2 slivers (1 extra slice) which was a nice touch. The pizza was good and cilantro sauce was yum. It's basically chutney (Indian sauce lol). Overall,Not the best pizza I've had by far but it was good. Definitely wasn't worth what I spent on it."
883,"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Since they've only got one kind of pizza a day the only decision you have to make is how much to order! Another positive to this method is that it's ready immediately - they've just got hot pizzas waiting to be plated.  Between my boyfriend and I, we split a half and I ended up taking home a slice.  Totally reasonable prices - the half was not much more than $12, and they were very generous.There were a lot of flies inside, but what can you expect for a sports bar?  This is a casual spot and clearly popular with all the cal students.  We ate in but will probably do take out next time because parking kind of sucks in the area.They've got an amazing cilantro sauce that goes on the pizza that I would recommend to anyone (even cilantro haters, like myself)!  Love that you don't have to ask for water cups, and there's foil and paper bags to wrap your leftovers in.  Will definitely be back!"
884,"TL;DR 1 AWESOME vegetarian pizza/dayWhat is Sliver:They serve 1 vegetarian pizza each day. Meat lovers: don't be afraid, it will be great, and it will satisfy you.PLUSES:+ location: DT Berkeley, next to BART station & Cal+ vegetarian!! + crust + toppings are awesome, their 1 flavor a day pizza has never disappointed+ check online to see what the toppings of the day are+ their long line can be intimidating, but goes by pretty fastDELTAS:- Not as good as Cheese....."
885,"Oh my god, the green sauce!!! That was the biggest game changer for this place. I first went here when I was visiting my boyfriend in Berkeley. I could eat pizza everyday and this was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas that I have tried. I'm so heartbroken that I don't live anywhere near here because this would for sure be my go to place. The way this place works is that they have one flavor that they serve a day and that's it. And while that may not seem appealing at first it's like a mini adventure to try something that you might not have ever thought of ordering before. Every time I walked by this place it seemed like it was completely packed and every table was taken so that already is a pretty good sign that you're in for something good.About half of a full pizza was about $12 and even sharing that with two people was more than enough especially with the extra slivers that you get on top.I went here on a Thursday so when I went the pizza of the day was the roasted Yukon gold potato pizza. When I first heard that they were gonna be putting potatoes on my pizza I was a little hesitant but after taking one bite I was completely sold. You 100% have to get the green sauce to go with your pizza. It  enhances the flavor so well and makes it 10x better. If you don't use it you're doing it wrong. Can't wait to try the other pizzas of the day when I go back to visit."
886,"I absolutely love this pizza place. I might be a bit sentimental, but I've spent a lot of time with some of my best friends at Slivers. They give you a sliver of pizza every time you order a slice, or two slivers if you order a whole pizza. The first time I had it, I didn't even realize I was eating a vegetarian pizza! Everyday they have a different pizza, and they only serve one type of pizza a day. Super unique, and very efficient. If you like a bit of kick to your pizza, try their green sauce next to the water. It goes so well with any of their pizzas. If you want to find me in Berkeley, Slivers is where I'll be."
887,"3.5 round up / We came here bc the line for Cheeseboard intimidated us. Today's special had corn!!!!! Corn on  pizza is the best. The cilantro green sauce was also good. The line was really short but the service for the bar was quite slow. They check IDs for each beer *_* I'm old af. Below average beer selection. Good place for college or high school dates, lol.I don't actually understand the hype of this place and would only recommend if you are craving pizza in the area."
888,"I came here during memorial day on a recommendation that this is one of the best pizza places in Berkeley. It seems like any other pizza joint styles places with a good beer selection, tv, and pizza. At this point you don't have a menu, you have one pizza. We ordered the half pizza and got 2 slices for free. It seem pretty awesome to get some extra pizza. I enjoyed the ambiance of the pizza place ; Sports bar.

I had to dip my pizza in that so it had some flavor! It could be just this day and the special they had. I see on the menu some of the other specials and it looks bomb. I would come back and try another pizza."
911,"One type of pizza everyday, $3.25 per slice plus you get a little extra sliver. Water dispenser. Delicious pesto sauce condiment. Great outdoor seating as well.Came here to grab a quick bite before a graduation ceremony and was glad to have a full belly."
912,"Sliver is a vegetarian pizza place that serves one type of tasty pizza a day. My favorite flavor so far is definitely the potato and corn, but the other types are also unique and delicious. Occasionally, there are also new unique combinations that feature ingredients like peaches or blue cheese (super interesting to try, you could always buy a slice to try and eat somewhere else closeby if you don't like it). I usually check online to see what flavors they're serving each day that week, since I definitely prefer some pizzas over others. Along with that, there's a green sauce that's a great addition to the the cheesy non-marinara pizzas. They also serve frescas now, which are refreshing and not overly sweet.It's probably important to note that this place is very similar to Cheeseboard, in pizza and concept. Though it's still a quick and affordable place (especially closer to campus) for some delicious pizza."
913,"Pizza here reminds me of their East Bay neighbors The Cheese Board, Arizmendi Bakery, and Nabolom Bakery. All of them are serving one type of vegetarian pizza daily and aiming to create a community around good food including pizza. Prices are more or less similar too.Like The Cheese Board and Nabolom, their green sauce is a must try. Spicy sauce fans forget red chili pepper flakes and grab a few containers of their sauce.What sets Sliver Pizzeria from the rest is the setting. It's a sports bar with a full bar inside, TVs with sports on, long community tables, happy hour specials, and live music Friday's and Saturday's. If you're not in the mood, you can always get it to go or sit outside.I personally prefer Nabolom and Arizmendi's crust, but the pizza here is still solid. Plus, you gotta love those extra baby slices with your pizza."
914,"Food 4/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Bang for your buck 4/5. A great place to catch the games and get some pizzas with high quality ingredients. Note this place only has vegetarian pizza and one flavor per day. Check on their website to see which flavor is showcased today! On any given day, Sliver can get pretty busy, and even busier on days when there is a game playing. However, the line usually moves pretty rapidly because pizzas are continuously being baked. But, you might have a hard time find seating. If it does happen don't worry, it it's a nice day out bring your pizza on the front lawn of UC Berkeley. The one thing that makes it special is they actually provide two slivers with your slice of whole pizza, and hence the name. A really good deal is actually getting a slice of pizza and a salad. All the flavors are really good with top notch ingredients but I usually avoid days where they have tomatoes as a topping, as it doesn't add much to the pizza. I usually go for days where the toppings either include potatoes, or mushrooms or corn (best days). My own trope is that their pizza can get pretty oily because of the cheese. However, the green sauce that you can scoop yourself is pretty amazing and helps tame the oils from the pizza. Overall, it's a solid place to get pizza. I only wished sometimes that they did a meat pizza but I guess you can't have it all. Tips - Its cheaper to get a full pizza for $20 and share it between friends! Pros - High quality ingredients and with only one flavor you don't have to decide which flavor you want! Cons - the pizza can get oily but the green sauce help mitigate that."
915,"Pizza is OK but kinda inconsistent.  We stayed at the restaurant for a couple of hours to watch a warrior game.  The first pizza was good while the second one too oily, had way too much cheese,  and was a little undercooked.   I do like the green sauce but do not like the fact that there is only one type of pizza per day.Happy hour is 3PM - 6PM, you get pizza slivers with your order of alcohol."
916,"Their pizza is very much worth the hype! Always vegetarian and made fresh daily, their changing daily menu makes it easy to go every day. Their website is updated with the menu schedule for the week, so make sure to check it before you go! Their crust itself is more of a flatbread style rather than a fluffy crust style, and is slightly greasier than I'd like, but not more than is expected of a typical pizza. Either way, their pairing of toppings is impeccable, and each one is a delight. My personal favorite is the corn pizza, which I like to drizzle some of their pesto and squeeze a hint of lime on. The only thing is the lines can get pretty crazy during peak times, but service is quick."
917,"My boyfriend took me here as a ""must-go"" staple in Berkeley and I didn't know what to expect! The pizza was SO good - albeit a bit oily, but it's pizza (what do you expect). I had no idea what I was eating (what toppings) because we went in, got 2 slices of pizza, was handed the pizza and then walked out to proceed with our Berkeley food tour. Apparently the pizza of the day was something with kalamata olives (which I thought were some sort of meat) but ALL THEIR PIZZAS ARE VEGETARIAN ! I hope this place continues to change people's perceptions of vegetarian pizzas being less flavorful, delicious or desirable because this pizza was definitely better than many of the meat-included pizzas I've had in my LIFETIME. Definitely worth the visit, prices are reasonable because you're in a college town, good quality, would 10/10 recommend."
918,"The green sauce!!! Sliver's green sauce is the main reason I want to eat here all the time.(For reference, I have never tried Cheese Board)Sliver changes their pizza toppings daily, so check their website before going in if you're a picky eater! My favorite pizzas are the ones topped with corn and mushrooms. Their pizzas are more like cheesy bread (think of a flatter version of the cheese bread at Sweet Tomatoes). They have a thin crust with a generous amount of cheese + a sparse sprinkle of toppings. Their sauce is the reason I keep coming back--it's tangy with a bit of heat. It's the perfect compliment to their cheesy pizza and would taste good on practically anything.For the price (a bit over $20 for a whole pizza or a few bucks for slice), I do wish that they'd be more generous with the toppings. Also, from a value perspective, not the most cost-efficient which is why I'm giving it 4-stars."
919,"I've been to Sliver Pizzeria over 5 times and I've never had a bad pizza.  Some pizzas are tastier than others though.  Check out Sliver's website to see the pizza of the day!  Sliver only sells one type of pizza each day and the pizza is always vegetarian!  Be sure to warn any meat lovers you may be taking to Sliver with you.  I didn't warn my Filipino meat-loving mom when I took her to Sliver and she was shocked that there weren't any meat pizzas available.  She said she was going to go to Top Dog nearby to get a hot dog to fill her need for meat. -__-  Anyway, when you eat the pizza at Sliver, be sure to put some of the free green sauce on it.  The pizza is not complete without the green sauce.  Also, if you plan to drink alcohol at Sliver, I do not recommend the sangria.  It just tasted like juice and there were no visible fruits in the drink...  It could've been better."
920,"Sliver, the place started by a few former Cheeseboard employees who said the hell with the collective and started serving alcohol, making it a great place to watch a game and have a drink. Won't be a stretch to say that they took a few things with them - mainly the concept of one type of vegetarian pizza daily and that amazing green sauce!The pizza is amazing. Yes, some days are better than others but this is subjective and depends on your pizza preferences. But what's better than an amazing pizza? Amazing pizza you can share with friends while drinking a cold one and watching the game. This is where the two concepts diverge. One is not better than the other, it just depends on what you prefer in the specific case. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Is it a bit overhyped? Sure, but it mostly delivers."
921,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE. It's so hard to chew that my jaw literally hurts so much I don't even want to eat anymore. It's like chewing on cardboard.I definitely DO NOT want to come back here and would rather eat some Dominos, Pizza Hut, pls anything else but this."
922,"I got Sliver delivered by Caviar. The whole pie was 24$ plus taxes $2 something and $4 something for service fee plus 2$ tip. So even though Delivery was free the total charge for whole pizza came out to 33$ for me. Not cheap at all. Probably won't get it delivered again. Today's pizza had potatoes, caramelized onions (according to the menu but I couldn't taste it at all), goat cheese, mozzarella and olive oil. The whole pie came with 2 slivers (1 extra slice) which was a nice touch. The pizza was good and cilantro sauce was yum. It's basically chutney (Indian sauce lol). Overall,Not the best pizza I've had by far but it was good. Definitely wasn't worth what I spent on it."
923,"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Since they've only got one kind of pizza a day the only decision you have to make is how much to order! Another positive to this method is that it's ready immediately - they've just got hot pizzas waiting to be plated.  Between my boyfriend and I, we split a half and I ended up taking home a slice.  Totally reasonable prices - the half was not much more than $12, and they were very generous.There were a lot of flies inside, but what can you expect for a sports bar?  This is a casual spot and clearly popular with all the cal students.  We ate in but will probably do take out next time because parking kind of sucks in the area.They've got an amazing cilantro sauce that goes on the pizza that I would recommend to anyone (even cilantro haters, like myself)!  Love that you don't have to ask for water cups, and there's foil and paper bags to wrap your leftovers in.  Will definitely be back!"
924,"TL;DR 1 AWESOME vegetarian pizza/dayWhat is Sliver:They serve 1 vegetarian pizza each day. Meat lovers: don't be afraid, it will be great, and it will satisfy you.PLUSES:+ location: DT Berkeley, next to BART station & Cal+ vegetarian!! + crust + toppings are awesome, their 1 flavor a day pizza has never disappointed+ check online to see what the toppings of the day are+ their long line can be intimidating, but goes by pretty fastDELTAS:- Not as good as Cheese....."
925,"Oh my god, the green sauce!!! That was the biggest game changer for this place. I first went here when I was visiting my boyfriend in Berkeley. I could eat pizza everyday and this was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas that I have tried. I'm so heartbroken that I don't live anywhere near here because this would for sure be my go to place. The way this place works is that they have one flavor that they serve a day and that's it. And while that may not seem appealing at first it's like a mini adventure to try something that you might not have ever thought of ordering before. Every time I walked by this place it seemed like it was completely packed and every table was taken so that already is a pretty good sign that you're in for something good.About half of a full pizza was about $12 and even sharing that with two people was more than enough especially with the extra slivers that you get on top.I went here on a Thursday so when I went the pizza of the day was the roasted Yukon gold potato pizza. When I first heard that they were gonna be putting potatoes on my pizza I was a little hesitant but after taking one bite I was completely sold. You 100% have to get the green sauce to go with your pizza. It  enhances the flavor so well and makes it 10x better. If you don't use it you're doing it wrong. Can't wait to try the other pizzas of the day when I go back to visit."
926,"I absolutely love this pizza place. I might be a bit sentimental, but I've spent a lot of time with some of my best friends at Slivers. They give you a sliver of pizza every time you order a slice, or two slivers if you order a whole pizza. The first time I had it, I didn't even realize I was eating a vegetarian pizza! Everyday they have a different pizza, and they only serve one type of pizza a day. Super unique, and very efficient. If you like a bit of kick to your pizza, try their green sauce next to the water. It goes so well with any of their pizzas. If you want to find me in Berkeley, Slivers is where I'll be."
927,"3.5 round up / We came here bc the line for Cheeseboard intimidated us. Today's special had corn!!!!! Corn on  pizza is the best. The cilantro green sauce was also good. The line was really short but the service for the bar was quite slow. They check IDs for each beer *_* I'm old af. Below average beer selection. Good place for college or high school dates, lol.I don't actually understand the hype of this place and would only recommend if you are craving pizza in the area."
928,"I came here during memorial day on a recommendation that this is one of the best pizza places in Berkeley. It seems like any other pizza joint styles places with a good beer selection, tv, and pizza. At this point you don't have a menu, you have one pizza. We ordered the half pizza and got 2 slices for free. It seem pretty awesome to get some extra pizza. I enjoyed the ambiance of the pizza place ; Sports bar. Parking is tricky here in the sense that its street parking if you're lucky or the paid parking lot across the street. I came here for lunch when it just opened so it wasn't crowded but given that this is a college town I can see how crowded this gets. I loved the pizza. However I do like my freedom of choice and not being told what to eat. Though this is like a omakase style pizza joint, I'd prefer creating my own pizza place. But if I'm back in Berkeley I would hit up Sliver again or Cheeseboard.GO BEARS!"
929,"I came here on a weekday in the late afternoon to grab a single slice before getting on the Bart. Sliver only offers one flavor of pizza each day and the flavor changes every single day. When I went, the flavor was ""crimini mushrooms, yellow onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, fresh herbs, infused rosemary & chanterelle mushroom olive oil"".The slice comes with a small ""sliver"" on top, which is a nice bonus. The pizza was really oily, so I had to grab some napkins to blot off the oil. The pizza was quite aromatic because of the mushroom olive oil that they used, along with the actual mushrooms on top. The pizza was tasty and flavorful, but I personally didn't find it to be extraordinary and worth the $3.25 (including tax)."

Though it's still a quick and affordable place (especially closer to campus) for some delicious pizza."
953,"Pizza here reminds me of their East Bay neighbors The Cheese Board, Arizmendi Bakery, and Nabolom Bakery. All of them are serving one type of vegetarian pizza daily and aiming to create a community around good food including pizza. Prices are more or less similar too.Like The Cheese Board and Nabolom, their green sauce is a must try. Spicy sauce fans forget red chili pepper flakes and grab a few containers of their sauce.What sets Sliver Pizzeria from the rest is the setting. It's a sports bar with a full bar inside, TVs with sports on, long community tables, happy hour specials, and live music Friday's and Saturday's. If you're not in the mood, you can always get it to go or sit outside.I personally prefer Nabolom and Arizmendi's crust, but the pizza here is still solid. Plus, you gotta love those extra baby slices with your pizza."
954,"Food 4/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Bang for your buck 4/5. A great place to catch the games and get some pizzas with high quality ingredients. Note this place only has vegetarian pizza and one flavor per day. Check on their website to see which flavor is showcased today! On any given day, Sliver can get pretty busy, and even busier on days when there is a game playing. However, the line usually moves pretty rapidly because pizzas are continuously being baked. But, you might have a hard time find seating. If it does happen don't worry, it it's a nice day out bring your pizza on the front lawn of UC Berkeley. The one thing that makes it special is they actually provide two slivers with your slice of whole pizza, and hence the name. A really good deal is actually getting a slice of pizza and a salad. All the flavors are really good with top notch ingredients but I usually avoid days where they have tomatoes as a topping, as it doesn't add much to the pizza. I usually go for days where the toppings either include potatoes, or mushrooms or corn (best days). My own trope is that their pizza can get pretty oily because of the cheese. However, the green sauce that you can scoop yourself is pretty amazing and helps tame the oils from the pizza. Overall, it's a solid place to get pizza. I only wished sometimes that they did a meat pizza but I guess you can't have it all. Tips - Its cheaper to get a full pizza for $20 and share it between friends! Pros - High quality ingredients and with only one flavor you don't have to decide which flavor you want! Cons - the pizza can get oily but the green sauce help mitigate that."
955,"Pizza is OK but kinda inconsistent.  We stayed at the restaurant for a couple of hours to watch a warrior game.  The first pizza was good while the second one too oily, had way too much cheese,  and was a little undercooked.   I do like the green sauce but do not like the fact that there is only one type of pizza per day.Happy hour is 3PM - 6PM, you get pizza slivers with your order of alcohol."
956,"Their pizza is very much worth the hype! Always vegetarian and made fresh daily, their changing daily menu makes it easy to go every day. Their website is updated with the menu schedule for the week, so make sure to check it before you go! Their crust itself is more of a flatbread style rather than a fluffy crust style, and is slightly greasier than I'd like, but not more than is expected of a typical pizza. Either way, their pairing of toppings is impeccable, and each one is a delight. My personal favorite is the corn pizza, which I like to drizzle some of their pesto and squeeze a hint of lime on. The only thing is the lines can get pretty crazy during peak times, but service is quick."
957,"My boyfriend took me here as a ""must-go"" staple in Berkeley and I didn't know what to expect! The pizza was SO good - albeit a bit oily, but it's pizza (what do you expect). I had no idea what I was eating (what toppings) because we went in, got 2 slices of pizza, was handed the pizza and then walked out to proceed with our Berkeley food tour. Apparently the pizza of the day was something with kalamata olives (which I thought were some sort of meat) but ALL THEIR PIZZAS ARE VEGETARIAN ! I hope this place continues to change people's perceptions of vegetarian pizzas being less flavorful, delicious or desirable because this pizza was definitely better than many of the meat-included pizzas I've had in my LIFETIME. Definitely worth the visit, prices are reasonable because you're in a college town, good quality, would 10/10 recommend."
958,"The green sauce!!! Sliver's green sauce is the main reason I want to eat here all the time.(For reference, I have never tried Cheese Board)Sliver changes their pizza toppings daily, so check their website before going in if you're a picky eater! My favorite pizzas are the ones topped with corn and mushrooms. Their pizzas are more like cheesy bread (think of a flatter version of the cheese bread at Sweet Tomatoes). They have a thin crust with a generous amount of cheese + a sparse sprinkle of toppings. Their sauce is the reason I keep coming back--it's tangy with a bit of heat. It's the perfect compliment to their cheesy pizza and would taste good on practically anything.For the price (a bit over $20 for a whole pizza or a few bucks for slice), I do wish that they'd be more generous with the toppings. Also, from a value perspective, not the most cost-efficient which is why I'm giving it 4-stars."
959,"I've been to Sliver Pizzeria over 5 times and I've never had a bad pizza.  Some pizzas are tastier than others though.  Check out Sliver's website to see the pizza of the day!  Sliver only sells one type of pizza each day and the pizza is always vegetarian!  Be sure to warn any meat lovers you may be taking to Sliver with you.  I didn't warn my Filipino meat-loving mom when I took her to Sliver and she was shocked that there weren't any meat pizzas available.  She said she was going to go to Top Dog nearby to get a hot dog to fill her need for meat. -__-  Anyway, when you eat the pizza at Sliver, be sure to put some of the free green sauce on it.  The pizza is not complete without the green sauce.  Also, if you plan to drink alcohol at Sliver, I do not recommend the sangria.  It just tasted like juice and there were no visible fruits in the drink...  It could've been better."
960,"Sliver, the place started by a few former Cheeseboard employees who said the hell with the collective and started serving alcohol, making it a great place to watch a game and have a drink. Won't be a stretch to say that they took a few things with them - mainly the concept of one type of vegetarian pizza daily and that amazing green sauce!The pizza is amazing. Yes, some days are better than others but this is subjective and depends on your pizza preferences. But what's better than an amazing pizza? Amazing pizza you can share with friends while drinking a cold one and watching the game. This is where the two concepts diverge. One is not better than the other, it just depends on what you prefer in the specific case. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Is it a bit overhyped? Sure, but it mostly delivers."
961,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE. It's so hard to chew that my jaw literally hurts so much I don't even want to eat anymore. It's like chewing on cardboard.I definitely DO NOT want to come back here and would rather eat some Dominos, Pizza Hut, pls anything else but this."
962,"I got Sliver delivered by Caviar. The whole pie was 24$ plus taxes $2 something and $4 something for service fee plus 2$ tip. So even though Delivery was free the total charge for whole pizza came out to 33$ for me. Not cheap at all. Probably won't get it delivered again. Today's pizza had potatoes, caramelized onions (according to the menu but I couldn't taste it at all), goat cheese, mozzarella and olive oil. The whole pie came with 2 slivers (1 extra slice) which was a nice touch. The pizza was good and cilantro sauce was yum. It's basically chutney (Indian sauce lol). Overall,Not the best pizza I've had by far but it was good. Definitely wasn't worth what I spent on it."
963,"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Since they've only got one kind of pizza a day the only decision you have to make is how much to order! Another positive to this method is that it's ready immediately - they've just got hot pizzas waiting to be plated.  Between my boyfriend and I, we split a half and I ended up taking home a slice.  Totally reasonable prices - the half was not much more than $12, and they were very generous.There were a lot of flies inside, but what can you expect for a sports bar?  This is a casual spot and clearly popular with all the cal students.  We ate in but will probably do take out next time because parking kind of sucks in the area.They've got an amazing cilantro sauce that goes on the pizza that I would recommend to anyone (even cilantro haters, like myself)!  Love that you don't have to ask for water cups, and there's foil and paper bags to wrap your leftovers in.  Will definitely be back!"
964,"TL;DR 1 AWESOME vegetarian pizza/dayWhat is Sliver:They serve 1 vegetarian pizza each day. Meat lovers: don't be afraid, it will be great, and it will satisfy you.PLUSES:+ location: DT Berkeley, next to BART station & Cal+ vegetarian!! + crust + toppings are awesome, their 1 flavor a day pizza has never disappointed+ check online to see what the toppings of the day are+ their long line can be intimidating, but goes by pretty fastDELTAS:- Not as good as Cheese....."
965,"Oh my god, the green sauce!!! That was the biggest game changer for this place. I first went here when I was visiting my boyfriend in Berkeley. I could eat pizza everyday and this was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas that I have tried. I'm so heartbroken that I don't live anywhere near here because this would for sure be my go to place. The way this place works is that they have one flavor that they serve a day and that's it. And while that may not seem appealing at first it's like a mini adventure to try something that you might not have ever thought of ordering before. Every time I walked by this place it seemed like it was completely packed and every table was taken so that already is a pretty good sign that you're in for something good.About half of a full pizza was about $12 and even sharing that with two people was more than enough especially with the extra slivers that you get on top.I went here on a Thursday so when I went the pizza of the day was the roasted Yukon gold potato pizza. When I first heard that they were gonna be putting potatoes on my pizza I was a little hesitant but after taking one bite I was completely sold. You 100% have to get the green sauce to go with your pizza. It  enhances the flavor so well and makes it 10x better. If you don't use it you're doing it wrong. Can't wait to try the other pizzas of the day when I go back to visit."
966,"I absolutely love this pizza place. I might be a bit sentimental, but I've spent a lot of time with some of my best friends at Slivers. They give you a sliver of pizza every time you order a slice, or two slivers if you order a whole pizza. The first time I had it, I didn't even realize I was eating a vegetarian pizza! Everyday they have a different pizza, and they only serve one type of pizza a day. Super unique, and very efficient. If you like a bit of kick to your pizza, try their green sauce next to the water. It goes so well with any of their pizzas. If you want to find me in Berkeley, Slivers is where I'll be."
967,"3.5 round up / We came here bc the line for Cheeseboard intimidated us. Today's special had corn!!!!! Corn on  pizza is the best. The cilantro green sauce was also good. The line was really short but the service for the bar was quite slow. They check IDs for each beer *_* I'm old af. Below average beer selection. Good place for college or high school dates, lol.I don't actually understand the hype of this place and would only recommend if you are craving pizza in the area."
968,"I came here during memorial day on a recommendation that this is one of the best pizza places in Berkeley. It seems like any other pizza joint styles places with a good beer selection, tv, and pizza. At this point you don't have a menu, you have one pizza. We ordered the half pizza and got 2 slices for free. It seem pretty awesome to get some extra pizza. I enjoyed the ambiance of the pizza place ; Sports bar. Parking is tricky here in the sense that its street parking if you're lucky or the paid parking lot across the street. I came here for lunch when it just opened so it wasn't crowded but given that this is a college town I can see how crowded this gets. I loved the pizza. However I do like my freedom of choice and not being told what to eat. Though this is like a omakase style pizza joint, I'd prefer creating my own pizza place. But if I'm back in Berkeley I would hit up Sliver again or Cheeseboard.GO BEARS!"
969,"I came here on a weekday in the late afternoon to grab a single slice before getting on the Bart. Sliver only offers one flavor of pizza each day and the flavor changes every single day. When I went, the flavor was ""crimini mushrooms, yellow onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, fresh herbs, infused rosemary & chanterelle mushroom olive oil"".The slice comes with a small ""sliver"" on top, which is a nice bonus. The pizza was really oily, so I had to grab some napkins to blot off the oil. The pizza was quite aromatic because of the mushroom olive oil that they used, along with the actual mushrooms on top. The pizza was tasty and flavorful, but I personally didn't find it to be extraordinary and worth the $3.25 (including tax)."
970,"I heard a lot of great things about this place! I went on a Saturday before the lunch rush. I order the special pizza for the day. It had pineapple, arugula, mozzarella and something else. I was surprised when the pizza was tough and hard to bite into. I didn't think it tasted that good. The good thing was the pesto sauce they have on the side. I had to dip my pizza in that so it had some flavor! It could be just this day and the special they had. I see on the menu some of the other specials and it looks bomb. I would come back and try another pizza."
971,"One type of pizza everyday, $3.25 per slice plus you get a little extra sliver. Water dispenser. Delicious pesto sauce condiment. Great outdoor seating as well.Came here to grab a quick bite before a graduation ceremony and was glad to have a full belly."
972,"Sliver is a vegetarian pizza place that serves one type of tasty pizza a day. My favorite flavor so far is definitely the potato and corn, but the other types are also unique and delicious. Occasionally, there are also new unique combinations that feature ingredients like peaches or blue cheese (super interesting to try, you could always buy a slice to try and eat somewhere else closeby if you don't like it). I usually check online to see what flavors they're serving each day that week, since I definitely prefer some pizzas over others. Along with that, there's a green sauce that's a great addition to the the cheesy non-marinara pizzas.

On any given day, Sliver can get pretty busy, and even busier on days when there is a game playing. However, the line usually moves pretty rapidly because pizzas are continuously being baked. But, you might have a hard time find seating. If it does happen don't worry, it it's a nice day out bring your pizza on the front lawn of UC Berkeley. The one thing that makes it special is they actually provide two slivers with your slice of whole pizza, and hence the name. A really good deal is actually getting a slice of pizza and a salad. All the flavors are really good with top notch ingredients but I usually avoid days where they have tomatoes as a topping, as it doesn't add much to the pizza. I usually go for days where the toppings either include potatoes, or mushrooms or corn (best days). My own trope is that their pizza can get pretty oily because of the cheese. However, the green sauce that you can scoop yourself is pretty amazing and helps tame the oils from the pizza. Overall, it's a solid place to get pizza. I only wished sometimes that they did a meat pizza but I guess you can't have it all. Tips - Its cheaper to get a full pizza for $20 and share it between friends! Pros - High quality ingredients and with only one flavor you don't have to decide which flavor you want! Cons - the pizza can get oily but the green sauce help mitigate that."
995,"Pizza is OK but kinda inconsistent.  We stayed at the restaurant for a couple of hours to watch a warrior game.  The first pizza was good while the second one too oily, had way too much cheese,  and was a little undercooked.   I do like the green sauce but do not like the fact that there is only one type of pizza per day.Happy hour is 3PM - 6PM, you get pizza slivers with your order of alcohol."
996,"Their pizza is very much worth the hype! Always vegetarian and made fresh daily, their changing daily menu makes it easy to go every day. Their website is updated with the menu schedule for the week, so make sure to check it before you go! Their crust itself is more of a flatbread style rather than a fluffy crust style, and is slightly greasier than I'd like, but not more than is expected of a typical pizza. Either way, their pairing of toppings is impeccable, and each one is a delight. My personal favorite is the corn pizza, which I like to drizzle some of their pesto and squeeze a hint of lime on. The only thing is the lines can get pretty crazy during peak times, but service is quick."
997,"My boyfriend took me here as a ""must-go"" staple in Berkeley and I didn't know what to expect! The pizza was SO good - albeit a bit oily, but it's pizza (what do you expect). I had no idea what I was eating (what toppings) because we went in, got 2 slices of pizza, was handed the pizza and then walked out to proceed with our Berkeley food tour. Apparently the pizza of the day was something with kalamata olives (which I thought were some sort of meat) but ALL THEIR PIZZAS ARE VEGETARIAN ! I hope this place continues to change people's perceptions of vegetarian pizzas being less flavorful, delicious or desirable because this pizza was definitely better than many of the meat-included pizzas I've had in my LIFETIME. Definitely worth the visit, prices are reasonable because you're in a college town, good quality, would 10/10 recommend."
998,"The green sauce!!! Sliver's green sauce is the main reason I want to eat here all the time.(For reference, I have never tried Cheese Board)Sliver changes their pizza toppings daily, so check their website before going in if you're a picky eater! My favorite pizzas are the ones topped with corn and mushrooms. Their pizzas are more like cheesy bread (think of a flatter version of the cheese bread at Sweet Tomatoes). They have a thin crust with a generous amount of cheese + a sparse sprinkle of toppings. Their sauce is the reason I keep coming back--it's tangy with a bit of heat. It's the perfect compliment to their cheesy pizza and would taste good on practically anything.For the price (a bit over $20 for a whole pizza or a few bucks for slice), I do wish that they'd be more generous with the toppings. Also, from a value perspective, not the most cost-efficient which is why I'm giving it 4-stars."
999,"I've been to Sliver Pizzeria over 5 times and I've never had a bad pizza.  Some pizzas are tastier than others though.  Check out Sliver's website to see the pizza of the day!  Sliver only sells one type of pizza each day and the pizza is always vegetarian!  Be sure to warn any meat lovers you may be taking to Sliver with you.  I didn't warn my Filipino meat-loving mom when I took her to Sliver and she was shocked that there weren't any meat pizzas available.  She said she was going to go to Top Dog nearby to get a hot dog to fill her need for meat. -__-  Anyway, when you eat the pizza at Sliver, be sure to put some of the free green sauce on it.  The pizza is not complete without the green sauce.  Also, if you plan to drink alcohol at Sliver, I do not recommend the sangria.  It just tasted like juice and there were no visible fruits in the drink...  It could've been better."
1000,"Sliver, the place started by a few former Cheeseboard employees who said the hell with the collective and started serving alcohol, making it a great place to watch a game and have a drink. Won't be a stretch to say that they took a few things with them - mainly the concept of one type of vegetarian pizza daily and that amazing green sauce!The pizza is amazing. Yes, some days are better than others but this is subjective and depends on your pizza preferences. But what's better than an amazing pizza? Amazing pizza you can share with friends while drinking a cold one and watching the game. This is where the two concepts diverge. One is not better than the other, it just depends on what you prefer in the specific case. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Is it a bit overhyped? Sure, but it mostly delivers."
1001,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE. It's so hard to chew that my jaw literally hurts so much I don't even want to eat anymore. It's like chewing on cardboard.I definitely DO NOT want to come back here and would rather eat some Dominos, Pizza Hut, pls anything else but this."
1002,"I got Sliver delivered by Caviar. The whole pie was 24$ plus taxes $2 something and $4 something for service fee plus 2$ tip. So even though Delivery was free the total charge for whole pizza came out to 33$ for me. Not cheap at all. Probably won't get it delivered again. Today's pizza had potatoes, caramelized onions (according to the menu but I couldn't taste it at all), goat cheese, mozzarella and olive oil. The whole pie came with 2 slivers (1 extra slice) which was a nice touch. The pizza was good and cilantro sauce was yum. It's basically chutney (Indian sauce lol). Overall,Not the best pizza I've had by far but it was good. Definitely wasn't worth what I spent on it."
1003,"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Since they've only got one kind of pizza a day the only decision you have to make is how much to order! Another positive to this method is that it's ready immediately - they've just got hot pizzas waiting to be plated.  Between my boyfriend and I, we split a half and I ended up taking home a slice.  Totally reasonable prices - the half was not much more than $12, and they were very generous.There were a lot of flies inside, but what can you expect for a sports bar?  This is a casual spot and clearly popular with all the cal students.  We ate in but will probably do take out next time because parking kind of sucks in the area.They've got an amazing cilantro sauce that goes on the pizza that I would recommend to anyone (even cilantro haters, like myself)!  Love that you don't have to ask for water cups, and there's foil and paper bags to wrap your leftovers in.  Will definitely be back!"
1004,"TL;DR 1 AWESOME vegetarian pizza/dayWhat is Sliver:They serve 1 vegetarian pizza each day. Meat lovers: don't be afraid, it will be great, and it will satisfy you.PLUSES:+ location: DT Berkeley, next to BART station & Cal+ vegetarian!! + crust + toppings are awesome, their 1 flavor a day pizza has never disappointed+ check online to see what the toppings of the day are+ their long line can be intimidating, but goes by pretty fastDELTAS:- Not as good as Cheese....."
1005,"Oh my god, the green sauce!!! That was the biggest game changer for this place. I first went here when I was visiting my boyfriend in Berkeley. I could eat pizza everyday and this was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas that I have tried. I'm so heartbroken that I don't live anywhere near here because this would for sure be my go to place. The way this place works is that they have one flavor that they serve a day and that's it. And while that may not seem appealing at first it's like a mini adventure to try something that you might not have ever thought of ordering before. Every time I walked by this place it seemed like it was completely packed and every table was taken so that already is a pretty good sign that you're in for something good.About half of a full pizza was about $12 and even sharing that with two people was more than enough especially with the extra slivers that you get on top.I went here on a Thursday so when I went the pizza of the day was the roasted Yukon gold potato pizza. When I first heard that they were gonna be putting potatoes on my pizza I was a little hesitant but after taking one bite I was completely sold. You 100% have to get the green sauce to go with your pizza. It  enhances the flavor so well and makes it 10x better. If you don't use it you're doing it wrong. Can't wait to try the other pizzas of the day when I go back to visit."
1006,"I absolutely love this pizza place. I might be a bit sentimental, but I've spent a lot of time with some of my best friends at Slivers. They give you a sliver of pizza every time you order a slice, or two slivers if you order a whole pizza. The first time I had it, I didn't even realize I was eating a vegetarian pizza! Everyday they have a different pizza, and they only serve one type of pizza a day. Super unique, and very efficient. If you like a bit of kick to your pizza, try their green sauce next to the water. It goes so well with any of their pizzas. If you want to find me in Berkeley, Slivers is where I'll be."
1007,"3.5 round up / We came here bc the line for Cheeseboard intimidated us. Today's special had corn!!!!! Corn on  pizza is the best. The cilantro green sauce was also good. The line was really short but the service for the bar was quite slow. They check IDs for each beer *_* I'm old af. Below average beer selection. Good place for college or high school dates, lol.I don't actually understand the hype of this place and would only recommend if you are craving pizza in the area."
1008,"I came here during memorial day on a recommendation that this is one of the best pizza places in Berkeley. It seems like any other pizza joint styles places with a good beer selection, tv, and pizza. At this point you don't have a menu, you have one pizza. We ordered the half pizza and got 2 slices for free. It seem pretty awesome to get some extra pizza. I enjoyed the ambiance of the pizza place ; Sports bar. Parking is tricky here in the sense that its street parking if you're lucky or the paid parking lot across the street. I came here for lunch when it just opened so it wasn't crowded but given that this is a college town I can see how crowded this gets. I loved the pizza. However I do like my freedom of choice and not being told what to eat. Though this is like a omakase style pizza joint, I'd prefer creating my own pizza place. But if I'm back in Berkeley I would hit up Sliver again or Cheeseboard.GO BEARS!"
1009,"I came here on a weekday in the late afternoon to grab a single slice before getting on the Bart. Sliver only offers one flavor of pizza each day and the flavor changes every single day. When I went, the flavor was ""crimini mushrooms, yellow onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, fresh herbs, infused rosemary & chanterelle mushroom olive oil"".The slice comes with a small ""sliver"" on top, which is a nice bonus. The pizza was really oily, so I had to grab some napkins to blot off the oil. The pizza was quite aromatic because of the mushroom olive oil that they used, along with the actual mushrooms on top. The pizza was tasty and flavorful, but I personally didn't find it to be extraordinary and worth the $3.25 (including tax)."
1010,"I heard a lot of great things about this place! I went on a Saturday before the lunch rush. I order the special pizza for the day. It had pineapple, arugula, mozzarella and something else. I was surprised when the pizza was tough and hard to bite into. I didn't think it tasted that good. The good thing was the pesto sauce they have on the side. I had to dip my pizza in that so it had some flavor! It could be just this day and the special they had. I see on the menu some of the other specials and it looks bomb. I would come back and try another pizza."
1011,"One type of pizza everyday, $3.25 per slice plus you get a little extra sliver. Water dispenser. Delicious pesto sauce condiment. Great outdoor seating as well.Came here to grab a quick bite before a graduation ceremony and was glad to have a full belly."
1012,"Sliver is a vegetarian pizza place that serves one type of tasty pizza a day. My favorite flavor so far is definitely the potato and corn, but the other types are also unique and delicious. Occasionally, there are also new unique combinations that feature ingredients like peaches or blue cheese (super interesting to try, you could always buy a slice to try and eat somewhere else closeby if you don't like it). I usually check online to see what flavors they're serving each day that week, since I definitely prefer some pizzas over others. Along with that, there's a green sauce that's a great addition to the the cheesy non-marinara pizzas. They also serve frescas now, which are refreshing and not overly sweet.It's probably important to note that this place is very similar to Cheeseboard, in pizza and concept. Though it's still a quick and affordable place (especially closer to campus) for some delicious pizza."
1013,"Pizza here reminds me of their East Bay neighbors The Cheese Board, Arizmendi Bakery, and Nabolom Bakery. All of them are serving one type of vegetarian pizza daily and aiming to create a community around good food including pizza. Prices are more or less similar too.Like The Cheese Board and Nabolom, their green sauce is a must try. Spicy sauce fans forget red chili pepper flakes and grab a few containers of their sauce.What sets Sliver Pizzeria from the rest is the setting. It's a sports bar with a full bar inside, TVs with sports on, long community tables, happy hour specials, and live music Friday's and Saturday's. If you're not in the mood, you can always get it to go or sit outside.I personally prefer Nabolom and Arizmendi's crust, but the pizza here is still solid.

Pros - High quality ingredients and with only one flavor you don't have to decide which flavor you want! Cons - the pizza can get oily but the green sauce help mitigate that."
1035,"Pizza is OK but kinda inconsistent.  We stayed at the restaurant for a couple of hours to watch a warrior game.  The first pizza was good while the second one too oily, had way too much cheese,  and was a little undercooked.   I do like the green sauce but do not like the fact that there is only one type of pizza per day.Happy hour is 3PM - 6PM, you get pizza slivers with your order of alcohol."
1036,"Their pizza is very much worth the hype! Always vegetarian and made fresh daily, their changing daily menu makes it easy to go every day. Their website is updated with the menu schedule for the week, so make sure to check it before you go! Their crust itself is more of a flatbread style rather than a fluffy crust style, and is slightly greasier than I'd like, but not more than is expected of a typical pizza. Either way, their pairing of toppings is impeccable, and each one is a delight. My personal favorite is the corn pizza, which I like to drizzle some of their pesto and squeeze a hint of lime on. The only thing is the lines can get pretty crazy during peak times, but service is quick."
1037,"My boyfriend took me here as a ""must-go"" staple in Berkeley and I didn't know what to expect! The pizza was SO good - albeit a bit oily, but it's pizza (what do you expect). I had no idea what I was eating (what toppings) because we went in, got 2 slices of pizza, was handed the pizza and then walked out to proceed with our Berkeley food tour. Apparently the pizza of the day was something with kalamata olives (which I thought were some sort of meat) but ALL THEIR PIZZAS ARE VEGETARIAN ! I hope this place continues to change people's perceptions of vegetarian pizzas being less flavorful, delicious or desirable because this pizza was definitely better than many of the meat-included pizzas I've had in my LIFETIME. Definitely worth the visit, prices are reasonable because you're in a college town, good quality, would 10/10 recommend."
1038,"The green sauce!!! Sliver's green sauce is the main reason I want to eat here all the time.(For reference, I have never tried Cheese Board)Sliver changes their pizza toppings daily, so check their website before going in if you're a picky eater! My favorite pizzas are the ones topped with corn and mushrooms. Their pizzas are more like cheesy bread (think of a flatter version of the cheese bread at Sweet Tomatoes). They have a thin crust with a generous amount of cheese + a sparse sprinkle of toppings. Their sauce is the reason I keep coming back--it's tangy with a bit of heat. It's the perfect compliment to their cheesy pizza and would taste good on practically anything.For the price (a bit over $20 for a whole pizza or a few bucks for slice), I do wish that they'd be more generous with the toppings. Also, from a value perspective, not the most cost-efficient which is why I'm giving it 4-stars."
1039,"I've been to Sliver Pizzeria over 5 times and I've never had a bad pizza.  Some pizzas are tastier than others though.  Check out Sliver's website to see the pizza of the day!  Sliver only sells one type of pizza each day and the pizza is always vegetarian!  Be sure to warn any meat lovers you may be taking to Sliver with you.  I didn't warn my Filipino meat-loving mom when I took her to Sliver and she was shocked that there weren't any meat pizzas available.  She said she was going to go to Top Dog nearby to get a hot dog to fill her need for meat. -__-  Anyway, when you eat the pizza at Sliver, be sure to put some of the free green sauce on it.  The pizza is not complete without the green sauce.  Also, if you plan to drink alcohol at Sliver, I do not recommend the sangria.  It just tasted like juice and there were no visible fruits in the drink...  It could've been better."
1040,"Sliver, the place started by a few former Cheeseboard employees who said the hell with the collective and started serving alcohol, making it a great place to watch a game and have a drink. Won't be a stretch to say that they took a few things with them - mainly the concept of one type of vegetarian pizza daily and that amazing green sauce!The pizza is amazing. Yes, some days are better than others but this is subjective and depends on your pizza preferences. But what's better than an amazing pizza? Amazing pizza you can share with friends while drinking a cold one and watching the game. This is where the two concepts diverge. One is not better than the other, it just depends on what you prefer in the specific case. I'd highly recommend this to anyone. Is it a bit overhyped? Sure, but it mostly delivers."
1041,"Talk about overrateddddd. They had basic cheese pizza with some corn on it. The pesto sauce  is what brings it to 2 stars. It really adds delicious flavor to the pizza.The line goes by fast and by the time we were done with the line, my friends who were waiting was able to get a table for about 10 of us. It's cool that they also give you a sliver of pizza on top of the full pizza you order which is SO COOL.The pizza is tasty, but what turns me completely off is the TEXTURE. It's so hard to chew that my jaw literally hurts so much I don't even want to eat anymore. It's like chewing on cardboard.I definitely DO NOT want to come back here and would rather eat some Dominos, Pizza Hut, pls anything else but this."
1042,"I got Sliver delivered by Caviar. The whole pie was 24$ plus taxes $2 something and $4 something for service fee plus 2$ tip. So even though Delivery was free the total charge for whole pizza came out to 33$ for me. Not cheap at all. Probably won't get it delivered again. Today's pizza had potatoes, caramelized onions (according to the menu but I couldn't taste it at all), goat cheese, mozzarella and olive oil. The whole pie came with 2 slivers (1 extra slice) which was a nice touch. The pizza was good and cilantro sauce was yum. It's basically chutney (Indian sauce lol). Overall,Not the best pizza I've had by far but it was good. Definitely wasn't worth what I spent on it."
1043,"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Since they've only got one kind of pizza a day the only decision you have to make is how much to order! Another positive to this method is that it's ready immediately - they've just got hot pizzas waiting to be plated.  Between my boyfriend and I, we split a half and I ended up taking home a slice.  Totally reasonable prices - the half was not much more than $12, and they were very generous.There were a lot of flies inside, but what can you expect for a sports bar?  This is a casual spot and clearly popular with all the cal students.  We ate in but will probably do take out next time because parking kind of sucks in the area.They've got an amazing cilantro sauce that goes on the pizza that I would recommend to anyone (even cilantro haters, like myself)!  Love that you don't have to ask for water cups, and there's foil and paper bags to wrap your leftovers in.  Will definitely be back!"
1044,"TL;DR 1 AWESOME vegetarian pizza/dayWhat is Sliver:They serve 1 vegetarian pizza each day. Meat lovers: don't be afraid, it will be great, and it will satisfy you.PLUSES:+ location: DT Berkeley, next to BART station & Cal+ vegetarian!! + crust + toppings are awesome, their 1 flavor a day pizza has never disappointed+ check online to see what the toppings of the day are+ their long line can be intimidating, but goes by pretty fastDELTAS:- Not as good as Cheese....."
1045,"Oh my god, the green sauce!!! That was the biggest game changer for this place. I first went here when I was visiting my boyfriend in Berkeley. I could eat pizza everyday and this was hands down one of the tastiest pizzas that I have tried. I'm so heartbroken that I don't live anywhere near here because this would for sure be my go to place. The way this place works is that they have one flavor that they serve a day and that's it. And while that may not seem appealing at first it's like a mini adventure to try something that you might not have ever thought of ordering before. Every time I walked by this place it seemed like it was completely packed and every table was taken so that already is a pretty good sign that you're in for something good.About half of a full pizza was about $12 and even sharing that with two people was more than enough especially with the extra slivers that you get on top.I went here on a Thursday so when I went the pizza of the day was the roasted Yukon gold potato pizza. When I first heard that they were gonna be putting potatoes on my pizza I was a little hesitant but after taking one bite I was completely sold. You 100% have to get the green sauce to go with your pizza. It  enhances the flavor so well and makes it 10x better. If you don't use it you're doing it wrong. Can't wait to try the other pizzas of the day when I go back to visit."
1046,"I absolutely love this pizza place. I might be a bit sentimental, but I've spent a lot of time with some of my best friends at Slivers. They give you a sliver of pizza every time you order a slice, or two slivers if you order a whole pizza. The first time I had it, I didn't even realize I was eating a vegetarian pizza! Everyday they have a different pizza, and they only serve one type of pizza a day. Super unique, and very efficient. If you like a bit of kick to your pizza, try their green sauce next to the water. It goes so well with any of their pizzas. If you want to find me in Berkeley, Slivers is where I'll be."
1047,"3.5 round up / We came here bc the line for Cheeseboard intimidated us. Today's special had corn!!!!! Corn on  pizza is the best. The cilantro green sauce was also good. The line was really short but the service for the bar was quite slow. They check IDs for each beer *_* I'm old af. Below average beer selection. Good place for college or high school dates, lol.I don't actually understand the hype of this place and would only recommend if you are craving pizza in the area."
1048,"I came here during memorial day on a recommendation that this is one of the best pizza places in Berkeley. It seems like any other pizza joint styles places with a good beer selection, tv, and pizza. At this point you don't have a menu, you have one pizza. We ordered the half pizza and got 2 slices for free. It seem pretty awesome to get some extra pizza. I enjoyed the ambiance of the pizza place ; Sports bar. Parking is tricky here in the sense that its street parking if you're lucky or the paid parking lot across the street. I came here for lunch when it just opened so it wasn't crowded but given that this is a college town I can see how crowded this gets. I loved the pizza. However I do like my freedom of choice and not being told what to eat. Though this is like a omakase style pizza joint, I'd prefer creating my own pizza place. But if I'm back in Berkeley I would hit up Sliver again or Cheeseboard.GO BEARS!"
1049,"I came here on a weekday in the late afternoon to grab a single slice before getting on the Bart. Sliver only offers one flavor of pizza each day and the flavor changes every single day. When I went, the flavor was ""crimini mushrooms, yellow onions, mozzarella, goat cheese, fresh herbs, infused rosemary & chanterelle mushroom olive oil"".The slice comes with a small ""sliver"" on top, which is a nice bonus. The pizza was really oily, so I had to grab some napkins to blot off the oil. The pizza was quite aromatic because of the mushroom olive oil that they used, along with the actual mushrooms on top. The pizza was tasty and flavorful, but I personally didn't find it to be extraordinary and worth the $3.25 (including tax)."
1050,"I heard a lot of great things about this place! I went on a Saturday before the lunch rush. I order the special pizza for the day. It had pineapple, arugula, mozzarella and something else. I was surprised when the pizza was tough and hard to bite into. I didn't think it tasted that good. The good thing was the pesto sauce they have on the side. I had to dip my pizza in that so it had some flavor! It could be just this day and the special they had. I see on the menu some of the other specials and it looks bomb. I would come back and try another pizza."
1051,"One type of pizza everyday, $3.25 per slice plus you get a little extra sliver. Water dispenser. Delicious pesto sauce condiment. Great outdoor seating as well.Came here to grab a quick bite before a graduation ceremony and was glad to have a full belly."
1052,"Sliver is a vegetarian pizza place that serves one type of tasty pizza a day. My favorite flavor so far is definitely the potato and corn, but the other types are also unique and delicious. Occasionally, there are also new unique combinations that feature ingredients like peaches or blue cheese (super interesting to try, you could always buy a slice to try and eat somewhere else closeby if you don't like it). I usually check online to see what flavors they're serving each day that week, since I definitely prefer some pizzas over others. Along with that, there's a green sauce that's a great addition to the the cheesy non-marinara pizzas. They also serve frescas now, which are refreshing and not overly sweet.It's probably important to note that this place is very similar to Cheeseboard, in pizza and concept. Though it's still a quick and affordable place (especially closer to campus) for some delicious pizza."
1053,"Pizza here reminds me of their East Bay neighbors The Cheese Board, Arizmendi Bakery, and Nabolom Bakery. All of them are serving one type of vegetarian pizza daily and aiming to create a community around good food including pizza. Prices are more or less similar too.Like The Cheese Board and Nabolom, their green sauce is a must try. Spicy sauce fans forget red chili pepper flakes and grab a few containers of their sauce.What sets Sliver Pizzeria from the rest is the setting. It's a sports bar with a full bar inside, TVs with sports on, long community tables, happy hour specials, and live music Friday's and Saturday's. If you're not in the mood, you can always get it to go or sit outside.I personally prefer Nabolom and Arizmendi's crust, but the pizza here is still solid. Plus, you gotta love those extra baby slices with your pizza."
1054,"Food 4/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. Bang for your buck 4/5. A great place to catch the games and get some pizzas with high quality ingredients. Note this place only has vegetarian pizza and one flavor per day. Check on their website to see which flavor is showcased today! On any given day, Sliver can get pretty busy, and even busier on days when there is a game playing. However, the line usually moves pretty rapidly because pizzas are continuously being baked. But, you might have a hard time find seating. If it does happen don't worry, it it's a nice day out bring your pizza on the front lawn of UC Berkeley. The one thing that makes it special is they actually provide two slivers with your slice of whole pizza, and hence the name. A really good deal is actually getting a slice of pizza and a salad. All the flavors are really good with top notch ingredients but I usually avoid days where they have tomatoes as a topping, as it doesn't add much to the pizza. I usually go for days where the toppings either include potatoes, or mushrooms or corn (best days). My own trope is that their pizza can get pretty oily because of the cheese. However, the green sauce that you can scoop yourself is pretty amazing and helps tame the oils from the pizza. Overall, it's a solid place to get pizza. I only wished sometimes that they did a meat pizza but I guess you can't have it all. Tips - Its cheaper to get a full pizza for $20 and share it between friends!
