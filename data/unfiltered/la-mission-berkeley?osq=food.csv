0,"TL;DR 5/5 carnitas tacosCame here during dinner time, line was not too bad. I ordered 3 tacos, carnitas, carne asada, and another something taco. The sauce, cilantro, onion, everything was the perfect taste and ratio. My favorite was the carnitas, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. They have a wide variety of items on their menu, and I will definitely be back to try the rest!This is my friend's top taco place in Berkeley, and I would also put this at the top of my list.La Mission is accessible via AC Transit 51B or car (small parking lot in the back)."
1,How come my simple to-go order can't be prepared correctly? Is asking for pico de gallo too complicated? I'm tired of getting home to find out that my food was made incorrectly. I try to keep any additions simple. I think I forgot why I like La Mission. I'm finished hoping you'll get my order right.
2,"we got off our night shift and went here for breakfast. There was no wait time at all, the restaurant just opened for the day. we were first customers. restaurant was very clean. There was a breakfast menu and we could order from full menu. we also ordered pitcher of sangria - which was  great.4 star for food. felt like food was cooked quick, slightly undercooked. 5 star for service. Will def stop by here for more food"
3,"I so wanted breakfast, My meeting ran late so I had to settle for the tacos. The grilled fish taco was good. The Tacos al pastor were ok. Not great although not bad. Tortillas are small although they make up for the amount of meat they put on. Salsa did not have much flavor. The staff was friendly and I will be back for the breakfast."
4,"Best spot in Berkeley for Mexican food.  My favorite is the baja fish taco, $5.50.  I thought it was expensive for one taco but it is huge!  They give a generous serving of fish, crema, cabbage, and tomatoes.  I love the breading of the fish, giving a nice crispy texture with moist fish inside, and the crema makes for a great flavor combo.  Delish!The horchata is really sweet, but becomes perfect when the ice melts.  This place has got friendly staff, a great vibe, is clean, has outside garden seating, and also boasts a parking lot in the back to top it off (no Berkeley street parking necessary)."
5,"Service was efficient and friendly, but La Mission's chicken dishes leave everything to be desired. If you eat pork, they have your back (the pozole for example), but the chicken is literally tiny dry cubes of meat with no flavor. I spent 17$ and change on two street tacos a small salad and one beer. Seemed outrageously high relative to the quality and amount of food. Maybe the other tacos are just so much more delicious? If I were them I would pull all the cubed chicken off the menu. The green salad was good, though sparse. I liked that it had pepitas, cabbage shreds and a vinaigrette dressing. Not sure I would come back just for that though with so many other amazing Mexican places around the area. Sad because I really wanted to love this place!"
6,"This is by far my favorite taco place in the bay area!The grand tacos here has 2 shells (1 soft 1 hard) and has more fillings than normal tacos. I normally go for the beef and the fish taco while my husband will have these 2 and a pork one as well. The fish is always crispy outside and tender inside, with a light dressing to compliment the flavor. The beef taco doesn't skim on the beef quantity like a lot other places. We also like the nachos here. In fact it is the favorite dish for my mother who comes from China. The service is slightly slow here but that's because they make everything fresh. It's a wait I'm willing to have for good quality food。"
7,Best Mexican food in Berkeley. Really really fresh meats and diverse vegetarian choices. Excellent moles and savory menudo. Perfect snacking for a summer afternoon.
8,"Mission Accomplished. Decent Mexican food found in Berkeley!Food: Have your pick from tacos to burritos, soups, entree plates, aguas frescas and even some fresh desserts if you're sweet tooth kicks in. I went with a simple and classic cheesy quesadilla, but added prawns to fancy it up a bit. Oozing with cheesy, grilled to near perfection and boasting with fresh flavors of chopped prawns; it was truly delicious. My friend ordered the Al Pastor Burrito which was packed with some of the best marinated and juicy chunks of meat we've ever had, he ordered it with everything, both of us were surprised the burrito didn't fall apart upon first bite. It was the perfect blend of fresh and savory ingredients all enclosed in a grilled and slightly charred flour tortilla. The salsa was the only issue as it wasn't nearly as spicy nor fresh as I hoped for. Chips are not free, that was a bummer as well. Other than that, the food was solid.Price: A bit steeper than your average casual Mexican eatery, but worth the price. Ambiance: Cozy and small interior, very tight and minimal seating, but they do have a huge outdoor patio equipped with tons of natural shading from the big trees. Parking lot is behind the building.Service: The young man that took our order greeted us with a genuine smile and was very patient. Same story with the young man that brought us our food.Overall: I was getting a bit tired of driving to Oakland for Mexican food, so I'm glad I finally found fresh and decent tasting Mexican food in Berkeley. Prices are a bit steeper than I'd like, but well worth the solid tasting food and wonderful service."
9,"I've come here several times and have had great experiences each time. Be it afternoon, evening, or night, this place has fantastic service and wonderful food.Tonight hubs and I had a beer each while waiting for our order (Santa Fe salad and chile rellenos). The total came to $36 and I tipped up to $42. Seating inside is 8 small-ish tables that seat 2/3 each (booth on the back). There is more seating outside.Even when lines get long, the food comes out fast and hot. The staff are extremely friendly. There's Tapatio and tobasco and other bottles hot sauces available if you dine in."
10,Came here after a wedding and the guys that work here followed us out to our car and took pictures of our license plate as we were trying to leave. They were accusing us of knowing somebody else who they thought hit their truck. Not only will we not be back but we will be following up with this issue as this was completely uncalled for. One of the workers wanted to fight us. That's not how you run a business.
11,"This place has great food. The menu is huge, and reasonably priced. Their breakfast burritos are on point! The food is mixed traditional, authentic Mexican food as well as MexicanAmerican food (burritos, nachos).Everybody here is pretty friendly,  and I think just about everything they make is made from scratch. While you can get your food to go, this is not a ""fast-food"" restaurant, really. It could be fun to sit down there also, there's lots of tables inside and outside. A majority of the food is fresh and made to order and comes out piping-hot off the grill. Don't confuse this with some local Berkeley Taco Bell. Mission is legit, awesome, awesome food."
12,"Hands down the best Mexican food in Berkeley. The mole poblano burrito, either with chicken or carnitas is excellent, and the platanos and beans are awesome. But let me reiterate- do not miss out on the amazing mole here!!!Casual atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating, in a quiet area of Berkeley far from the university. Food is delivered to your table quickly, service is nothing outstanding, but good enough.Food is priced well for how much food you get- I paid a bit over $10 for a burrito that's probably going to keep me full for two days lolol"
13,"We had a good experience at La Mission this afternoon. We ordered tacos de papa, cocktail, and tacos de Barbacoa. Tacos were delicious, cocktail filling, lots of shrimp. Juice and sangria were so so. But overall good experience. Fresh breeze, out door  seating and friendly staff!"
14,"Super awesome taqueria right on the main drag of university avenue.They have their own small parking lot behind the building accessible via chestnut st. in addition to the usual street parking. Usually there's a spot or two available at any given time, although the super popular lunch rush can be very busy.There is pleasing inside and outside seating. The outside seating is larger then most places of this type, and is particularly nice on a sunny day, what with the natural shade provided by several friendly trees. Inside seating is the usual booth/chair combos al fast food restaurant style.  the look of the place scream re-purposed fast food chain to me, but the owners have made it all their own local styling, even if the inside is dominated by the order counter.Service  is of the order and pick up when called model. The menu consists of the usual taqueria suspects-burrito, taco, combo platters with slightly more variety. They offer the full range of meats including barbacoa, lengua, camarón (shrimp) and several different varieties of fish. There are also three different stylings of veg burrito/tacos including vegan and grilled veg options, which is nice to see. The breakfast menu is especially strong, and they have an awesome salsa/condiment bar.  Pricing for these items is fairly standard for the area about three bucks a taco and everything else pretty much starts at 7 bucks. Typically a meal will run about ten dollars with a drink and add ons, but it's possible to go the bare bones bargain route for slightly less. It's the flavor, convenience, and quality of the food that really shines here.One of the better lunch/breakfast options for the area for sure."
15,"Solid, good, authentic mexican food.   Whether you want tacos, enchiladas, tortas, burritos, pozole, etc., this place does not disappoint.Highly recommend for the price and the service.  There is also a parking lot and great outdoor seating."
16,I have frequently passed by this place but never gave it any thought to stop by but with the recommendation we decided to stop in for lunch I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and good this place actually was Food: grilled chicken tacos & steak (good) blk beans & rice everything was fresh the food was heavy which I liked and I like the way the meat  was cut into small pieces because I definitely dislike big chunks of meat with a lot of fat Service: fastAmbience: gives u a little feel of a little taqueria in Mexico Conclusion: better than I thought I will definitely return I love their chicken tacos and their rice and beans everything was fresh very tasty very good light and healthy I would say give this place a try
17,"Taco Trek Lesson 3, THE TORTILLA. The CORN tortilla is the double-layered  backbone of the taco experience, setting the tone for moisture and texture throughout the bite. The flavor of the corn is the floor upon which the flavors of the meat, fat, and toppings dance the Salsa! When talk-talking tacos, there are two types of corn tortillas to consider: fresh-made and factory-made.* Fresh tortillas are rare. If you're lucky enough to find tortillas rolled out ON-THE-SPOT from a press, quality is a WRAP! Fresh corn tortillas are always perfectly moist and tender, and need minimal added fat. The experience is like eating supple wontons or dumplings; the fresh tortilla is as pliable as soft cloth, and the corn never wads up into dry unpleasantness in the back of your mouth. Fresh tortillas, however, have zero shelf-life, and thus we get to...* Factory tortillas, which are common. Tortillas made in a factory have added preservatives and binding agents that make them dense, dry, and disgusting -- but they can be made awesome again through the absorption of enough fat on a hot griddle! Simply steaming factory tortillas is UNACCEPTABLE to a tacossieur like me, because they get doughy and taste acidic. Automatic Taco Fail!* Pro-tip: You can tell the QUALITY of a corn tortilla just from a TACO PHOTO. :::: Positively Awesome: 1) Round corners at the folds, 2) Oil-stained, deep color, 3) some shine on the surface -- tender and moist, let's rejoice! 4) Greased spots of golden-brown -- crisped on the griddle to be chewy in the middle!:::: God-Awful: 1) Sharp corners at the folded edges -- MEH, mostly dry. 2) Light-colored, dry-looking surface -- cotton-mouth! Keep away! 3) Wet, doughy-looking surface (sure sign of gringo tacos) -- acidic YUCKTOWN._______ Strictly a review of La Mission's TACOS _______Tacos were sadly MEH-diocre. I suspect the overall 4-star review was was given by burrito-eaters that are HIGHLY FORGIVING of crappy meats. Time to take a BART ride to the Fruitvale for some real-deal taco trucks, my Gringos. Check out my TACO TREK LIST to get you started.3   M I N U S E S- FAILS de CARNESRemember, tacos are all about delivering delicious MEAT-DECADENCE into your mouth. No hiding the flavor of the meat with cheese, lettuce, beans, rice, guac, cream, etc. Pureza means PURITY!:::: Borrego -- MEH-EH-EH-EH. Lamb Barbacoa was gamy and dry. The marinade was decent, but not enough to rescue the meat. I had one bite of LAMB FAT that was great, though.:::: Al Pastor -- MEH'VERAGE. All around dry, barely tasted any pork fat. The shallow marinade tasted like mild Tapatio.:::: Carnitas -- GAR'MEHGE. Chipotle-vels of CarMEHtas failure. Didn't even taste like pork. More of a dry, cotton-mouthed protein filler. Awful.- BORED-TILLAS:::: Tortillas -- NEED LOTION. Dry, and in need of moisturizing from some oil. After 4 minutes, these unlotioned tortillas absorbed too much moisture, thus becoming doughy in places, and pretty gross. Folks who prefer flour tortillas to corn tortillas do so because of tortillas LIKE THESE.- GRINGOFIED MENUMeat quality is automatically suspect if certain authentic and standard carnes aren't on the menu: no cabeza, no lengua, no tripe... This probably means that the clientele is inexperienced, and thus these delicacies will go unordered. This probably also means that the meats that are on the menu aren't going to be that awesome because the aforementioned inexperienced clientele will not demand quality.2   S T A R S* STEAK'ED THEIR CLAIM:::: Carne Asada Taco -- PURDY GOOD. Although the morsels alone seemed dry, biting into a mouthful of steak produced lovely moisture, and smoky flavor.*(1/2) BRIGHT-EYED SERVICEWelcoming, attentive, and bright-eyed friendliness from everyone I interacted with. Thank you so much guys!*(1/2) LOVELY OUTDOOR SPACEBring your beer to the pretty lil outdoor space with a trellis for shade, and enough tables to seat about 20."
18,"I understand from friends that the meat options are tasty, but the veggie and fish burritos and tacos I've had here were poor.The staff are always friendly, and you get nice thick chips, but nothing else has been good the three times I've visited."
19,I am no Mexican food expert but I thought their burrito was solid. I had a plain old vegetarian burrito without any extras like sour cream or guacamole and I also didn't get cheese. They give you a choice of black beans or refried. I super love their salsa offerings. The tomatillo salsa and the other one (I can't remember which) are both delicious and I totally drowned every bite of my burrito with both.The burrito itself was huge but was the perfect thing after I was famished from climbing. Definitely better than Monte Cristo up the street!

The fish is always crispy outside and tender inside, with a light dressing to compliment the flavor. The beef taco doesn't skim on the beef quantity like a lot other places. We also like the nachos here. In fact it is the favorite dish for my mother who comes from China. The service is slightly slow here but that's because they make everything fresh. It's a wait I'm willing to have for good quality food。"
47,Best Mexican food in Berkeley. Really really fresh meats and diverse vegetarian choices. Excellent moles and savory menudo. Perfect snacking for a summer afternoon.
48,"Mission Accomplished. Decent Mexican food found in Berkeley!Food: Have your pick from tacos to burritos, soups, entree plates, aguas frescas and even some fresh desserts if you're sweet tooth kicks in. I went with a simple and classic cheesy quesadilla, but added prawns to fancy it up a bit. Oozing with cheesy, grilled to near perfection and boasting with fresh flavors of chopped prawns; it was truly delicious. My friend ordered the Al Pastor Burrito which was packed with some of the best marinated and juicy chunks of meat we've ever had, he ordered it with everything, both of us were surprised the burrito didn't fall apart upon first bite. It was the perfect blend of fresh and savory ingredients all enclosed in a grilled and slightly charred flour tortilla. The salsa was the only issue as it wasn't nearly as spicy nor fresh as I hoped for. Chips are not free, that was a bummer as well. Other than that, the food was solid.Price: A bit steeper than your average casual Mexican eatery, but worth the price. Ambiance: Cozy and small interior, very tight and minimal seating, but they do have a huge outdoor patio equipped with tons of natural shading from the big trees. Parking lot is behind the building.Service: The young man that took our order greeted us with a genuine smile and was very patient. Same story with the young man that brought us our food.Overall: I was getting a bit tired of driving to Oakland for Mexican food, so I'm glad I finally found fresh and decent tasting Mexican food in Berkeley. Prices are a bit steeper than I'd like, but well worth the solid tasting food and wonderful service."
49,"I've come here several times and have had great experiences each time. Be it afternoon, evening, or night, this place has fantastic service and wonderful food.Tonight hubs and I had a beer each while waiting for our order (Santa Fe salad and chile rellenos). The total came to $36 and I tipped up to $42. Seating inside is 8 small-ish tables that seat 2/3 each (booth on the back). There is more seating outside.Even when lines get long, the food comes out fast and hot. The staff are extremely friendly. There's Tapatio and tobasco and other bottles hot sauces available if you dine in."
50,Came here after a wedding and the guys that work here followed us out to our car and took pictures of our license plate as we were trying to leave. They were accusing us of knowing somebody else who they thought hit their truck. Not only will we not be back but we will be following up with this issue as this was completely uncalled for. One of the workers wanted to fight us. That's not how you run a business.
51,"This place has great food. The menu is huge, and reasonably priced. Their breakfast burritos are on point! The food is mixed traditional, authentic Mexican food as well as MexicanAmerican food (burritos, nachos).Everybody here is pretty friendly,  and I think just about everything they make is made from scratch. While you can get your food to go, this is not a ""fast-food"" restaurant, really. It could be fun to sit down there also, there's lots of tables inside and outside. A majority of the food is fresh and made to order and comes out piping-hot off the grill. Don't confuse this with some local Berkeley Taco Bell. Mission is legit, awesome, awesome food."
52,"Hands down the best Mexican food in Berkeley. The mole poblano burrito, either with chicken or carnitas is excellent, and the platanos and beans are awesome. But let me reiterate- do not miss out on the amazing mole here!!!Casual atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating, in a quiet area of Berkeley far from the university. Food is delivered to your table quickly, service is nothing outstanding, but good enough.Food is priced well for how much food you get- I paid a bit over $10 for a burrito that's probably going to keep me full for two days lolol"
53,"We had a good experience at La Mission this afternoon. We ordered tacos de papa, cocktail, and tacos de Barbacoa. Tacos were delicious, cocktail filling, lots of shrimp. Juice and sangria were so so. But overall good experience. Fresh breeze, out door  seating and friendly staff!"
54,"Super awesome taqueria right on the main drag of university avenue.They have their own small parking lot behind the building accessible via chestnut st. in addition to the usual street parking. Usually there's a spot or two available at any given time, although the super popular lunch rush can be very busy.There is pleasing inside and outside seating. The outside seating is larger then most places of this type, and is particularly nice on a sunny day, what with the natural shade provided by several friendly trees. Inside seating is the usual booth/chair combos al fast food restaurant style.  the look of the place scream re-purposed fast food chain to me, but the owners have made it all their own local styling, even if the inside is dominated by the order counter.Service  is of the order and pick up when called model. The menu consists of the usual taqueria suspects-burrito, taco, combo platters with slightly more variety. They offer the full range of meats including barbacoa, lengua, camarón (shrimp) and several different varieties of fish. There are also three different stylings of veg burrito/tacos including vegan and grilled veg options, which is nice to see. The breakfast menu is especially strong, and they have an awesome salsa/condiment bar.  Pricing for these items is fairly standard for the area about three bucks a taco and everything else pretty much starts at 7 bucks. Typically a meal will run about ten dollars with a drink and add ons, but it's possible to go the bare bones bargain route for slightly less. It's the flavor, convenience, and quality of the food that really shines here.One of the better lunch/breakfast options for the area for sure."
55,"Solid, good, authentic mexican food.   Whether you want tacos, enchiladas, tortas, burritos, pozole, etc., this place does not disappoint.Highly recommend for the price and the service.  There is also a parking lot and great outdoor seating."
56,I have frequently passed by this place but never gave it any thought to stop by but with the recommendation we decided to stop in for lunch I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and good this place actually was Food: grilled chicken tacos & steak (good) blk beans & rice everything was fresh the food was heavy which I liked and I like the way the meat  was cut into small pieces because I definitely dislike big chunks of meat with a lot of fat Service: fastAmbience: gives u a little feel of a little taqueria in Mexico Conclusion: better than I thought I will definitely return I love their chicken tacos and their rice and beans everything was fresh very tasty very good light and healthy I would say give this place a try
57,"Taco Trek Lesson 3, THE TORTILLA. The CORN tortilla is the double-layered  backbone of the taco experience, setting the tone for moisture and texture throughout the bite. The flavor of the corn is the floor upon which the flavors of the meat, fat, and toppings dance the Salsa! When talk-talking tacos, there are two types of corn tortillas to consider: fresh-made and factory-made.* Fresh tortillas are rare. If you're lucky enough to find tortillas rolled out ON-THE-SPOT from a press, quality is a WRAP! Fresh corn tortillas are always perfectly moist and tender, and need minimal added fat. The experience is like eating supple wontons or dumplings; the fresh tortilla is as pliable as soft cloth, and the corn never wads up into dry unpleasantness in the back of your mouth. Fresh tortillas, however, have zero shelf-life, and thus we get to...* Factory tortillas, which are common. Tortillas made in a factory have added preservatives and binding agents that make them dense, dry, and disgusting -- but they can be made awesome again through the absorption of enough fat on a hot griddle! Simply steaming factory tortillas is UNACCEPTABLE to a tacossieur like me, because they get doughy and taste acidic. Automatic Taco Fail!* Pro-tip: You can tell the QUALITY of a corn tortilla just from a TACO PHOTO. :::: Positively Awesome: 1) Round corners at the folds, 2) Oil-stained, deep color, 3) some shine on the surface -- tender and moist, let's rejoice! 4) Greased spots of golden-brown -- crisped on the griddle to be chewy in the middle!:::: God-Awful: 1) Sharp corners at the folded edges -- MEH, mostly dry. 2) Light-colored, dry-looking surface -- cotton-mouth! Keep away! 3) Wet, doughy-looking surface (sure sign of gringo tacos) -- acidic YUCKTOWN._______ Strictly a review of La Mission's TACOS _______Tacos were sadly MEH-diocre. I suspect the overall 4-star review was was given by burrito-eaters that are HIGHLY FORGIVING of crappy meats. Time to take a BART ride to the Fruitvale for some real-deal taco trucks, my Gringos. Check out my TACO TREK LIST to get you started.3   M I N U S E S- FAILS de CARNESRemember, tacos are all about delivering delicious MEAT-DECADENCE into your mouth. No hiding the flavor of the meat with cheese, lettuce, beans, rice, guac, cream, etc. Pureza means PURITY!:::: Borrego -- MEH-EH-EH-EH. Lamb Barbacoa was gamy and dry. The marinade was decent, but not enough to rescue the meat. I had one bite of LAMB FAT that was great, though.:::: Al Pastor -- MEH'VERAGE. All around dry, barely tasted any pork fat. The shallow marinade tasted like mild Tapatio.:::: Carnitas -- GAR'MEHGE. Chipotle-vels of CarMEHtas failure. Didn't even taste like pork. More of a dry, cotton-mouthed protein filler. Awful.- BORED-TILLAS:::: Tortillas -- NEED LOTION. Dry, and in need of moisturizing from some oil. After 4 minutes, these unlotioned tortillas absorbed too much moisture, thus becoming doughy in places, and pretty gross. Folks who prefer flour tortillas to corn tortillas do so because of tortillas LIKE THESE.- GRINGOFIED MENUMeat quality is automatically suspect if certain authentic and standard carnes aren't on the menu: no cabeza, no lengua, no tripe... This probably means that the clientele is inexperienced, and thus these delicacies will go unordered. This probably also means that the meats that are on the menu aren't going to be that awesome because the aforementioned inexperienced clientele will not demand quality.2   S T A R S* STEAK'ED THEIR CLAIM:::: Carne Asada Taco -- PURDY GOOD. Although the morsels alone seemed dry, biting into a mouthful of steak produced lovely moisture, and smoky flavor.*(1/2) BRIGHT-EYED SERVICEWelcoming, attentive, and bright-eyed friendliness from everyone I interacted with. Thank you so much guys!*(1/2) LOVELY OUTDOOR SPACEBring your beer to the pretty lil outdoor space with a trellis for shade, and enough tables to seat about 20."
58,"I understand from friends that the meat options are tasty, but the veggie and fish burritos and tacos I've had here were poor.The staff are always friendly, and you get nice thick chips, but nothing else has been good the three times I've visited."
59,I am no Mexican food expert but I thought their burrito was solid. I had a plain old vegetarian burrito without any extras like sour cream or guacamole and I also didn't get cheese. They give you a choice of black beans or refried. I super love their salsa offerings. The tomatillo salsa and the other one (I can't remember which) are both delicious and I totally drowned every bite of my burrito with both.The burrito itself was huge but was the perfect thing after I was famished from climbing. Definitely better than Monte Cristo up the street!
60,"TL;DR 5/5 carnitas tacosCame here during dinner time, line was not too bad. I ordered 3 tacos, carnitas, carne asada, and another something taco. The sauce, cilantro, onion, everything was the perfect taste and ratio. My favorite was the carnitas, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. They have a wide variety of items on their menu, and I will definitely be back to try the rest!This is my friend's top taco place in Berkeley, and I would also put this at the top of my list.La Mission is accessible via AC Transit 51B or car (small parking lot in the back)."
61,How come my simple to-go order can't be prepared correctly? Is asking for pico de gallo too complicated? I'm tired of getting home to find out that my food was made incorrectly. I try to keep any additions simple. I think I forgot why I like La Mission. I'm finished hoping you'll get my order right.
62,"we got off our night shift and went here for breakfast. There was no wait time at all, the restaurant just opened for the day. we were first customers. restaurant was very clean. There was a breakfast menu and we could order from full menu. we also ordered pitcher of sangria - which was  great.4 star for food. felt like food was cooked quick, slightly undercooked. 5 star for service. Will def stop by here for more food"
63,"I so wanted breakfast, My meeting ran late so I had to settle for the tacos. The grilled fish taco was good. The Tacos al pastor were ok. Not great although not bad. Tortillas are small although they make up for the amount of meat they put on. Salsa did not have much flavor. The staff was friendly and I will be back for the breakfast."
64,"Best spot in Berkeley for Mexican food.  My favorite is the baja fish taco, $5.50.  I thought it was expensive for one taco but it is huge!  They give a generous serving of fish, crema, cabbage, and tomatoes.  I love the breading of the fish, giving a nice crispy texture with moist fish inside, and the crema makes for a great flavor combo.  Delish!The horchata is really sweet, but becomes perfect when the ice melts.  This place has got friendly staff, a great vibe, is clean, has outside garden seating, and also boasts a parking lot in the back to top it off (no Berkeley street parking necessary)."
65,"Service was efficient and friendly, but La Mission's chicken dishes leave everything to be desired. If you eat pork, they have your back (the pozole for example), but the chicken is literally tiny dry cubes of meat with no flavor. I spent 17$ and change on two street tacos a small salad and one beer. Seemed outrageously high relative to the quality and amount of food. Maybe the other tacos are just so much more delicious? If I were them I would pull all the cubed chicken off the menu. The green salad was good, though sparse. I liked that it had pepitas, cabbage shreds and a vinaigrette dressing. Not sure I would come back just for that though with so many other amazing Mexican places around the area. Sad because I really wanted to love this place!"

One of the workers wanted to fight us. That's not how you run a business.
91,"This place has great food. The menu is huge, and reasonably priced. Their breakfast burritos are on point! The food is mixed traditional, authentic Mexican food as well as MexicanAmerican food (burritos, nachos).Everybody here is pretty friendly,  and I think just about everything they make is made from scratch. While you can get your food to go, this is not a ""fast-food"" restaurant, really. It could be fun to sit down there also, there's lots of tables inside and outside. A majority of the food is fresh and made to order and comes out piping-hot off the grill. Don't confuse this with some local Berkeley Taco Bell. Mission is legit, awesome, awesome food."
92,"Hands down the best Mexican food in Berkeley. The mole poblano burrito, either with chicken or carnitas is excellent, and the platanos and beans are awesome. But let me reiterate- do not miss out on the amazing mole here!!!Casual atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating, in a quiet area of Berkeley far from the university. Food is delivered to your table quickly, service is nothing outstanding, but good enough.Food is priced well for how much food you get- I paid a bit over $10 for a burrito that's probably going to keep me full for two days lolol"
93,"We had a good experience at La Mission this afternoon. We ordered tacos de papa, cocktail, and tacos de Barbacoa. Tacos were delicious, cocktail filling, lots of shrimp. Juice and sangria were so so. But overall good experience. Fresh breeze, out door  seating and friendly staff!"
94,"Super awesome taqueria right on the main drag of university avenue.They have their own small parking lot behind the building accessible via chestnut st. in addition to the usual street parking. Usually there's a spot or two available at any given time, although the super popular lunch rush can be very busy.There is pleasing inside and outside seating. The outside seating is larger then most places of this type, and is particularly nice on a sunny day, what with the natural shade provided by several friendly trees. Inside seating is the usual booth/chair combos al fast food restaurant style.  the look of the place scream re-purposed fast food chain to me, but the owners have made it all their own local styling, even if the inside is dominated by the order counter.Service  is of the order and pick up when called model. The menu consists of the usual taqueria suspects-burrito, taco, combo platters with slightly more variety. They offer the full range of meats including barbacoa, lengua, camarón (shrimp) and several different varieties of fish. There are also three different stylings of veg burrito/tacos including vegan and grilled veg options, which is nice to see. The breakfast menu is especially strong, and they have an awesome salsa/condiment bar.  Pricing for these items is fairly standard for the area about three bucks a taco and everything else pretty much starts at 7 bucks. Typically a meal will run about ten dollars with a drink and add ons, but it's possible to go the bare bones bargain route for slightly less. It's the flavor, convenience, and quality of the food that really shines here.One of the better lunch/breakfast options for the area for sure."
95,"Solid, good, authentic mexican food.   Whether you want tacos, enchiladas, tortas, burritos, pozole, etc., this place does not disappoint.Highly recommend for the price and the service.  There is also a parking lot and great outdoor seating."
96,I have frequently passed by this place but never gave it any thought to stop by but with the recommendation we decided to stop in for lunch I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and good this place actually was Food: grilled chicken tacos & steak (good) blk beans & rice everything was fresh the food was heavy which I liked and I like the way the meat  was cut into small pieces because I definitely dislike big chunks of meat with a lot of fat Service: fastAmbience: gives u a little feel of a little taqueria in Mexico Conclusion: better than I thought I will definitely return I love their chicken tacos and their rice and beans everything was fresh very tasty very good light and healthy I would say give this place a try
97,"Taco Trek Lesson 3, THE TORTILLA. The CORN tortilla is the double-layered  backbone of the taco experience, setting the tone for moisture and texture throughout the bite. The flavor of the corn is the floor upon which the flavors of the meat, fat, and toppings dance the Salsa! When talk-talking tacos, there are two types of corn tortillas to consider: fresh-made and factory-made.* Fresh tortillas are rare. If you're lucky enough to find tortillas rolled out ON-THE-SPOT from a press, quality is a WRAP! Fresh corn tortillas are always perfectly moist and tender, and need minimal added fat. The experience is like eating supple wontons or dumplings; the fresh tortilla is as pliable as soft cloth, and the corn never wads up into dry unpleasantness in the back of your mouth. Fresh tortillas, however, have zero shelf-life, and thus we get to...* Factory tortillas, which are common. Tortillas made in a factory have added preservatives and binding agents that make them dense, dry, and disgusting -- but they can be made awesome again through the absorption of enough fat on a hot griddle! Simply steaming factory tortillas is UNACCEPTABLE to a tacossieur like me, because they get doughy and taste acidic. Automatic Taco Fail!* Pro-tip: You can tell the QUALITY of a corn tortilla just from a TACO PHOTO. :::: Positively Awesome: 1) Round corners at the folds, 2) Oil-stained, deep color, 3) some shine on the surface -- tender and moist, let's rejoice! 4) Greased spots of golden-brown -- crisped on the griddle to be chewy in the middle!:::: God-Awful: 1) Sharp corners at the folded edges -- MEH, mostly dry. 2) Light-colored, dry-looking surface -- cotton-mouth! Keep away! 3) Wet, doughy-looking surface (sure sign of gringo tacos) -- acidic YUCKTOWN._______ Strictly a review of La Mission's TACOS _______Tacos were sadly MEH-diocre. I suspect the overall 4-star review was was given by burrito-eaters that are HIGHLY FORGIVING of crappy meats. Time to take a BART ride to the Fruitvale for some real-deal taco trucks, my Gringos. Check out my TACO TREK LIST to get you started.3   M I N U S E S- FAILS de CARNESRemember, tacos are all about delivering delicious MEAT-DECADENCE into your mouth. No hiding the flavor of the meat with cheese, lettuce, beans, rice, guac, cream, etc. Pureza means PURITY!:::: Borrego -- MEH-EH-EH-EH. Lamb Barbacoa was gamy and dry. The marinade was decent, but not enough to rescue the meat. I had one bite of LAMB FAT that was great, though.:::: Al Pastor -- MEH'VERAGE. All around dry, barely tasted any pork fat. The shallow marinade tasted like mild Tapatio.:::: Carnitas -- GAR'MEHGE. Chipotle-vels of CarMEHtas failure. Didn't even taste like pork. More of a dry, cotton-mouthed protein filler. Awful.- BORED-TILLAS:::: Tortillas -- NEED LOTION. Dry, and in need of moisturizing from some oil. After 4 minutes, these unlotioned tortillas absorbed too much moisture, thus becoming doughy in places, and pretty gross. Folks who prefer flour tortillas to corn tortillas do so because of tortillas LIKE THESE.- GRINGOFIED MENUMeat quality is automatically suspect if certain authentic and standard carnes aren't on the menu: no cabeza, no lengua, no tripe... This probably means that the clientele is inexperienced, and thus these delicacies will go unordered. This probably also means that the meats that are on the menu aren't going to be that awesome because the aforementioned inexperienced clientele will not demand quality.2   S T A R S* STEAK'ED THEIR CLAIM:::: Carne Asada Taco -- PURDY GOOD. Although the morsels alone seemed dry, biting into a mouthful of steak produced lovely moisture, and smoky flavor.*(1/2) BRIGHT-EYED SERVICEWelcoming, attentive, and bright-eyed friendliness from everyone I interacted with. Thank you so much guys!*(1/2) LOVELY OUTDOOR SPACEBring your beer to the pretty lil outdoor space with a trellis for shade, and enough tables to seat about 20."
98,"I understand from friends that the meat options are tasty, but the veggie and fish burritos and tacos I've had here were poor.The staff are always friendly, and you get nice thick chips, but nothing else has been good the three times I've visited."
99,I am no Mexican food expert but I thought their burrito was solid. I had a plain old vegetarian burrito without any extras like sour cream or guacamole and I also didn't get cheese. They give you a choice of black beans or refried. I super love their salsa offerings. The tomatillo salsa and the other one (I can't remember which) are both delicious and I totally drowned every bite of my burrito with both.The burrito itself was huge but was the perfect thing after I was famished from climbing. Definitely better than Monte Cristo up the street!
100,"TL;DR 5/5 carnitas tacosCame here during dinner time, line was not too bad. I ordered 3 tacos, carnitas, carne asada, and another something taco. The sauce, cilantro, onion, everything was the perfect taste and ratio. My favorite was the carnitas, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. They have a wide variety of items on their menu, and I will definitely be back to try the rest!This is my friend's top taco place in Berkeley, and I would also put this at the top of my list.La Mission is accessible via AC Transit 51B or car (small parking lot in the back)."
101,How come my simple to-go order can't be prepared correctly? Is asking for pico de gallo too complicated? I'm tired of getting home to find out that my food was made incorrectly. I try to keep any additions simple. I think I forgot why I like La Mission. I'm finished hoping you'll get my order right.
102,"we got off our night shift and went here for breakfast. There was no wait time at all, the restaurant just opened for the day. we were first customers. restaurant was very clean. There was a breakfast menu and we could order from full menu. we also ordered pitcher of sangria - which was  great.4 star for food. felt like food was cooked quick, slightly undercooked. 5 star for service. Will def stop by here for more food"
103,"I so wanted breakfast, My meeting ran late so I had to settle for the tacos. The grilled fish taco was good. The Tacos al pastor were ok. Not great although not bad. Tortillas are small although they make up for the amount of meat they put on. Salsa did not have much flavor. The staff was friendly and I will be back for the breakfast."
104,"Best spot in Berkeley for Mexican food.  My favorite is the baja fish taco, $5.50.  I thought it was expensive for one taco but it is huge!  They give a generous serving of fish, crema, cabbage, and tomatoes.  I love the breading of the fish, giving a nice crispy texture with moist fish inside, and the crema makes for a great flavor combo.  Delish!The horchata is really sweet, but becomes perfect when the ice melts.  This place has got friendly staff, a great vibe, is clean, has outside garden seating, and also boasts a parking lot in the back to top it off (no Berkeley street parking necessary)."
105,"Service was efficient and friendly, but La Mission's chicken dishes leave everything to be desired. If you eat pork, they have your back (the pozole for example), but the chicken is literally tiny dry cubes of meat with no flavor. I spent 17$ and change on two street tacos a small salad and one beer. Seemed outrageously high relative to the quality and amount of food. Maybe the other tacos are just so much more delicious? If I were them I would pull all the cubed chicken off the menu. The green salad was good, though sparse. I liked that it had pepitas, cabbage shreds and a vinaigrette dressing. Not sure I would come back just for that though with so many other amazing Mexican places around the area. Sad because I really wanted to love this place!"
106,"This is by far my favorite taco place in the bay area!The grand tacos here has 2 shells (1 soft 1 hard) and has more fillings than normal tacos. I normally go for the beef and the fish taco while my husband will have these 2 and a pork one as well. The fish is always crispy outside and tender inside, with a light dressing to compliment the flavor. The beef taco doesn't skim on the beef quantity like a lot other places. We also like the nachos here. In fact it is the favorite dish for my mother who comes from China. The service is slightly slow here but that's because they make everything fresh. It's a wait I'm willing to have for good quality food。"
107,Best Mexican food in Berkeley. Really really fresh meats and diverse vegetarian choices. Excellent moles and savory menudo. Perfect snacking for a summer afternoon.
108,"Mission Accomplished. Decent Mexican food found in Berkeley!Food: Have your pick from tacos to burritos, soups, entree plates, aguas frescas and even some fresh desserts if you're sweet tooth kicks in. I went with a simple and classic cheesy quesadilla, but added prawns to fancy it up a bit. Oozing with cheesy, grilled to near perfection and boasting with fresh flavors of chopped prawns; it was truly delicious. My friend ordered the Al Pastor Burrito which was packed with some of the best marinated and juicy chunks of meat we've ever had, he ordered it with everything, both of us were surprised the burrito didn't fall apart upon first bite. It was the perfect blend of fresh and savory ingredients all enclosed in a grilled and slightly charred flour tortilla. The salsa was the only issue as it wasn't nearly as spicy nor fresh as I hoped for. Chips are not free, that was a bummer as well. Other than that, the food was solid.Price: A bit steeper than your average casual Mexican eatery, but worth the price. Ambiance: Cozy and small interior, very tight and minimal seating, but they do have a huge outdoor patio equipped with tons of natural shading from the big trees. Parking lot is behind the building.Service: The young man that took our order greeted us with a genuine smile and was very patient. Same story with the young man that brought us our food.Overall: I was getting a bit tired of driving to Oakland for Mexican food, so I'm glad I finally found fresh and decent tasting Mexican food in Berkeley. Prices are a bit steeper than I'd like, but well worth the solid tasting food and wonderful service."
109,"I've come here several times and have had great experiences each time. Be it afternoon, evening, or night, this place has fantastic service and wonderful food.Tonight hubs and I had a beer each while waiting for our order (Santa Fe salad and chile rellenos). The total came to $36 and I tipped up to $42. Seating inside is 8 small-ish tables that seat 2/3 each (booth on the back). There is more seating outside.Even when lines get long, the food comes out fast and hot. The staff are extremely friendly. There's Tapatio and tobasco and other bottles hot sauces available if you dine in."

136,I have frequently passed by this place but never gave it any thought to stop by but with the recommendation we decided to stop in for lunch I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and good this place actually was Food: grilled chicken tacos & steak (good) blk beans & rice everything was fresh the food was heavy which I liked and I like the way the meat  was cut into small pieces because I definitely dislike big chunks of meat with a lot of fat Service: fastAmbience: gives u a little feel of a little taqueria in Mexico Conclusion: better than I thought I will definitely return I love their chicken tacos and their rice and beans everything was fresh very tasty very good light and healthy I would say give this place a try
137,"Taco Trek Lesson 3, THE TORTILLA. The CORN tortilla is the double-layered  backbone of the taco experience, setting the tone for moisture and texture throughout the bite. The flavor of the corn is the floor upon which the flavors of the meat, fat, and toppings dance the Salsa! When talk-talking tacos, there are two types of corn tortillas to consider: fresh-made and factory-made.* Fresh tortillas are rare. If you're lucky enough to find tortillas rolled out ON-THE-SPOT from a press, quality is a WRAP! Fresh corn tortillas are always perfectly moist and tender, and need minimal added fat. The experience is like eating supple wontons or dumplings; the fresh tortilla is as pliable as soft cloth, and the corn never wads up into dry unpleasantness in the back of your mouth. Fresh tortillas, however, have zero shelf-life, and thus we get to...* Factory tortillas, which are common. Tortillas made in a factory have added preservatives and binding agents that make them dense, dry, and disgusting -- but they can be made awesome again through the absorption of enough fat on a hot griddle! Simply steaming factory tortillas is UNACCEPTABLE to a tacossieur like me, because they get doughy and taste acidic. Automatic Taco Fail!* Pro-tip: You can tell the QUALITY of a corn tortilla just from a TACO PHOTO. :::: Positively Awesome: 1) Round corners at the folds, 2) Oil-stained, deep color, 3) some shine on the surface -- tender and moist, let's rejoice! 4) Greased spots of golden-brown -- crisped on the griddle to be chewy in the middle!:::: God-Awful: 1) Sharp corners at the folded edges -- MEH, mostly dry. 2) Light-colored, dry-looking surface -- cotton-mouth!

I suspect the overall 4-star review was was given by burrito-eaters that are HIGHLY FORGIVING of crappy meats. Time to take a BART ride to the Fruitvale for some real-deal taco trucks, my Gringos. Check out my TACO TREK LIST to get you started.3   M I N U S E S- FAILS de CARNESRemember, tacos are all about delivering delicious MEAT-DECADENCE into your mouth. No hiding the flavor of the meat with cheese, lettuce, beans, rice, guac, cream, etc. Pureza means PURITY!:::: Borrego -- MEH-EH-EH-EH. Lamb Barbacoa was gamy and dry. The marinade was decent, but not enough to rescue the meat. I had one bite of LAMB FAT that was great, though.:::: Al Pastor -- MEH'VERAGE. All around dry, barely tasted any pork fat. The shallow marinade tasted like mild Tapatio.:::: Carnitas -- GAR'MEHGE. Chipotle-vels of CarMEHtas failure. Didn't even taste like pork. More of a dry, cotton-mouthed protein filler. Awful.- BORED-TILLAS:::: Tortillas -- NEED LOTION. Dry, and in need of moisturizing from some oil. After 4 minutes, these unlotioned tortillas absorbed too much moisture, thus becoming doughy in places, and pretty gross. Folks who prefer flour tortillas to corn tortillas do so because of tortillas LIKE THESE.- GRINGOFIED MENUMeat quality is automatically suspect if certain authentic and standard carnes aren't on the menu: no cabeza, no lengua, no tripe... This probably means that the clientele is inexperienced, and thus these delicacies will go unordered. This probably also means that the meats that are on the menu aren't going to be that awesome because the aforementioned inexperienced clientele will not demand quality.2   S T A R S* STEAK'ED THEIR CLAIM:::: Carne Asada Taco -- PURDY GOOD.

138,"I understand from friends that the meat options are tasty, but the veggie and fish burritos and tacos I've had here were poor.The staff are always friendly, and you get nice thick chips, but nothing else has been good the three times I've visited."
139,I am no Mexican food expert but I thought their burrito was solid. I had a plain old vegetarian burrito without any extras like sour cream or guacamole and I also didn't get cheese. They give you a choice of black beans or refried. I super love their salsa offerings. The tomatillo salsa and the other one (I can't remember which) are both delicious and I totally drowned every bite of my burrito with both.The burrito itself was huge but was the perfect thing after I was famished from climbing. Definitely better than Monte Cristo up the street!
140,"TL;DR 5/5 carnitas tacosCame here during dinner time, line was not too bad. I ordered 3 tacos, carnitas, carne asada, and another something taco. The sauce, cilantro, onion, everything was the perfect taste and ratio. My favorite was the carnitas, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. They have a wide variety of items on their menu, and I will definitely be back to try the rest!This is my friend's top taco place in Berkeley, and I would also put this at the top of my list.La Mission is accessible via AC Transit 51B or car (small parking lot in the back)."
141,How come my simple to-go order can't be prepared correctly? Is asking for pico de gallo too complicated? I'm tired of getting home to find out that my food was made incorrectly. I try to keep any additions simple. I think I forgot why I like La Mission. I'm finished hoping you'll get my order right.
142,"we got off our night shift and went here for breakfast. There was no wait time at all, the restaurant just opened for the day. we were first customers. restaurant was very clean. There was a breakfast menu and we could order from full menu. we also ordered pitcher of sangria - which was  great.4 star for food. felt like food was cooked quick, slightly undercooked. 5 star for service. Will def stop by here for more food"
143,"I so wanted breakfast, My meeting ran late so I had to settle for the tacos. The grilled fish taco was good. The Tacos al pastor were ok. Not great although not bad. Tortillas are small although they make up for the amount of meat they put on. Salsa did not have much flavor. The staff was friendly and I will be back for the breakfast."
144,"Best spot in Berkeley for Mexican food.  My favorite is the baja fish taco, $5.50.  I thought it was expensive for one taco but it is huge!  They give a generous serving of fish, crema, cabbage, and tomatoes.  I love the breading of the fish, giving a nice crispy texture with moist fish inside, and the crema makes for a great flavor combo.  Delish!The horchata is really sweet, but becomes perfect when the ice melts.  This place has got friendly staff, a great vibe, is clean, has outside garden seating, and also boasts a parking lot in the back to top it off (no Berkeley street parking necessary)."
145,"Service was efficient and friendly, but La Mission's chicken dishes leave everything to be desired. If you eat pork, they have your back (the pozole for example), but the chicken is literally tiny dry cubes of meat with no flavor. I spent 17$ and change on two street tacos a small salad and one beer. Seemed outrageously high relative to the quality and amount of food. Maybe the other tacos are just so much more delicious? If I were them I would pull all the cubed chicken off the menu. The green salad was good, though sparse. I liked that it had pepitas, cabbage shreds and a vinaigrette dressing. Not sure I would come back just for that though with so many other amazing Mexican places around the area. Sad because I really wanted to love this place!"
146,"This is by far my favorite taco place in the bay area!The grand tacos here has 2 shells (1 soft 1 hard) and has more fillings than normal tacos. I normally go for the beef and the fish taco while my husband will have these 2 and a pork one as well. The fish is always crispy outside and tender inside, with a light dressing to compliment the flavor. The beef taco doesn't skim on the beef quantity like a lot other places. We also like the nachos here. In fact it is the favorite dish for my mother who comes from China. The service is slightly slow here but that's because they make everything fresh. It's a wait I'm willing to have for good quality food。"
147,Best Mexican food in Berkeley. Really really fresh meats and diverse vegetarian choices. Excellent moles and savory menudo. Perfect snacking for a summer afternoon.
148,"Mission Accomplished. Decent Mexican food found in Berkeley!Food: Have your pick from tacos to burritos, soups, entree plates, aguas frescas and even some fresh desserts if you're sweet tooth kicks in. I went with a simple and classic cheesy quesadilla, but added prawns to fancy it up a bit. Oozing with cheesy, grilled to near perfection and boasting with fresh flavors of chopped prawns; it was truly delicious. My friend ordered the Al Pastor Burrito which was packed with some of the best marinated and juicy chunks of meat we've ever had, he ordered it with everything, both of us were surprised the burrito didn't fall apart upon first bite. It was the perfect blend of fresh and savory ingredients all enclosed in a grilled and slightly charred flour tortilla. The salsa was the only issue as it wasn't nearly as spicy nor fresh as I hoped for. Chips are not free, that was a bummer as well. Other than that, the food was solid.Price: A bit steeper than your average casual Mexican eatery, but worth the price. Ambiance: Cozy and small interior, very tight and minimal seating, but they do have a huge outdoor patio equipped with tons of natural shading from the big trees. Parking lot is behind the building.Service: The young man that took our order greeted us with a genuine smile and was very patient. Same story with the young man that brought us our food.Overall: I was getting a bit tired of driving to Oakland for Mexican food, so I'm glad I finally found fresh and decent tasting Mexican food in Berkeley. Prices are a bit steeper than I'd like, but well worth the solid tasting food and wonderful service."
149,"I've come here several times and have had great experiences each time. Be it afternoon, evening, or night, this place has fantastic service and wonderful food.Tonight hubs and I had a beer each while waiting for our order (Santa Fe salad and chile rellenos). The total came to $36 and I tipped up to $42. Seating inside is 8 small-ish tables that seat 2/3 each (booth on the back). There is more seating outside.Even when lines get long, the food comes out fast and hot. The staff are extremely friendly. There's Tapatio and tobasco and other bottles hot sauces available if you dine in."
150,Came here after a wedding and the guys that work here followed us out to our car and took pictures of our license plate as we were trying to leave. They were accusing us of knowing somebody else who they thought hit their truck. Not only will we not be back but we will be following up with this issue as this was completely uncalled for. One of the workers wanted to fight us. That's not how you run a business.
151,"This place has great food. The menu is huge, and reasonably priced. Their breakfast burritos are on point! The food is mixed traditional, authentic Mexican food as well as MexicanAmerican food (burritos, nachos).Everybody here is pretty friendly,  and I think just about everything they make is made from scratch. While you can get your food to go, this is not a ""fast-food"" restaurant, really. It could be fun to sit down there also, there's lots of tables inside and outside. A majority of the food is fresh and made to order and comes out piping-hot off the grill. Don't confuse this with some local Berkeley Taco Bell. Mission is legit, awesome, awesome food."
152,"Hands down the best Mexican food in Berkeley. The mole poblano burrito, either with chicken or carnitas is excellent, and the platanos and beans are awesome. But let me reiterate- do not miss out on the amazing mole here!!!Casual atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating, in a quiet area of Berkeley far from the university. Food is delivered to your table quickly, service is nothing outstanding, but good enough.Food is priced well for how much food you get- I paid a bit over $10 for a burrito that's probably going to keep me full for two days lolol"
153,"We had a good experience at La Mission this afternoon. We ordered tacos de papa, cocktail, and tacos de Barbacoa. Tacos were delicious, cocktail filling, lots of shrimp. Juice and sangria were so so. But overall good experience. Fresh breeze, out door  seating and friendly staff!"

178,"I understand from friends that the meat options are tasty, but the veggie and fish burritos and tacos I've had here were poor.The staff are always friendly, and you get nice thick chips, but nothing else has been good the three times I've visited."
179,I am no Mexican food expert but I thought their burrito was solid. I had a plain old vegetarian burrito without any extras like sour cream or guacamole and I also didn't get cheese. They give you a choice of black beans or refried. I super love their salsa offerings. The tomatillo salsa and the other one (I can't remember which) are both delicious and I totally drowned every bite of my burrito with both.The burrito itself was huge but was the perfect thing after I was famished from climbing. Definitely better than Monte Cristo up the street!
180,"TL;DR 5/5 carnitas tacosCame here during dinner time, line was not too bad. I ordered 3 tacos, carnitas, carne asada, and another something taco. The sauce, cilantro, onion, everything was the perfect taste and ratio. My favorite was the carnitas, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. They have a wide variety of items on their menu, and I will definitely be back to try the rest!This is my friend's top taco place in Berkeley, and I would also put this at the top of my list.La Mission is accessible via AC Transit 51B or car (small parking lot in the back)."
181,How come my simple to-go order can't be prepared correctly? Is asking for pico de gallo too complicated? I'm tired of getting home to find out that my food was made incorrectly. I try to keep any additions simple. I think I forgot why I like La Mission. I'm finished hoping you'll get my order right.
182,"we got off our night shift and went here for breakfast. There was no wait time at all, the restaurant just opened for the day. we were first customers. restaurant was very clean. There was a breakfast menu and we could order from full menu. we also ordered pitcher of sangria - which was  great.4 star for food. felt like food was cooked quick, slightly undercooked. 5 star for service. Will def stop by here for more food"
183,"I so wanted breakfast, My meeting ran late so I had to settle for the tacos. The grilled fish taco was good. The Tacos al pastor were ok. Not great although not bad. Tortillas are small although they make up for the amount of meat they put on. Salsa did not have much flavor. The staff was friendly and I will be back for the breakfast."
184,"Best spot in Berkeley for Mexican food.  My favorite is the baja fish taco, $5.50.  I thought it was expensive for one taco but it is huge!  They give a generous serving of fish, crema, cabbage, and tomatoes.  I love the breading of the fish, giving a nice crispy texture with moist fish inside, and the crema makes for a great flavor combo.  Delish!The horchata is really sweet, but becomes perfect when the ice melts.  This place has got friendly staff, a great vibe, is clean, has outside garden seating, and also boasts a parking lot in the back to top it off (no Berkeley street parking necessary)."
185,"Service was efficient and friendly, but La Mission's chicken dishes leave everything to be desired. If you eat pork, they have your back (the pozole for example), but the chicken is literally tiny dry cubes of meat with no flavor. I spent 17$ and change on two street tacos a small salad and one beer. Seemed outrageously high relative to the quality and amount of food. Maybe the other tacos are just so much more delicious? If I were them I would pull all the cubed chicken off the menu. The green salad was good, though sparse. I liked that it had pepitas, cabbage shreds and a vinaigrette dressing. Not sure I would come back just for that though with so many other amazing Mexican places around the area. Sad because I really wanted to love this place!"
186,"This is by far my favorite taco place in the bay area!The grand tacos here has 2 shells (1 soft 1 hard) and has more fillings than normal tacos. I normally go for the beef and the fish taco while my husband will have these 2 and a pork one as well. The fish is always crispy outside and tender inside, with a light dressing to compliment the flavor. The beef taco doesn't skim on the beef quantity like a lot other places. We also like the nachos here. In fact it is the favorite dish for my mother who comes from China. The service is slightly slow here but that's because they make everything fresh. It's a wait I'm willing to have for good quality food。"
187,Best Mexican food in Berkeley. Really really fresh meats and diverse vegetarian choices. Excellent moles and savory menudo. Perfect snacking for a summer afternoon.
188,"Mission Accomplished. Decent Mexican food found in Berkeley!Food: Have your pick from tacos to burritos, soups, entree plates, aguas frescas and even some fresh desserts if you're sweet tooth kicks in. I went with a simple and classic cheesy quesadilla, but added prawns to fancy it up a bit. Oozing with cheesy, grilled to near perfection and boasting with fresh flavors of chopped prawns; it was truly delicious. My friend ordered the Al Pastor Burrito which was packed with some of the best marinated and juicy chunks of meat we've ever had, he ordered it with everything, both of us were surprised the burrito didn't fall apart upon first bite. It was the perfect blend of fresh and savory ingredients all enclosed in a grilled and slightly charred flour tortilla. The salsa was the only issue as it wasn't nearly as spicy nor fresh as I hoped for. Chips are not free, that was a bummer as well. Other than that, the food was solid.Price: A bit steeper than your average casual Mexican eatery, but worth the price. Ambiance: Cozy and small interior, very tight and minimal seating, but they do have a huge outdoor patio equipped with tons of natural shading from the big trees. Parking lot is behind the building.Service: The young man that took our order greeted us with a genuine smile and was very patient. Same story with the young man that brought us our food.Overall: I was getting a bit tired of driving to Oakland for Mexican food, so I'm glad I finally found fresh and decent tasting Mexican food in Berkeley. Prices are a bit steeper than I'd like, but well worth the solid tasting food and wonderful service."
189,"I've come here several times and have had great experiences each time. Be it afternoon, evening, or night, this place has fantastic service and wonderful food.Tonight hubs and I had a beer each while waiting for our order (Santa Fe salad and chile rellenos). The total came to $36 and I tipped up to $42. Seating inside is 8 small-ish tables that seat 2/3 each (booth on the back). There is more seating outside.Even when lines get long, the food comes out fast and hot. The staff are extremely friendly. There's Tapatio and tobasco and other bottles hot sauces available if you dine in."
190,Came here after a wedding and the guys that work here followed us out to our car and took pictures of our license plate as we were trying to leave. They were accusing us of knowing somebody else who they thought hit their truck. Not only will we not be back but we will be following up with this issue as this was completely uncalled for. One of the workers wanted to fight us. That's not how you run a business.
191,"This place has great food. The menu is huge, and reasonably priced. Their breakfast burritos are on point! The food is mixed traditional, authentic Mexican food as well as MexicanAmerican food (burritos, nachos).Everybody here is pretty friendly,  and I think just about everything they make is made from scratch. While you can get your food to go, this is not a ""fast-food"" restaurant, really. It could be fun to sit down there also, there's lots of tables inside and outside. A majority of the food is fresh and made to order and comes out piping-hot off the grill. Don't confuse this with some local Berkeley Taco Bell. Mission is legit, awesome, awesome food."
192,"Hands down the best Mexican food in Berkeley. The mole poblano burrito, either with chicken or carnitas is excellent, and the platanos and beans are awesome. But let me reiterate- do not miss out on the amazing mole here!!!Casual atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating, in a quiet area of Berkeley far from the university. Food is delivered to your table quickly, service is nothing outstanding, but good enough.Food is priced well for how much food you get- I paid a bit over $10 for a burrito that's probably going to keep me full for two days lolol"
193,"We had a good experience at La Mission this afternoon. We ordered tacos de papa, cocktail, and tacos de Barbacoa. Tacos were delicious, cocktail filling, lots of shrimp. Juice and sangria were so so. But overall good experience. Fresh breeze, out door  seating and friendly staff!"
194,"Super awesome taqueria right on the main drag of university avenue.They have their own small parking lot behind the building accessible via chestnut st. in addition to the usual street parking. Usually there's a spot or two available at any given time, although the super popular lunch rush can be very busy.There is pleasing inside and outside seating. The outside seating is larger then most places of this type, and is particularly nice on a sunny day, what with the natural shade provided by several friendly trees. Inside seating is the usual booth/chair combos al fast food restaurant style.  the look of the place scream re-purposed fast food chain to me, but the owners have made it all their own local styling, even if the inside is dominated by the order counter.Service  is of the order and pick up when called model. The menu consists of the usual taqueria suspects-burrito, taco, combo platters with slightly more variety. They offer the full range of meats including barbacoa, lengua, camarón (shrimp) and several different varieties of fish. There are also three different stylings of veg burrito/tacos including vegan and grilled veg options, which is nice to see. The breakfast menu is especially strong, and they have an awesome salsa/condiment bar.  Pricing for these items is fairly standard for the area about three bucks a taco and everything else pretty much starts at 7 bucks. Typically a meal will run about ten dollars with a drink and add ons, but it's possible to go the bare bones bargain route for slightly less. It's the flavor, convenience, and quality of the food that really shines here.One of the better lunch/breakfast options for the area for sure."
195,"Solid, good, authentic mexican food.   Whether you want tacos, enchiladas, tortas, burritos, pozole, etc., this place does not disappoint.Highly recommend for the price and the service.  There is also a parking lot and great outdoor seating."
196,I have frequently passed by this place but never gave it any thought to stop by but with the recommendation we decided to stop in for lunch I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and good this place actually was Food: grilled chicken tacos & steak (good) blk beans & rice everything was fresh the food was heavy which I liked and I like the way the meat  was cut into small pieces because I definitely dislike big chunks of meat with a lot of fat Service: fastAmbience: gives u a little feel of a little taqueria in Mexico Conclusion: better than I thought I will definitely return I love their chicken tacos and their rice and beans everything was fresh very tasty very good light and healthy I would say give this place a try

218,"I understand from friends that the meat options are tasty, but the veggie and fish burritos and tacos I've had here were poor.The staff are always friendly, and you get nice thick chips, but nothing else has been good the three times I've visited."
219,I am no Mexican food expert but I thought their burrito was solid. I had a plain old vegetarian burrito without any extras like sour cream or guacamole and I also didn't get cheese. They give you a choice of black beans or refried. I super love their salsa offerings. The tomatillo salsa and the other one (I can't remember which) are both delicious and I totally drowned every bite of my burrito with both.The burrito itself was huge but was the perfect thing after I was famished from climbing. Definitely better than Monte Cristo up the street!
220,"TL;DR 5/5 carnitas tacosCame here during dinner time, line was not too bad. I ordered 3 tacos, carnitas, carne asada, and another something taco. The sauce, cilantro, onion, everything was the perfect taste and ratio. My favorite was the carnitas, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. They have a wide variety of items on their menu, and I will definitely be back to try the rest!This is my friend's top taco place in Berkeley, and I would also put this at the top of my list.La Mission is accessible via AC Transit 51B or car (small parking lot in the back)."
221,How come my simple to-go order can't be prepared correctly? Is asking for pico de gallo too complicated? I'm tired of getting home to find out that my food was made incorrectly. I try to keep any additions simple. I think I forgot why I like La Mission. I'm finished hoping you'll get my order right.
222,"we got off our night shift and went here for breakfast. There was no wait time at all, the restaurant just opened for the day. we were first customers. restaurant was very clean. There was a breakfast menu and we could order from full menu. we also ordered pitcher of sangria - which was  great.4 star for food. felt like food was cooked quick, slightly undercooked. 5 star for service. Will def stop by here for more food"
223,"I so wanted breakfast, My meeting ran late so I had to settle for the tacos. The grilled fish taco was good. The Tacos al pastor were ok. Not great although not bad. Tortillas are small although they make up for the amount of meat they put on. Salsa did not have much flavor. The staff was friendly and I will be back for the breakfast."
224,"Best spot in Berkeley for Mexican food.  My favorite is the baja fish taco, $5.50.  I thought it was expensive for one taco but it is huge!  They give a generous serving of fish, crema, cabbage, and tomatoes.  I love the breading of the fish, giving a nice crispy texture with moist fish inside, and the crema makes for a great flavor combo.  Delish!The horchata is really sweet, but becomes perfect when the ice melts.  This place has got friendly staff, a great vibe, is clean, has outside garden seating, and also boasts a parking lot in the back to top it off (no Berkeley street parking necessary)."
225,"Service was efficient and friendly, but La Mission's chicken dishes leave everything to be desired. If you eat pork, they have your back (the pozole for example), but the chicken is literally tiny dry cubes of meat with no flavor. I spent 17$ and change on two street tacos a small salad and one beer. Seemed outrageously high relative to the quality and amount of food. Maybe the other tacos are just so much more delicious? If I were them I would pull all the cubed chicken off the menu. The green salad was good, though sparse. I liked that it had pepitas, cabbage shreds and a vinaigrette dressing. Not sure I would come back just for that though with so many other amazing Mexican places around the area. Sad because I really wanted to love this place!"
226,"This is by far my favorite taco place in the bay area!The grand tacos here has 2 shells (1 soft 1 hard) and has more fillings than normal tacos. I normally go for the beef and the fish taco while my husband will have these 2 and a pork one as well. The fish is always crispy outside and tender inside, with a light dressing to compliment the flavor. The beef taco doesn't skim on the beef quantity like a lot other places. We also like the nachos here. In fact it is the favorite dish for my mother who comes from China. The service is slightly slow here but that's because they make everything fresh. It's a wait I'm willing to have for good quality food。"
227,Best Mexican food in Berkeley. Really really fresh meats and diverse vegetarian choices. Excellent moles and savory menudo. Perfect snacking for a summer afternoon.
228,"Mission Accomplished. Decent Mexican food found in Berkeley!Food: Have your pick from tacos to burritos, soups, entree plates, aguas frescas and even some fresh desserts if you're sweet tooth kicks in. I went with a simple and classic cheesy quesadilla, but added prawns to fancy it up a bit. Oozing with cheesy, grilled to near perfection and boasting with fresh flavors of chopped prawns; it was truly delicious. My friend ordered the Al Pastor Burrito which was packed with some of the best marinated and juicy chunks of meat we've ever had, he ordered it with everything, both of us were surprised the burrito didn't fall apart upon first bite. It was the perfect blend of fresh and savory ingredients all enclosed in a grilled and slightly charred flour tortilla. The salsa was the only issue as it wasn't nearly as spicy nor fresh as I hoped for. Chips are not free, that was a bummer as well. Other than that, the food was solid.Price: A bit steeper than your average casual Mexican eatery, but worth the price. Ambiance: Cozy and small interior, very tight and minimal seating, but they do have a huge outdoor patio equipped with tons of natural shading from the big trees. Parking lot is behind the building.Service: The young man that took our order greeted us with a genuine smile and was very patient. Same story with the young man that brought us our food.Overall: I was getting a bit tired of driving to Oakland for Mexican food, so I'm glad I finally found fresh and decent tasting Mexican food in Berkeley. Prices are a bit steeper than I'd like, but well worth the solid tasting food and wonderful service."
229,"I've come here several times and have had great experiences each time. Be it afternoon, evening, or night, this place has fantastic service and wonderful food.Tonight hubs and I had a beer each while waiting for our order (Santa Fe salad and chile rellenos). The total came to $36 and I tipped up to $42. Seating inside is 8 small-ish tables that seat 2/3 each (booth on the back). There is more seating outside.Even when lines get long, the food comes out fast and hot. The staff are extremely friendly. There's Tapatio and tobasco and other bottles hot sauces available if you dine in."
230,Came here after a wedding and the guys that work here followed us out to our car and took pictures of our license plate as we were trying to leave. They were accusing us of knowing somebody else who they thought hit their truck. Not only will we not be back but we will be following up with this issue as this was completely uncalled for. One of the workers wanted to fight us. That's not how you run a business.
231,"This place has great food. The menu is huge, and reasonably priced. Their breakfast burritos are on point! The food is mixed traditional, authentic Mexican food as well as MexicanAmerican food (burritos, nachos).Everybody here is pretty friendly,  and I think just about everything they make is made from scratch. While you can get your food to go, this is not a ""fast-food"" restaurant, really. It could be fun to sit down there also, there's lots of tables inside and outside. A majority of the food is fresh and made to order and comes out piping-hot off the grill. Don't confuse this with some local Berkeley Taco Bell. Mission is legit, awesome, awesome food."
232,"Hands down the best Mexican food in Berkeley. The mole poblano burrito, either with chicken or carnitas is excellent, and the platanos and beans are awesome. But let me reiterate- do not miss out on the amazing mole here!!!Casual atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating, in a quiet area of Berkeley far from the university. Food is delivered to your table quickly, service is nothing outstanding, but good enough.Food is priced well for how much food you get- I paid a bit over $10 for a burrito that's probably going to keep me full for two days lolol"
233,"We had a good experience at La Mission this afternoon. We ordered tacos de papa, cocktail, and tacos de Barbacoa. Tacos were delicious, cocktail filling, lots of shrimp. Juice and sangria were so so. But overall good experience. Fresh breeze, out door  seating and friendly staff!"
234,"Super awesome taqueria right on the main drag of university avenue.They have their own small parking lot behind the building accessible via chestnut st. in addition to the usual street parking. Usually there's a spot or two available at any given time, although the super popular lunch rush can be very busy.There is pleasing inside and outside seating. The outside seating is larger then most places of this type, and is particularly nice on a sunny day, what with the natural shade provided by several friendly trees. Inside seating is the usual booth/chair combos al fast food restaurant style.  the look of the place scream re-purposed fast food chain to me, but the owners have made it all their own local styling, even if the inside is dominated by the order counter.Service  is of the order and pick up when called model. The menu consists of the usual taqueria suspects-burrito, taco, combo platters with slightly more variety. They offer the full range of meats including barbacoa, lengua, camarón (shrimp) and several different varieties of fish. There are also three different stylings of veg burrito/tacos including vegan and grilled veg options, which is nice to see. The breakfast menu is especially strong, and they have an awesome salsa/condiment bar.  Pricing for these items is fairly standard for the area about three bucks a taco and everything else pretty much starts at 7 bucks. Typically a meal will run about ten dollars with a drink and add ons, but it's possible to go the bare bones bargain route for slightly less. It's the flavor, convenience, and quality of the food that really shines here.One of the better lunch/breakfast options for the area for sure."
235,"Solid, good, authentic mexican food.   Whether you want tacos, enchiladas, tortas, burritos, pozole, etc., this place does not disappoint.Highly recommend for the price and the service.  There is also a parking lot and great outdoor seating."
236,I have frequently passed by this place but never gave it any thought to stop by but with the recommendation we decided to stop in for lunch I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and good this place actually was Food: grilled chicken tacos & steak (good) blk beans & rice everything was fresh the food was heavy which I liked and I like the way the meat  was cut into small pieces because I definitely dislike big chunks of meat with a lot of fat Service: fastAmbience: gives u a little feel of a little taqueria in Mexico Conclusion: better than I thought I will definitely return I love their chicken tacos and their rice and beans everything was fresh very tasty very good light and healthy I would say give this place a try

264,"Best spot in Berkeley for Mexican food.  My favorite is the baja fish taco, $5.50.  I thought it was expensive for one taco but it is huge!  They give a generous serving of fish, crema, cabbage, and tomatoes.  I love the breading of the fish, giving a nice crispy texture with moist fish inside, and the crema makes for a great flavor combo.  Delish!The horchata is really sweet, but becomes perfect when the ice melts.  This place has got friendly staff, a great vibe, is clean, has outside garden seating, and also boasts a parking lot in the back to top it off (no Berkeley street parking necessary)."
265,"Service was efficient and friendly, but La Mission's chicken dishes leave everything to be desired. If you eat pork, they have your back (the pozole for example), but the chicken is literally tiny dry cubes of meat with no flavor. I spent 17$ and change on two street tacos a small salad and one beer. Seemed outrageously high relative to the quality and amount of food. Maybe the other tacos are just so much more delicious? If I were them I would pull all the cubed chicken off the menu. The green salad was good, though sparse. I liked that it had pepitas, cabbage shreds and a vinaigrette dressing. Not sure I would come back just for that though with so many other amazing Mexican places around the area. Sad because I really wanted to love this place!"
266,"This is by far my favorite taco place in the bay area!The grand tacos here has 2 shells (1 soft 1 hard) and has more fillings than normal tacos. I normally go for the beef and the fish taco while my husband will have these 2 and a pork one as well. The fish is always crispy outside and tender inside, with a light dressing to compliment the flavor. The beef taco doesn't skim on the beef quantity like a lot other places. We also like the nachos here. In fact it is the favorite dish for my mother who comes from China. The service is slightly slow here but that's because they make everything fresh. It's a wait I'm willing to have for good quality food。"
267,Best Mexican food in Berkeley. Really really fresh meats and diverse vegetarian choices. Excellent moles and savory menudo. Perfect snacking for a summer afternoon.
268,"Mission Accomplished. Decent Mexican food found in Berkeley!Food: Have your pick from tacos to burritos, soups, entree plates, aguas frescas and even some fresh desserts if you're sweet tooth kicks in. I went with a simple and classic cheesy quesadilla, but added prawns to fancy it up a bit. Oozing with cheesy, grilled to near perfection and boasting with fresh flavors of chopped prawns; it was truly delicious. My friend ordered the Al Pastor Burrito which was packed with some of the best marinated and juicy chunks of meat we've ever had, he ordered it with everything, both of us were surprised the burrito didn't fall apart upon first bite. It was the perfect blend of fresh and savory ingredients all enclosed in a grilled and slightly charred flour tortilla. The salsa was the only issue as it wasn't nearly as spicy nor fresh as I hoped for. Chips are not free, that was a bummer as well. Other than that, the food was solid.Price: A bit steeper than your average casual Mexican eatery, but worth the price. Ambiance: Cozy and small interior, very tight and minimal seating, but they do have a huge outdoor patio equipped with tons of natural shading from the big trees. Parking lot is behind the building.Service: The young man that took our order greeted us with a genuine smile and was very patient. Same story with the young man that brought us our food.Overall: I was getting a bit tired of driving to Oakland for Mexican food, so I'm glad I finally found fresh and decent tasting Mexican food in Berkeley. Prices are a bit steeper than I'd like, but well worth the solid tasting food and wonderful service."
269,"I've come here several times and have had great experiences each time. Be it afternoon, evening, or night, this place has fantastic service and wonderful food.Tonight hubs and I had a beer each while waiting for our order (Santa Fe salad and chile rellenos). The total came to $36 and I tipped up to $42. Seating inside is 8 small-ish tables that seat 2/3 each (booth on the back). There is more seating outside.Even when lines get long, the food comes out fast and hot. The staff are extremely friendly. There's Tapatio and tobasco and other bottles hot sauces available if you dine in."
270,Came here after a wedding and the guys that work here followed us out to our car and took pictures of our license plate as we were trying to leave. They were accusing us of knowing somebody else who they thought hit their truck. Not only will we not be back but we will be following up with this issue as this was completely uncalled for. One of the workers wanted to fight us. That's not how you run a business.
271,"This place has great food. The menu is huge, and reasonably priced. Their breakfast burritos are on point! The food is mixed traditional, authentic Mexican food as well as MexicanAmerican food (burritos, nachos).Everybody here is pretty friendly,  and I think just about everything they make is made from scratch. While you can get your food to go, this is not a ""fast-food"" restaurant, really. It could be fun to sit down there also, there's lots of tables inside and outside. A majority of the food is fresh and made to order and comes out piping-hot off the grill. Don't confuse this with some local Berkeley Taco Bell. Mission is legit, awesome, awesome food."
272,"Hands down the best Mexican food in Berkeley. The mole poblano burrito, either with chicken or carnitas is excellent, and the platanos and beans are awesome. But let me reiterate- do not miss out on the amazing mole here!!!Casual atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating, in a quiet area of Berkeley far from the university. Food is delivered to your table quickly, service is nothing outstanding, but good enough.Food is priced well for how much food you get- I paid a bit over $10 for a burrito that's probably going to keep me full for two days lolol"
273,"We had a good experience at La Mission this afternoon. We ordered tacos de papa, cocktail, and tacos de Barbacoa. Tacos were delicious, cocktail filling, lots of shrimp. Juice and sangria were so so. But overall good experience. Fresh breeze, out door  seating and friendly staff!"
274,"Super awesome taqueria right on the main drag of university avenue.They have their own small parking lot behind the building accessible via chestnut st. in addition to the usual street parking. Usually there's a spot or two available at any given time, although the super popular lunch rush can be very busy.There is pleasing inside and outside seating. The outside seating is larger then most places of this type, and is particularly nice on a sunny day, what with the natural shade provided by several friendly trees. Inside seating is the usual booth/chair combos al fast food restaurant style.  the look of the place scream re-purposed fast food chain to me, but the owners have made it all their own local styling, even if the inside is dominated by the order counter.Service  is of the order and pick up when called model. The menu consists of the usual taqueria suspects-burrito, taco, combo platters with slightly more variety. They offer the full range of meats including barbacoa, lengua, camarón (shrimp) and several different varieties of fish. There are also three different stylings of veg burrito/tacos including vegan and grilled veg options, which is nice to see. The breakfast menu is especially strong, and they have an awesome salsa/condiment bar.  Pricing for these items is fairly standard for the area about three bucks a taco and everything else pretty much starts at 7 bucks. Typically a meal will run about ten dollars with a drink and add ons, but it's possible to go the bare bones bargain route for slightly less. It's the flavor, convenience, and quality of the food that really shines here.One of the better lunch/breakfast options for the area for sure."
275,"Solid, good, authentic mexican food.   Whether you want tacos, enchiladas, tortas, burritos, pozole, etc., this place does not disappoint.Highly recommend for the price and the service.  There is also a parking lot and great outdoor seating."
276,I have frequently passed by this place but never gave it any thought to stop by but with the recommendation we decided to stop in for lunch I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and good this place actually was Food: grilled chicken tacos & steak (good) blk beans & rice everything was fresh the food was heavy which I liked and I like the way the meat  was cut into small pieces because I definitely dislike big chunks of meat with a lot of fat Service: fastAmbience: gives u a little feel of a little taqueria in Mexico Conclusion: better than I thought I will definitely return I love their chicken tacos and their rice and beans everything was fresh very tasty very good light and healthy I would say give this place a try
277,"Taco Trek Lesson 3, THE TORTILLA. The CORN tortilla is the double-layered  backbone of the taco experience, setting the tone for moisture and texture throughout the bite. The flavor of the corn is the floor upon which the flavors of the meat, fat, and toppings dance the Salsa! When talk-talking tacos, there are two types of corn tortillas to consider: fresh-made and factory-made.* Fresh tortillas are rare. If you're lucky enough to find tortillas rolled out ON-THE-SPOT from a press, quality is a WRAP! Fresh corn tortillas are always perfectly moist and tender, and need minimal added fat. The experience is like eating supple wontons or dumplings; the fresh tortilla is as pliable as soft cloth, and the corn never wads up into dry unpleasantness in the back of your mouth. Fresh tortillas, however, have zero shelf-life, and thus we get to...* Factory tortillas, which are common. Tortillas made in a factory have added preservatives and binding agents that make them dense, dry, and disgusting -- but they can be made awesome again through the absorption of enough fat on a hot griddle! Simply steaming factory tortillas is UNACCEPTABLE to a tacossieur like me, because they get doughy and taste acidic. Automatic Taco Fail!* Pro-tip: You can tell the QUALITY of a corn tortilla just from a TACO PHOTO. :::: Positively Awesome: 1) Round corners at the folds, 2) Oil-stained, deep color, 3) some shine on the surface -- tender and moist, let's rejoice! 4) Greased spots of golden-brown -- crisped on the griddle to be chewy in the middle!:::: God-Awful: 1) Sharp corners at the folded edges -- MEH, mostly dry. 2) Light-colored, dry-looking surface -- cotton-mouth! Keep away! 3) Wet, doughy-looking surface (sure sign of gringo tacos) -- acidic YUCKTOWN._______ Strictly a review of La Mission's TACOS _______Tacos were sadly MEH-diocre. I suspect the overall 4-star review was was given by burrito-eaters that are HIGHLY FORGIVING of crappy meats. Time to take a BART ride to the Fruitvale for some real-deal taco trucks, my Gringos. Check out my TACO TREK LIST to get you started.3   M I N U S E S- FAILS de CARNESRemember, tacos are all about delivering delicious MEAT-DECADENCE into your mouth. No hiding the flavor of the meat with cheese, lettuce, beans, rice, guac, cream, etc. Pureza means PURITY!:::: Borrego -- MEH-EH-EH-EH. Lamb Barbacoa was gamy and dry. The marinade was decent, but not enough to rescue the meat. I had one bite of LAMB FAT that was great, though.:::: Al Pastor -- MEH'VERAGE. All around dry, barely tasted any pork fat. The shallow marinade tasted like mild Tapatio.:::: Carnitas -- GAR'MEHGE. Chipotle-vels of CarMEHtas failure. Didn't even taste like pork. More of a dry, cotton-mouthed protein filler. Awful.- BORED-TILLAS:::: Tortillas -- NEED LOTION. Dry, and in need of moisturizing from some oil. After 4 minutes, these unlotioned tortillas absorbed too much moisture, thus becoming doughy in places, and pretty gross. Folks who prefer flour tortillas to corn tortillas do so because of tortillas LIKE THESE.- GRINGOFIED MENUMeat quality is automatically suspect if certain authentic and standard carnes aren't on the menu: no cabeza, no lengua, no tripe... This probably means that the clientele is inexperienced, and thus these delicacies will go unordered. This probably also means that the meats that are on the menu aren't going to be that awesome because the aforementioned inexperienced clientele will not demand quality.2   S T A R S* STEAK'ED THEIR CLAIM:::: Carne Asada Taco -- PURDY GOOD.

278,"I understand from friends that the meat options are tasty, but the veggie and fish burritos and tacos I've had here were poor.The staff are always friendly, and you get nice thick chips, but nothing else has been good the three times I've visited."
279,I am no Mexican food expert but I thought their burrito was solid. I had a plain old vegetarian burrito without any extras like sour cream or guacamole and I also didn't get cheese. They give you a choice of black beans or refried. I super love their salsa offerings. The tomatillo salsa and the other one (I can't remember which) are both delicious and I totally drowned every bite of my burrito with both.The burrito itself was huge but was the perfect thing after I was famished from climbing. Definitely better than Monte Cristo up the street!
280,"TL;DR 5/5 carnitas tacosCame here during dinner time, line was not too bad. I ordered 3 tacos, carnitas, carne asada, and another something taco. The sauce, cilantro, onion, everything was the perfect taste and ratio. My favorite was the carnitas, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside.

281,How come my simple to-go order can't be prepared correctly? Is asking for pico de gallo too complicated? I'm tired of getting home to find out that my food was made incorrectly.

It was the perfect blend of fresh and savory ingredients all enclosed in a grilled and slightly charred flour tortilla. The salsa was the only issue as it wasn't nearly as spicy nor fresh as I hoped for. Chips are not free, that was a bummer as well. Other than that, the food was solid.Price: A bit steeper than your average casual Mexican eatery, but worth the price. Ambiance: Cozy and small interior, very tight and minimal seating, but they do have a huge outdoor patio equipped with tons of natural shading from the big trees. Parking lot is behind the building.Service: The young man that took our order greeted us with a genuine smile and was very patient. Same story with the young man that brought us our food.Overall: I was getting a bit tired of driving to Oakland for Mexican food, so I'm glad I finally found fresh and decent tasting Mexican food in Berkeley. Prices are a bit steeper than I'd like, but well worth the solid tasting food and wonderful service."
309,"I've come here several times and have had great experiences each time. Be it afternoon, evening, or night, this place has fantastic service and wonderful food.Tonight hubs and I had a beer each while waiting for our order (Santa Fe salad and chile rellenos). The total came to $36 and I tipped up to $42. Seating inside is 8 small-ish tables that seat 2/3 each (booth on the back). There is more seating outside.Even when lines get long, the food comes out fast and hot. The staff are extremely friendly. There's Tapatio and tobasco and other bottles hot sauces available if you dine in."
310,Came here after a wedding and the guys that work here followed us out to our car and took pictures of our license plate as we were trying to leave. They were accusing us of knowing somebody else who they thought hit their truck. Not only will we not be back but we will be following up with this issue as this was completely uncalled for. One of the workers wanted to fight us. That's not how you run a business.
311,"This place has great food. The menu is huge, and reasonably priced. Their breakfast burritos are on point! The food is mixed traditional, authentic Mexican food as well as MexicanAmerican food (burritos, nachos).Everybody here is pretty friendly,  and I think just about everything they make is made from scratch. While you can get your food to go, this is not a ""fast-food"" restaurant, really. It could be fun to sit down there also, there's lots of tables inside and outside. A majority of the food is fresh and made to order and comes out piping-hot off the grill. Don't confuse this with some local Berkeley Taco Bell. Mission is legit, awesome, awesome food."
312,"Hands down the best Mexican food in Berkeley. The mole poblano burrito, either with chicken or carnitas is excellent, and the platanos and beans are awesome. But let me reiterate- do not miss out on the amazing mole here!!!Casual atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating, in a quiet area of Berkeley far from the university. Food is delivered to your table quickly, service is nothing outstanding, but good enough.Food is priced well for how much food you get- I paid a bit over $10 for a burrito that's probably going to keep me full for two days lolol"
313,"We had a good experience at La Mission this afternoon. We ordered tacos de papa, cocktail, and tacos de Barbacoa. Tacos were delicious, cocktail filling, lots of shrimp. Juice and sangria were so so. But overall good experience. Fresh breeze, out door  seating and friendly staff!"
314,"Super awesome taqueria right on the main drag of university avenue.They have their own small parking lot behind the building accessible via chestnut st. in addition to the usual street parking. Usually there's a spot or two available at any given time, although the super popular lunch rush can be very busy.There is pleasing inside and outside seating. The outside seating is larger then most places of this type, and is particularly nice on a sunny day, what with the natural shade provided by several friendly trees. Inside seating is the usual booth/chair combos al fast food restaurant style.  the look of the place scream re-purposed fast food chain to me, but the owners have made it all their own local styling, even if the inside is dominated by the order counter.Service  is of the order and pick up when called model. The menu consists of the usual taqueria suspects-burrito, taco, combo platters with slightly more variety. They offer the full range of meats including barbacoa, lengua, camarón (shrimp) and several different varieties of fish. There are also three different stylings of veg burrito/tacos including vegan and grilled veg options, which is nice to see. The breakfast menu is especially strong, and they have an awesome salsa/condiment bar.  Pricing for these items is fairly standard for the area about three bucks a taco and everything else pretty much starts at 7 bucks. Typically a meal will run about ten dollars with a drink and add ons, but it's possible to go the bare bones bargain route for slightly less. It's the flavor, convenience, and quality of the food that really shines here.One of the better lunch/breakfast options for the area for sure."
315,"Solid, good, authentic mexican food.   Whether you want tacos, enchiladas, tortas, burritos, pozole, etc., this place does not disappoint.Highly recommend for the price and the service.  There is also a parking lot and great outdoor seating."
316,I have frequently passed by this place but never gave it any thought to stop by but with the recommendation we decided to stop in for lunch I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and good this place actually was Food: grilled chicken tacos & steak (good) blk beans & rice everything was fresh the food was heavy which I liked and I like the way the meat  was cut into small pieces because I definitely dislike big chunks of meat with a lot of fat Service: fastAmbience: gives u a little feel of a little taqueria in Mexico Conclusion: better than I thought I will definitely return I love their chicken tacos and their rice and beans everything was fresh very tasty very good light and healthy I would say give this place a try
317,"Taco Trek Lesson 3, THE TORTILLA. The CORN tortilla is the double-layered  backbone of the taco experience, setting the tone for moisture and texture throughout the bite. The flavor of the corn is the floor upon which the flavors of the meat, fat, and toppings dance the Salsa! When talk-talking tacos, there are two types of corn tortillas to consider: fresh-made and factory-made.* Fresh tortillas are rare. If you're lucky enough to find tortillas rolled out ON-THE-SPOT from a press, quality is a WRAP! Fresh corn tortillas are always perfectly moist and tender, and need minimal added fat. The experience is like eating supple wontons or dumplings; the fresh tortilla is as pliable as soft cloth, and the corn never wads up into dry unpleasantness in the back of your mouth. Fresh tortillas, however, have zero shelf-life, and thus we get to...* Factory tortillas, which are common. Tortillas made in a factory have added preservatives and binding agents that make them dense, dry, and disgusting -- but they can be made awesome again through the absorption of enough fat on a hot griddle! Simply steaming factory tortillas is UNACCEPTABLE to a tacossieur like me, because they get doughy and taste acidic. Automatic Taco Fail!* Pro-tip: You can tell the QUALITY of a corn tortilla just from a TACO PHOTO. :::: Positively Awesome: 1) Round corners at the folds, 2) Oil-stained, deep color, 3) some shine on the surface -- tender and moist, let's rejoice! 4) Greased spots of golden-brown -- crisped on the griddle to be chewy in the middle!:::: God-Awful: 1) Sharp corners at the folded edges -- MEH, mostly dry. 2) Light-colored, dry-looking surface -- cotton-mouth! Keep away! 3) Wet, doughy-looking surface (sure sign of gringo tacos) -- acidic YUCKTOWN._______ Strictly a review of La Mission's TACOS _______Tacos were sadly MEH-diocre. I suspect the overall 4-star review was was given by burrito-eaters that are HIGHLY FORGIVING of crappy meats. Time to take a BART ride to the Fruitvale for some real-deal taco trucks, my Gringos. Check out my TACO TREK LIST to get you started.3   M I N U S E S- FAILS de CARNESRemember, tacos are all about delivering delicious MEAT-DECADENCE into your mouth. No hiding the flavor of the meat with cheese, lettuce, beans, rice, guac, cream, etc. Pureza means PURITY!:::: Borrego -- MEH-EH-EH-EH. Lamb Barbacoa was gamy and dry. The marinade was decent, but not enough to rescue the meat. I had one bite of LAMB FAT that was great, though.:::: Al Pastor -- MEH'VERAGE. All around dry, barely tasted any pork fat. The shallow marinade tasted like mild Tapatio.:::: Carnitas -- GAR'MEHGE. Chipotle-vels of CarMEHtas failure. Didn't even taste like pork. More of a dry, cotton-mouthed protein filler. Awful.- BORED-TILLAS:::: Tortillas -- NEED LOTION. Dry, and in need of moisturizing from some oil. After 4 minutes, these unlotioned tortillas absorbed too much moisture, thus becoming doughy in places, and pretty gross. Folks who prefer flour tortillas to corn tortillas do so because of tortillas LIKE THESE.- GRINGOFIED MENUMeat quality is automatically suspect if certain authentic and standard carnes aren't on the menu: no cabeza, no lengua, no tripe... This probably means that the clientele is inexperienced, and thus these delicacies will go unordered. This probably also means that the meats that are on the menu aren't going to be that awesome because the aforementioned inexperienced clientele will not demand quality.2   S T A R S* STEAK'ED THEIR CLAIM:::: Carne Asada Taco -- PURDY GOOD. Although the morsels alone seemed dry, biting into a mouthful of steak produced lovely moisture, and smoky flavor.*(1/2) BRIGHT-EYED SERVICEWelcoming, attentive, and bright-eyed friendliness from everyone I interacted with. Thank you so much guys!*(1/2) LOVELY OUTDOOR SPACEBring your beer to the pretty lil outdoor space with a trellis for shade, and enough tables to seat about 20."
318,"I understand from friends that the meat options are tasty, but the veggie and fish burritos and tacos I've had here were poor.The staff are always friendly, and you get nice thick chips, but nothing else has been good the three times I've visited."
319,I am no Mexican food expert but I thought their burrito was solid. I had a plain old vegetarian burrito without any extras like sour cream or guacamole and I also didn't get cheese. They give you a choice of black beans or refried. I super love their salsa offerings. The tomatillo salsa and the other one (I can't remember which) are both delicious and I totally drowned every bite of my burrito with both.The burrito itself was huge but was the perfect thing after I was famished from climbing. Definitely better than Monte Cristo up the street!
320,"TL;DR 5/5 carnitas tacosCame here during dinner time, line was not too bad. I ordered 3 tacos, carnitas, carne asada, and another something taco. The sauce, cilantro, onion, everything was the perfect taste and ratio. My favorite was the carnitas, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. They have a wide variety of items on their menu, and I will definitely be back to try the rest!This is my friend's top taco place in Berkeley, and I would also put this at the top of my list.La Mission is accessible via AC Transit 51B or car (small parking lot in the back)."
321,How come my simple to-go order can't be prepared correctly? Is asking for pico de gallo too complicated? I'm tired of getting home to find out that my food was made incorrectly. I try to keep any additions simple. I think I forgot why I like La Mission. I'm finished hoping you'll get my order right.
322,"we got off our night shift and went here for breakfast. There was no wait time at all, the restaurant just opened for the day. we were first customers. restaurant was very clean. There was a breakfast menu and we could order from full menu. we also ordered pitcher of sangria - which was  great.4 star for food. felt like food was cooked quick, slightly undercooked. 5 star for service. Will def stop by here for more food"
323,"I so wanted breakfast, My meeting ran late so I had to settle for the tacos. The grilled fish taco was good. The Tacos al pastor were ok. Not great although not bad. Tortillas are small although they make up for the amount of meat they put on. Salsa did not have much flavor. The staff was friendly and I will be back for the breakfast."
324,"Best spot in Berkeley for Mexican food.  My favorite is the baja fish taco, $5.50.  I thought it was expensive for one taco but it is huge!  They give a generous serving of fish, crema, cabbage, and tomatoes.  I love the breading of the fish, giving a nice crispy texture with moist fish inside, and the crema makes for a great flavor combo.  Delish!The horchata is really sweet, but becomes perfect when the ice melts.  This place has got friendly staff, a great vibe, is clean, has outside garden seating, and also boasts a parking lot in the back to top it off (no Berkeley street parking necessary)."
325,"Service was efficient and friendly, but La Mission's chicken dishes leave everything to be desired. If you eat pork, they have your back (the pozole for example), but the chicken is literally tiny dry cubes of meat with no flavor. I spent 17$ and change on two street tacos a small salad and one beer. Seemed outrageously high relative to the quality and amount of food. Maybe the other tacos are just so much more delicious? If I were them I would pull all the cubed chicken off the menu. The green salad was good, though sparse. I liked that it had pepitas, cabbage shreds and a vinaigrette dressing. Not sure I would come back just for that though with so many other amazing Mexican places around the area. Sad because I really wanted to love this place!"
326,"This is by far my favorite taco place in the bay area!The grand tacos here has 2 shells (1 soft 1 hard) and has more fillings than normal tacos. I normally go for the beef and the fish taco while my husband will have these 2 and a pork one as well. The fish is always crispy outside and tender inside, with a light dressing to compliment the flavor. The beef taco doesn't skim on the beef quantity like a lot other places. We also like the nachos here. In fact it is the favorite dish for my mother who comes from China. The service is slightly slow here but that's because they make everything fresh. It's a wait I'm willing to have for good quality food。"
327,Best Mexican food in Berkeley. Really really fresh meats and diverse vegetarian choices. Excellent moles and savory menudo. Perfect snacking for a summer afternoon.

But let me reiterate- do not miss out on the amazing mole here!!!Casual atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating, in a quiet area of Berkeley far from the university. Food is delivered to your table quickly, service is nothing outstanding, but good enough.Food is priced well for how much food you get- I paid a bit over $10 for a burrito that's probably going to keep me full for two days lolol"
353,"We had a good experience at La Mission this afternoon. We ordered tacos de papa, cocktail, and tacos de Barbacoa. Tacos were delicious, cocktail filling, lots of shrimp. Juice and sangria were so so. But overall good experience. Fresh breeze, out door  seating and friendly staff!"
354,"Super awesome taqueria right on the main drag of university avenue.They have their own small parking lot behind the building accessible via chestnut st. in addition to the usual street parking. Usually there's a spot or two available at any given time, although the super popular lunch rush can be very busy.There is pleasing inside and outside seating. The outside seating is larger then most places of this type, and is particularly nice on a sunny day, what with the natural shade provided by several friendly trees. Inside seating is the usual booth/chair combos al fast food restaurant style.  the look of the place scream re-purposed fast food chain to me, but the owners have made it all their own local styling, even if the inside is dominated by the order counter.Service  is of the order and pick up when called model. The menu consists of the usual taqueria suspects-burrito, taco, combo platters with slightly more variety. They offer the full range of meats including barbacoa, lengua, camarón (shrimp) and several different varieties of fish. There are also three different stylings of veg burrito/tacos including vegan and grilled veg options, which is nice to see. The breakfast menu is especially strong, and they have an awesome salsa/condiment bar.  Pricing for these items is fairly standard for the area about three bucks a taco and everything else pretty much starts at 7 bucks. Typically a meal will run about ten dollars with a drink and add ons, but it's possible to go the bare bones bargain route for slightly less. It's the flavor, convenience, and quality of the food that really shines here.One of the better lunch/breakfast options for the area for sure."
355,"Solid, good, authentic mexican food.   Whether you want tacos, enchiladas, tortas, burritos, pozole, etc., this place does not disappoint.Highly recommend for the price and the service.  There is also a parking lot and great outdoor seating."
356,I have frequently passed by this place but never gave it any thought to stop by but with the recommendation we decided to stop in for lunch I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and good this place actually was Food: grilled chicken tacos & steak (good) blk beans & rice everything was fresh the food was heavy which I liked and I like the way the meat  was cut into small pieces because I definitely dislike big chunks of meat with a lot of fat Service: fastAmbience: gives u a little feel of a little taqueria in Mexico Conclusion: better than I thought I will definitely return I love their chicken tacos and their rice and beans everything was fresh very tasty very good light and healthy I would say give this place a try
357,"Taco Trek Lesson 3, THE TORTILLA. The CORN tortilla is the double-layered  backbone of the taco experience, setting the tone for moisture and texture throughout the bite. The flavor of the corn is the floor upon which the flavors of the meat, fat, and toppings dance the Salsa! When talk-talking tacos, there are two types of corn tortillas to consider: fresh-made and factory-made.* Fresh tortillas are rare. If you're lucky enough to find tortillas rolled out ON-THE-SPOT from a press, quality is a WRAP! Fresh corn tortillas are always perfectly moist and tender, and need minimal added fat. The experience is like eating supple wontons or dumplings; the fresh tortilla is as pliable as soft cloth, and the corn never wads up into dry unpleasantness in the back of your mouth. Fresh tortillas, however, have zero shelf-life, and thus we get to...* Factory tortillas, which are common. Tortillas made in a factory have added preservatives and binding agents that make them dense, dry, and disgusting -- but they can be made awesome again through the absorption of enough fat on a hot griddle! Simply steaming factory tortillas is UNACCEPTABLE to a tacossieur like me, because they get doughy and taste acidic. Automatic Taco Fail!* Pro-tip: You can tell the QUALITY of a corn tortilla just from a TACO PHOTO. :::: Positively Awesome: 1) Round corners at the folds, 2) Oil-stained, deep color, 3) some shine on the surface -- tender and moist, let's rejoice! 4) Greased spots of golden-brown -- crisped on the griddle to be chewy in the middle!:::: God-Awful: 1) Sharp corners at the folded edges -- MEH, mostly dry. 2) Light-colored, dry-looking surface -- cotton-mouth! Keep away! 3) Wet, doughy-looking surface (sure sign of gringo tacos) -- acidic YUCKTOWN._______ Strictly a review of La Mission's TACOS _______Tacos were sadly MEH-diocre. I suspect the overall 4-star review was was given by burrito-eaters that are HIGHLY FORGIVING of crappy meats. Time to take a BART ride to the Fruitvale for some real-deal taco trucks, my Gringos. Check out my TACO TREK LIST to get you started.3   M I N U S E S- FAILS de CARNESRemember, tacos are all about delivering delicious MEAT-DECADENCE into your mouth. No hiding the flavor of the meat with cheese, lettuce, beans, rice, guac, cream, etc. Pureza means PURITY!:::: Borrego -- MEH-EH-EH-EH. Lamb Barbacoa was gamy and dry. The marinade was decent, but not enough to rescue the meat. I had one bite of LAMB FAT that was great, though.:::: Al Pastor -- MEH'VERAGE. All around dry, barely tasted any pork fat. The shallow marinade tasted like mild Tapatio.:::: Carnitas -- GAR'MEHGE. Chipotle-vels of CarMEHtas failure. Didn't even taste like pork. More of a dry, cotton-mouthed protein filler. Awful.- BORED-TILLAS:::: Tortillas -- NEED LOTION. Dry, and in need of moisturizing from some oil. After 4 minutes, these unlotioned tortillas absorbed too much moisture, thus becoming doughy in places, and pretty gross. Folks who prefer flour tortillas to corn tortillas do so because of tortillas LIKE THESE.- GRINGOFIED MENUMeat quality is automatically suspect if certain authentic and standard carnes aren't on the menu: no cabeza, no lengua, no tripe... This probably means that the clientele is inexperienced, and thus these delicacies will go unordered. This probably also means that the meats that are on the menu aren't going to be that awesome because the aforementioned inexperienced clientele will not demand quality.2   S T A R S* STEAK'ED THEIR CLAIM:::: Carne Asada Taco -- PURDY GOOD. Although the morsels alone seemed dry, biting into a mouthful of steak produced lovely moisture, and smoky flavor.*(1/2) BRIGHT-EYED SERVICEWelcoming, attentive, and bright-eyed friendliness from everyone I interacted with. Thank you so much guys!*(1/2) LOVELY OUTDOOR SPACEBring your beer to the pretty lil outdoor space with a trellis for shade, and enough tables to seat about 20."
358,"I understand from friends that the meat options are tasty, but the veggie and fish burritos and tacos I've had here were poor.The staff are always friendly, and you get nice thick chips, but nothing else has been good the three times I've visited."
359,I am no Mexican food expert but I thought their burrito was solid. I had a plain old vegetarian burrito without any extras like sour cream or guacamole and I also didn't get cheese. They give you a choice of black beans or refried. I super love their salsa offerings. The tomatillo salsa and the other one (I can't remember which) are both delicious and I totally drowned every bite of my burrito with both.The burrito itself was huge but was the perfect thing after I was famished from climbing. Definitely better than Monte Cristo up the street!
360,"TL;DR 5/5 carnitas tacosCame here during dinner time, line was not too bad. I ordered 3 tacos, carnitas, carne asada, and another something taco. The sauce, cilantro, onion, everything was the perfect taste and ratio. My favorite was the carnitas, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. They have a wide variety of items on their menu, and I will definitely be back to try the rest!This is my friend's top taco place in Berkeley, and I would also put this at the top of my list.La Mission is accessible via AC Transit 51B or car (small parking lot in the back)."
361,How come my simple to-go order can't be prepared correctly? Is asking for pico de gallo too complicated? I'm tired of getting home to find out that my food was made incorrectly. I try to keep any additions simple. I think I forgot why I like La Mission. I'm finished hoping you'll get my order right.
362,"we got off our night shift and went here for breakfast. There was no wait time at all, the restaurant just opened for the day. we were first customers. restaurant was very clean. There was a breakfast menu and we could order from full menu. we also ordered pitcher of sangria - which was  great.4 star for food. felt like food was cooked quick, slightly undercooked. 5 star for service. Will def stop by here for more food"
363,"I so wanted breakfast, My meeting ran late so I had to settle for the tacos. The grilled fish taco was good. The Tacos al pastor were ok. Not great although not bad. Tortillas are small although they make up for the amount of meat they put on. Salsa did not have much flavor. The staff was friendly and I will be back for the breakfast."
364,"Best spot in Berkeley for Mexican food.  My favorite is the baja fish taco, $5.50.  I thought it was expensive for one taco but it is huge!  They give a generous serving of fish, crema, cabbage, and tomatoes.  I love the breading of the fish, giving a nice crispy texture with moist fish inside, and the crema makes for a great flavor combo.  Delish!The horchata is really sweet, but becomes perfect when the ice melts.  This place has got friendly staff, a great vibe, is clean, has outside garden seating, and also boasts a parking lot in the back to top it off (no Berkeley street parking necessary)."
365,"Service was efficient and friendly, but La Mission's chicken dishes leave everything to be desired. If you eat pork, they have your back (the pozole for example), but the chicken is literally tiny dry cubes of meat with no flavor. I spent 17$ and change on two street tacos a small salad and one beer. Seemed outrageously high relative to the quality and amount of food. Maybe the other tacos are just so much more delicious? If I were them I would pull all the cubed chicken off the menu. The green salad was good, though sparse. I liked that it had pepitas, cabbage shreds and a vinaigrette dressing. Not sure I would come back just for that though with so many other amazing Mexican places around the area. Sad because I really wanted to love this place!"
366,"This is by far my favorite taco place in the bay area!The grand tacos here has 2 shells (1 soft 1 hard) and has more fillings than normal tacos. I normally go for the beef and the fish taco while my husband will have these 2 and a pork one as well. The fish is always crispy outside and tender inside, with a light dressing to compliment the flavor. The beef taco doesn't skim on the beef quantity like a lot other places. We also like the nachos here. In fact it is the favorite dish for my mother who comes from China. The service is slightly slow here but that's because they make everything fresh. It's a wait I'm willing to have for good quality food。"
367,Best Mexican food in Berkeley. Really really fresh meats and diverse vegetarian choices. Excellent moles and savory menudo. Perfect snacking for a summer afternoon.
368,"Mission Accomplished. Decent Mexican food found in Berkeley!Food: Have your pick from tacos to burritos, soups, entree plates, aguas frescas and even some fresh desserts if you're sweet tooth kicks in. I went with a simple and classic cheesy quesadilla, but added prawns to fancy it up a bit. Oozing with cheesy, grilled to near perfection and boasting with fresh flavors of chopped prawns; it was truly delicious. My friend ordered the Al Pastor Burrito which was packed with some of the best marinated and juicy chunks of meat we've ever had, he ordered it with everything, both of us were surprised the burrito didn't fall apart upon first bite. It was the perfect blend of fresh and savory ingredients all enclosed in a grilled and slightly charred flour tortilla. The salsa was the only issue as it wasn't nearly as spicy nor fresh as I hoped for. Chips are not free, that was a bummer as well. Other than that, the food was solid.Price: A bit steeper than your average casual Mexican eatery, but worth the price. Ambiance: Cozy and small interior, very tight and minimal seating, but they do have a huge outdoor patio equipped with tons of natural shading from the big trees. Parking lot is behind the building.Service: The young man that took our order greeted us with a genuine smile and was very patient. Same story with the young man that brought us our food.Overall: I was getting a bit tired of driving to Oakland for Mexican food, so I'm glad I finally found fresh and decent tasting Mexican food in Berkeley. Prices are a bit steeper than I'd like, but well worth the solid tasting food and wonderful service."
369,"I've come here several times and have had great experiences each time. Be it afternoon, evening, or night, this place has fantastic service and wonderful food.Tonight hubs and I had a beer each while waiting for our order (Santa Fe salad and chile rellenos). The total came to $36 and I tipped up to $42. Seating inside is 8 small-ish tables that seat 2/3 each (booth on the back). There is more seating outside.Even when lines get long, the food comes out fast and hot. The staff are extremely friendly. There's Tapatio and tobasco and other bottles hot sauces available if you dine in."
370,Came here after a wedding and the guys that work here followed us out to our car and took pictures of our license plate as we were trying to leave. They were accusing us of knowing somebody else who they thought hit their truck. Not only will we not be back but we will be following up with this issue as this was completely uncalled for. One of the workers wanted to fight us. That's not how you run a business.
371,"This place has great food. The menu is huge, and reasonably priced. Their breakfast burritos are on point! The food is mixed traditional, authentic Mexican food as well as MexicanAmerican food (burritos, nachos).Everybody here is pretty friendly,  and I think just about everything they make is made from scratch. While you can get your food to go, this is not a ""fast-food"" restaurant, really. It could be fun to sit down there also, there's lots of tables inside and outside.

The flavor of the corn is the floor upon which the flavors of the meat, fat, and toppings dance the Salsa! When talk-talking tacos, there are two types of corn tortillas to consider: fresh-made and factory-made.* Fresh tortillas are rare. If you're lucky enough to find tortillas rolled out ON-THE-SPOT from a press, quality is a WRAP! Fresh corn tortillas are always perfectly moist and tender, and need minimal added fat. The experience is like eating supple wontons or dumplings; the fresh tortilla is as pliable as soft cloth, and the corn never wads up into dry unpleasantness in the back of your mouth. Fresh tortillas, however, have zero shelf-life, and thus we get to...* Factory tortillas, which are common. Tortillas made in a factory have added preservatives and binding agents that make them dense, dry, and disgusting -- but they can be made awesome again through the absorption of enough fat on a hot griddle! Simply steaming factory tortillas is UNACCEPTABLE to a tacossieur like me, because they get doughy and taste acidic. Automatic Taco Fail!* Pro-tip: You can tell the QUALITY of a corn tortilla just from a TACO PHOTO. :::: Positively Awesome: 1) Round corners at the folds, 2) Oil-stained, deep color, 3) some shine on the surface -- tender and moist, let's rejoice! 4) Greased spots of golden-brown -- crisped on the griddle to be chewy in the middle!:::: God-Awful: 1) Sharp corners at the folded edges -- MEH, mostly dry. 2) Light-colored, dry-looking surface -- cotton-mouth!

Check out my TACO TREK LIST to get you started.3   M I N U S E S- FAILS de CARNESRemember, tacos are all about delivering delicious MEAT-DECADENCE into your mouth. No hiding the flavor of the meat with cheese, lettuce, beans, rice, guac, cream, etc. Pureza means PURITY!:::: Borrego -- MEH-EH-EH-EH. Lamb Barbacoa was gamy and dry. The marinade was decent, but not enough to rescue the meat. I had one bite of LAMB FAT that was great, though.:::: Al Pastor -- MEH'VERAGE. All around dry, barely tasted any pork fat. The shallow marinade tasted like mild Tapatio.:::: Carnitas -- GAR'MEHGE. Chipotle-vels of CarMEHtas failure. Didn't even taste like pork. More of a dry, cotton-mouthed protein filler. Awful.- BORED-TILLAS:::: Tortillas -- NEED LOTION. Dry, and in need of moisturizing from some oil. After 4 minutes, these unlotioned tortillas absorbed too much moisture, thus becoming doughy in places, and pretty gross.

398,"I understand from friends that the meat options are tasty, but the veggie and fish burritos and tacos I've had here were poor.The staff are always friendly, and you get nice thick chips, but nothing else has been good the three times I've visited."
399,I am no Mexican food expert but I thought their burrito was solid. I had a plain old vegetarian burrito without any extras like sour cream or guacamole and I also didn't get cheese. They give you a choice of black beans or refried. I super love their salsa offerings. The tomatillo salsa and the other one (I can't remember which) are both delicious and I totally drowned every bite of my burrito with both.The burrito itself was huge but was the perfect thing after I was famished from climbing. Definitely better than Monte Cristo up the street!
400,"TL;DR 5/5 carnitas tacosCame here during dinner time, line was not too bad. I ordered 3 tacos, carnitas, carne asada, and another something taco. The sauce, cilantro, onion, everything was the perfect taste and ratio. My favorite was the carnitas, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. They have a wide variety of items on their menu, and I will definitely be back to try the rest!This is my friend's top taco place in Berkeley, and I would also put this at the top of my list.La Mission is accessible via AC Transit 51B or car (small parking lot in the back)."
401,How come my simple to-go order can't be prepared correctly? Is asking for pico de gallo too complicated? I'm tired of getting home to find out that my food was made incorrectly. I try to keep any additions simple. I think I forgot why I like La Mission. I'm finished hoping you'll get my order right.
402,"we got off our night shift and went here for breakfast. There was no wait time at all, the restaurant just opened for the day. we were first customers. restaurant was very clean. There was a breakfast menu and we could order from full menu. we also ordered pitcher of sangria - which was  great.4 star for food. felt like food was cooked quick, slightly undercooked. 5 star for service. Will def stop by here for more food"
403,"I so wanted breakfast, My meeting ran late so I had to settle for the tacos. The grilled fish taco was good. The Tacos al pastor were ok. Not great although not bad. Tortillas are small although they make up for the amount of meat they put on. Salsa did not have much flavor. The staff was friendly and I will be back for the breakfast."
404,"Best spot in Berkeley for Mexican food.  My favorite is the baja fish taco, $5.50.  I thought it was expensive for one taco but it is huge!  They give a generous serving of fish, crema, cabbage, and tomatoes.  I love the breading of the fish, giving a nice crispy texture with moist fish inside, and the crema makes for a great flavor combo.  Delish!The horchata is really sweet, but becomes perfect when the ice melts.  This place has got friendly staff, a great vibe, is clean, has outside garden seating, and also boasts a parking lot in the back to top it off (no Berkeley street parking necessary)."
405,"Service was efficient and friendly, but La Mission's chicken dishes leave everything to be desired. If you eat pork, they have your back (the pozole for example), but the chicken is literally tiny dry cubes of meat with no flavor. I spent 17$ and change on two street tacos a small salad and one beer. Seemed outrageously high relative to the quality and amount of food. Maybe the other tacos are just so much more delicious? If I were them I would pull all the cubed chicken off the menu. The green salad was good, though sparse. I liked that it had pepitas, cabbage shreds and a vinaigrette dressing. Not sure I would come back just for that though with so many other amazing Mexican places around the area. Sad because I really wanted to love this place!"
406,"This is by far my favorite taco place in the bay area!The grand tacos here has 2 shells (1 soft 1 hard) and has more fillings than normal tacos. I normally go for the beef and the fish taco while my husband will have these 2 and a pork one as well. The fish is always crispy outside and tender inside, with a light dressing to compliment the flavor. The beef taco doesn't skim on the beef quantity like a lot other places. We also like the nachos here. In fact it is the favorite dish for my mother who comes from China. The service is slightly slow here but that's because they make everything fresh. It's a wait I'm willing to have for good quality food。"
407,Best Mexican food in Berkeley. Really really fresh meats and diverse vegetarian choices. Excellent moles and savory menudo. Perfect snacking for a summer afternoon.
408,"Mission Accomplished. Decent Mexican food found in Berkeley!Food: Have your pick from tacos to burritos, soups, entree plates, aguas frescas and even some fresh desserts if you're sweet tooth kicks in. I went with a simple and classic cheesy quesadilla, but added prawns to fancy it up a bit. Oozing with cheesy, grilled to near perfection and boasting with fresh flavors of chopped prawns; it was truly delicious. My friend ordered the Al Pastor Burrito which was packed with some of the best marinated and juicy chunks of meat we've ever had, he ordered it with everything, both of us were surprised the burrito didn't fall apart upon first bite. It was the perfect blend of fresh and savory ingredients all enclosed in a grilled and slightly charred flour tortilla. The salsa was the only issue as it wasn't nearly as spicy nor fresh as I hoped for. Chips are not free, that was a bummer as well. Other than that, the food was solid.Price: A bit steeper than your average casual Mexican eatery, but worth the price. Ambiance: Cozy and small interior, very tight and minimal seating, but they do have a huge outdoor patio equipped with tons of natural shading from the big trees. Parking lot is behind the building.Service: The young man that took our order greeted us with a genuine smile and was very patient. Same story with the young man that brought us our food.Overall: I was getting a bit tired of driving to Oakland for Mexican food, so I'm glad I finally found fresh and decent tasting Mexican food in Berkeley. Prices are a bit steeper than I'd like, but well worth the solid tasting food and wonderful service."
409,"I've come here several times and have had great experiences each time. Be it afternoon, evening, or night, this place has fantastic service and wonderful food.Tonight hubs and I had a beer each while waiting for our order (Santa Fe salad and chile rellenos). The total came to $36 and I tipped up to $42. Seating inside is 8 small-ish tables that seat 2/3 each (booth on the back). There is more seating outside.Even when lines get long, the food comes out fast and hot. The staff are extremely friendly. There's Tapatio and tobasco and other bottles hot sauces available if you dine in."
410,Came here after a wedding and the guys that work here followed us out to our car and took pictures of our license plate as we were trying to leave. They were accusing us of knowing somebody else who they thought hit their truck. Not only will we not be back but we will be following up with this issue as this was completely uncalled for. One of the workers wanted to fight us. That's not how you run a business.
411,"This place has great food. The menu is huge, and reasonably priced. Their breakfast burritos are on point! The food is mixed traditional, authentic Mexican food as well as MexicanAmerican food (burritos, nachos).Everybody here is pretty friendly,  and I think just about everything they make is made from scratch. While you can get your food to go, this is not a ""fast-food"" restaurant, really. It could be fun to sit down there also, there's lots of tables inside and outside. A majority of the food is fresh and made to order and comes out piping-hot off the grill. Don't confuse this with some local Berkeley Taco Bell. Mission is legit, awesome, awesome food."
412,"Hands down the best Mexican food in Berkeley. The mole poblano burrito, either with chicken or carnitas is excellent, and the platanos and beans are awesome. But let me reiterate- do not miss out on the amazing mole here!!!Casual atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating, in a quiet area of Berkeley far from the university. Food is delivered to your table quickly, service is nothing outstanding, but good enough.Food is priced well for how much food you get- I paid a bit over $10 for a burrito that's probably going to keep me full for two days lolol"
413,"We had a good experience at La Mission this afternoon. We ordered tacos de papa, cocktail, and tacos de Barbacoa. Tacos were delicious, cocktail filling, lots of shrimp. Juice and sangria were so so. But overall good experience. Fresh breeze, out door  seating and friendly staff!"
414,"Super awesome taqueria right on the main drag of university avenue.They have their own small parking lot behind the building accessible via chestnut st. in addition to the usual street parking.

The menu consists of the usual taqueria suspects-burrito, taco, combo platters with slightly more variety. They offer the full range of meats including barbacoa, lengua, camarón (shrimp) and several different varieties of fish. There are also three different stylings of veg burrito/tacos including vegan and grilled veg options, which is nice to see. The breakfast menu is especially strong, and they have an awesome salsa/condiment bar.  Pricing for these items is fairly standard for the area about three bucks a taco and everything else pretty much starts at 7 bucks. Typically a meal will run about ten dollars with a drink and add ons, but it's possible to go the bare bones bargain route for slightly less. It's the flavor, convenience, and quality of the food that really shines here.One of the better lunch/breakfast options for the area for sure."

No hiding the flavor of the meat with cheese, lettuce, beans, rice, guac, cream, etc. Pureza means PURITY!:::: Borrego -- MEH-EH-EH-EH. Lamb Barbacoa was gamy and dry. The marinade was decent, but not enough to rescue the meat. I had one bite of LAMB FAT that was great, though.:::: Al Pastor -- MEH'VERAGE. All around dry, barely tasted any pork fat. The shallow marinade tasted like mild Tapatio.:::: Carnitas -- GAR'MEHGE. Chipotle-vels of CarMEHtas failure. Didn't even taste like pork. More of a dry, cotton-mouthed protein filler. Awful.- BORED-TILLAS:::: Tortillas -- NEED LOTION. Dry, and in need of moisturizing from some oil. After 4 minutes, these unlotioned tortillas absorbed too much moisture, thus becoming doughy in places, and pretty gross.

438,"I understand from friends that the meat options are tasty, but the veggie and fish burritos and tacos I've had here were poor.The staff are always friendly, and you get nice thick chips, but nothing else has been good the three times I've visited."
439,I am no Mexican food expert but I thought their burrito was solid. I had a plain old vegetarian burrito without any extras like sour cream or guacamole and I also didn't get cheese. They give you a choice of black beans or refried. I super love their salsa offerings. The tomatillo salsa and the other one (I can't remember which) are both delicious and I totally drowned every bite of my burrito with both.The burrito itself was huge but was the perfect thing after I was famished from climbing. Definitely better than Monte Cristo up the street!
440,"TL;DR 5/5 carnitas tacosCame here during dinner time, line was not too bad. I ordered 3 tacos, carnitas, carne asada, and another something taco. The sauce, cilantro, onion, everything was the perfect taste and ratio. My favorite was the carnitas, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. They have a wide variety of items on their menu, and I will definitely be back to try the rest!This is my friend's top taco place in Berkeley, and I would also put this at the top of my list.La Mission is accessible via AC Transit 51B or car (small parking lot in the back)."
441,How come my simple to-go order can't be prepared correctly? Is asking for pico de gallo too complicated? I'm tired of getting home to find out that my food was made incorrectly. I try to keep any additions simple. I think I forgot why I like La Mission. I'm finished hoping you'll get my order right.
442,"we got off our night shift and went here for breakfast. There was no wait time at all, the restaurant just opened for the day. we were first customers. restaurant was very clean. There was a breakfast menu and we could order from full menu. we also ordered pitcher of sangria - which was  great.4 star for food. felt like food was cooked quick, slightly undercooked. 5 star for service. Will def stop by here for more food"
443,"I so wanted breakfast, My meeting ran late so I had to settle for the tacos. The grilled fish taco was good. The Tacos al pastor were ok. Not great although not bad. Tortillas are small although they make up for the amount of meat they put on. Salsa did not have much flavor. The staff was friendly and I will be back for the breakfast."
444,"Best spot in Berkeley for Mexican food.  My favorite is the baja fish taco, $5.50.  I thought it was expensive for one taco but it is huge!  They give a generous serving of fish, crema, cabbage, and tomatoes.  I love the breading of the fish, giving a nice crispy texture with moist fish inside, and the crema makes for a great flavor combo.  Delish!The horchata is really sweet, but becomes perfect when the ice melts.  This place has got friendly staff, a great vibe, is clean, has outside garden seating, and also boasts a parking lot in the back to top it off (no Berkeley street parking necessary)."
445,"Service was efficient and friendly, but La Mission's chicken dishes leave everything to be desired. If you eat pork, they have your back (the pozole for example), but the chicken is literally tiny dry cubes of meat with no flavor. I spent 17$ and change on two street tacos a small salad and one beer. Seemed outrageously high relative to the quality and amount of food. Maybe the other tacos are just so much more delicious? If I were them I would pull all the cubed chicken off the menu. The green salad was good, though sparse. I liked that it had pepitas, cabbage shreds and a vinaigrette dressing. Not sure I would come back just for that though with so many other amazing Mexican places around the area. Sad because I really wanted to love this place!"
446,"This is by far my favorite taco place in the bay area!The grand tacos here has 2 shells (1 soft 1 hard) and has more fillings than normal tacos. I normally go for the beef and the fish taco while my husband will have these 2 and a pork one as well. The fish is always crispy outside and tender inside, with a light dressing to compliment the flavor. The beef taco doesn't skim on the beef quantity like a lot other places. We also like the nachos here. In fact it is the favorite dish for my mother who comes from China. The service is slightly slow here but that's because they make everything fresh. It's a wait I'm willing to have for good quality food。"
447,Best Mexican food in Berkeley. Really really fresh meats and diverse vegetarian choices. Excellent moles and savory menudo. Perfect snacking for a summer afternoon.
448,"Mission Accomplished. Decent Mexican food found in Berkeley!Food: Have your pick from tacos to burritos, soups, entree plates, aguas frescas and even some fresh desserts if you're sweet tooth kicks in. I went with a simple and classic cheesy quesadilla, but added prawns to fancy it up a bit. Oozing with cheesy, grilled to near perfection and boasting with fresh flavors of chopped prawns; it was truly delicious. My friend ordered the Al Pastor Burrito which was packed with some of the best marinated and juicy chunks of meat we've ever had, he ordered it with everything, both of us were surprised the burrito didn't fall apart upon first bite. It was the perfect blend of fresh and savory ingredients all enclosed in a grilled and slightly charred flour tortilla. The salsa was the only issue as it wasn't nearly as spicy nor fresh as I hoped for. Chips are not free, that was a bummer as well. Other than that, the food was solid.Price: A bit steeper than your average casual Mexican eatery, but worth the price. Ambiance: Cozy and small interior, very tight and minimal seating, but they do have a huge outdoor patio equipped with tons of natural shading from the big trees. Parking lot is behind the building.Service: The young man that took our order greeted us with a genuine smile and was very patient. Same story with the young man that brought us our food.Overall: I was getting a bit tired of driving to Oakland for Mexican food, so I'm glad I finally found fresh and decent tasting Mexican food in Berkeley. Prices are a bit steeper than I'd like, but well worth the solid tasting food and wonderful service."
449,"I've come here several times and have had great experiences each time. Be it afternoon, evening, or night, this place has fantastic service and wonderful food.Tonight hubs and I had a beer each while waiting for our order (Santa Fe salad and chile rellenos). The total came to $36 and I tipped up to $42. Seating inside is 8 small-ish tables that seat 2/3 each (booth on the back). There is more seating outside.Even when lines get long, the food comes out fast and hot. The staff are extremely friendly. There's Tapatio and tobasco and other bottles hot sauces available if you dine in."
450,Came here after a wedding and the guys that work here followed us out to our car and took pictures of our license plate as we were trying to leave. They were accusing us of knowing somebody else who they thought hit their truck. Not only will we not be back but we will be following up with this issue as this was completely uncalled for. One of the workers wanted to fight us. That's not how you run a business.
451,"This place has great food. The menu is huge, and reasonably priced. Their breakfast burritos are on point! The food is mixed traditional, authentic Mexican food as well as MexicanAmerican food (burritos, nachos).Everybody here is pretty friendly,  and I think just about everything they make is made from scratch. While you can get your food to go, this is not a ""fast-food"" restaurant, really. It could be fun to sit down there also, there's lots of tables inside and outside. A majority of the food is fresh and made to order and comes out piping-hot off the grill. Don't confuse this with some local Berkeley Taco Bell. Mission is legit, awesome, awesome food."
452,"Hands down the best Mexican food in Berkeley. The mole poblano burrito, either with chicken or carnitas is excellent, and the platanos and beans are awesome. But let me reiterate- do not miss out on the amazing mole here!!!Casual atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating, in a quiet area of Berkeley far from the university. Food is delivered to your table quickly, service is nothing outstanding, but good enough.Food is priced well for how much food you get- I paid a bit over $10 for a burrito that's probably going to keep me full for two days lolol"
453,"We had a good experience at La Mission this afternoon. We ordered tacos de papa, cocktail, and tacos de Barbacoa. Tacos were delicious, cocktail filling, lots of shrimp. Juice and sangria were so so. But overall good experience. Fresh breeze, out door  seating and friendly staff!"
454,"Super awesome taqueria right on the main drag of university avenue.They have their own small parking lot behind the building accessible via chestnut st. in addition to the usual street parking. Usually there's a spot or two available at any given time, although the super popular lunch rush can be very busy.There is pleasing inside and outside seating. The outside seating is larger then most places of this type, and is particularly nice on a sunny day, what with the natural shade provided by several friendly trees. Inside seating is the usual booth/chair combos al fast food restaurant style.  the look of the place scream re-purposed fast food chain to me, but the owners have made it all their own local styling, even if the inside is dominated by the order counter.Service  is of the order and pick up when called model. The menu consists of the usual taqueria suspects-burrito, taco, combo platters with slightly more variety. They offer the full range of meats including barbacoa, lengua, camarón (shrimp) and several different varieties of fish. There are also three different stylings of veg burrito/tacos including vegan and grilled veg options, which is nice to see. The breakfast menu is especially strong, and they have an awesome salsa/condiment bar.  Pricing for these items is fairly standard for the area about three bucks a taco and everything else pretty much starts at 7 bucks. Typically a meal will run about ten dollars with a drink and add ons, but it's possible to go the bare bones bargain route for slightly less. It's the flavor, convenience, and quality of the food that really shines here.One of the better lunch/breakfast options for the area for sure."
455,"Solid, good, authentic mexican food.   Whether you want tacos, enchiladas, tortas, burritos, pozole, etc., this place does not disappoint.Highly recommend for the price and the service.  There is also a parking lot and great outdoor seating."
456,I have frequently passed by this place but never gave it any thought to stop by but with the recommendation we decided to stop in for lunch I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and good this place actually was Food: grilled chicken tacos & steak (good) blk beans & rice everything was fresh the food was heavy which I liked and I like the way the meat  was cut into small pieces because I definitely dislike big chunks of meat with a lot of fat Service: fastAmbience: gives u a little feel of a little taqueria in Mexico Conclusion: better than I thought I will definitely return I love their chicken tacos and their rice and beans everything was fresh very tasty very good light and healthy I would say give this place a try

480,"TL;DR 5/5 carnitas tacosCame here during dinner time, line was not too bad. I ordered 3 tacos, carnitas, carne asada, and another something taco. The sauce, cilantro, onion, everything was the perfect taste and ratio. My favorite was the carnitas, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. They have a wide variety of items on their menu, and I will definitely be back to try the rest!This is my friend's top taco place in Berkeley, and I would also put this at the top of my list.La Mission is accessible via AC Transit 51B or car (small parking lot in the back)."
481,How come my simple to-go order can't be prepared correctly? Is asking for pico de gallo too complicated? I'm tired of getting home to find out that my food was made incorrectly. I try to keep any additions simple. I think I forgot why I like La Mission. I'm finished hoping you'll get my order right.
482,"we got off our night shift and went here for breakfast. There was no wait time at all, the restaurant just opened for the day. we were first customers. restaurant was very clean. There was a breakfast menu and we could order from full menu. we also ordered pitcher of sangria - which was  great.4 star for food. felt like food was cooked quick, slightly undercooked. 5 star for service. Will def stop by here for more food"
483,"I so wanted breakfast, My meeting ran late so I had to settle for the tacos. The grilled fish taco was good. The Tacos al pastor were ok. Not great although not bad. Tortillas are small although they make up for the amount of meat they put on. Salsa did not have much flavor. The staff was friendly and I will be back for the breakfast."
484,"Best spot in Berkeley for Mexican food.  My favorite is the baja fish taco, $5.50.  I thought it was expensive for one taco but it is huge!  They give a generous serving of fish, crema, cabbage, and tomatoes.  I love the breading of the fish, giving a nice crispy texture with moist fish inside, and the crema makes for a great flavor combo.  Delish!The horchata is really sweet, but becomes perfect when the ice melts.  This place has got friendly staff, a great vibe, is clean, has outside garden seating, and also boasts a parking lot in the back to top it off (no Berkeley street parking necessary)."
485,"Service was efficient and friendly, but La Mission's chicken dishes leave everything to be desired. If you eat pork, they have your back (the pozole for example), but the chicken is literally tiny dry cubes of meat with no flavor. I spent 17$ and change on two street tacos a small salad and one beer. Seemed outrageously high relative to the quality and amount of food. Maybe the other tacos are just so much more delicious? If I were them I would pull all the cubed chicken off the menu. The green salad was good, though sparse. I liked that it had pepitas, cabbage shreds and a vinaigrette dressing. Not sure I would come back just for that though with so many other amazing Mexican places around the area. Sad because I really wanted to love this place!"
486,"This is by far my favorite taco place in the bay area!The grand tacos here has 2 shells (1 soft 1 hard) and has more fillings than normal tacos. I normally go for the beef and the fish taco while my husband will have these 2 and a pork one as well. The fish is always crispy outside and tender inside, with a light dressing to compliment the flavor. The beef taco doesn't skim on the beef quantity like a lot other places. We also like the nachos here. In fact it is the favorite dish for my mother who comes from China. The service is slightly slow here but that's because they make everything fresh. It's a wait I'm willing to have for good quality food。"
487,Best Mexican food in Berkeley. Really really fresh meats and diverse vegetarian choices. Excellent moles and savory menudo. Perfect snacking for a summer afternoon.
488,"Mission Accomplished. Decent Mexican food found in Berkeley!Food: Have your pick from tacos to burritos, soups, entree plates, aguas frescas and even some fresh desserts if you're sweet tooth kicks in. I went with a simple and classic cheesy quesadilla, but added prawns to fancy it up a bit. Oozing with cheesy, grilled to near perfection and boasting with fresh flavors of chopped prawns; it was truly delicious. My friend ordered the Al Pastor Burrito which was packed with some of the best marinated and juicy chunks of meat we've ever had, he ordered it with everything, both of us were surprised the burrito didn't fall apart upon first bite. It was the perfect blend of fresh and savory ingredients all enclosed in a grilled and slightly charred flour tortilla. The salsa was the only issue as it wasn't nearly as spicy nor fresh as I hoped for. Chips are not free, that was a bummer as well. Other than that, the food was solid.Price: A bit steeper than your average casual Mexican eatery, but worth the price. Ambiance: Cozy and small interior, very tight and minimal seating, but they do have a huge outdoor patio equipped with tons of natural shading from the big trees. Parking lot is behind the building.Service: The young man that took our order greeted us with a genuine smile and was very patient. Same story with the young man that brought us our food.Overall: I was getting a bit tired of driving to Oakland for Mexican food, so I'm glad I finally found fresh and decent tasting Mexican food in Berkeley. Prices are a bit steeper than I'd like, but well worth the solid tasting food and wonderful service."
489,"I've come here several times and have had great experiences each time. Be it afternoon, evening, or night, this place has fantastic service and wonderful food.Tonight hubs and I had a beer each while waiting for our order (Santa Fe salad and chile rellenos). The total came to $36 and I tipped up to $42. Seating inside is 8 small-ish tables that seat 2/3 each (booth on the back). There is more seating outside.Even when lines get long, the food comes out fast and hot. The staff are extremely friendly. There's Tapatio and tobasco and other bottles hot sauces available if you dine in."
490,Came here after a wedding and the guys that work here followed us out to our car and took pictures of our license plate as we were trying to leave. They were accusing us of knowing somebody else who they thought hit their truck. Not only will we not be back but we will be following up with this issue as this was completely uncalled for. One of the workers wanted to fight us. That's not how you run a business.
491,"This place has great food. The menu is huge, and reasonably priced. Their breakfast burritos are on point! The food is mixed traditional, authentic Mexican food as well as MexicanAmerican food (burritos, nachos).Everybody here is pretty friendly,  and I think just about everything they make is made from scratch. While you can get your food to go, this is not a ""fast-food"" restaurant, really. It could be fun to sit down there also, there's lots of tables inside and outside. A majority of the food is fresh and made to order and comes out piping-hot off the grill. Don't confuse this with some local Berkeley Taco Bell. Mission is legit, awesome, awesome food."
492,"Hands down the best Mexican food in Berkeley. The mole poblano burrito, either with chicken or carnitas is excellent, and the platanos and beans are awesome. But let me reiterate- do not miss out on the amazing mole here!!!Casual atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating, in a quiet area of Berkeley far from the university. Food is delivered to your table quickly, service is nothing outstanding, but good enough.Food is priced well for how much food you get- I paid a bit over $10 for a burrito that's probably going to keep me full for two days lolol"
493,"We had a good experience at La Mission this afternoon. We ordered tacos de papa, cocktail, and tacos de Barbacoa. Tacos were delicious, cocktail filling, lots of shrimp. Juice and sangria were so so. But overall good experience. Fresh breeze, out door  seating and friendly staff!"
494,"Super awesome taqueria right on the main drag of university avenue.They have their own small parking lot behind the building accessible via chestnut st. in addition to the usual street parking. Usually there's a spot or two available at any given time, although the super popular lunch rush can be very busy.There is pleasing inside and outside seating. The outside seating is larger then most places of this type, and is particularly nice on a sunny day, what with the natural shade provided by several friendly trees. Inside seating is the usual booth/chair combos al fast food restaurant style.  the look of the place scream re-purposed fast food chain to me, but the owners have made it all their own local styling, even if the inside is dominated by the order counter.Service  is of the order and pick up when called model. The menu consists of the usual taqueria suspects-burrito, taco, combo platters with slightly more variety. They offer the full range of meats including barbacoa, lengua, camarón (shrimp) and several different varieties of fish. There are also three different stylings of veg burrito/tacos including vegan and grilled veg options, which is nice to see. The breakfast menu is especially strong, and they have an awesome salsa/condiment bar.  Pricing for these items is fairly standard for the area about three bucks a taco and everything else pretty much starts at 7 bucks. Typically a meal will run about ten dollars with a drink and add ons, but it's possible to go the bare bones bargain route for slightly less. It's the flavor, convenience, and quality of the food that really shines here.One of the better lunch/breakfast options for the area for sure."
495,"Solid, good, authentic mexican food.   Whether you want tacos, enchiladas, tortas, burritos, pozole, etc., this place does not disappoint.Highly recommend for the price and the service.  There is also a parking lot and great outdoor seating."
496,I have frequently passed by this place but never gave it any thought to stop by but with the recommendation we decided to stop in for lunch I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and good this place actually was Food: grilled chicken tacos & steak (good) blk beans & rice everything was fresh the food was heavy which I liked and I like the way the meat  was cut into small pieces because I definitely dislike big chunks of meat with a lot of fat Service: fastAmbience: gives u a little feel of a little taqueria in Mexico Conclusion: better than I thought I will definitely return I love their chicken tacos and their rice and beans everything was fresh very tasty very good light and healthy I would say give this place a try
497,"Taco Trek Lesson 3, THE TORTILLA. The CORN tortilla is the double-layered  backbone of the taco experience, setting the tone for moisture and texture throughout the bite. The flavor of the corn is the floor upon which the flavors of the meat, fat, and toppings dance the Salsa! When talk-talking tacos, there are two types of corn tortillas to consider: fresh-made and factory-made.* Fresh tortillas are rare. If you're lucky enough to find tortillas rolled out ON-THE-SPOT from a press, quality is a WRAP! Fresh corn tortillas are always perfectly moist and tender, and need minimal added fat. The experience is like eating supple wontons or dumplings; the fresh tortilla is as pliable as soft cloth, and the corn never wads up into dry unpleasantness in the back of your mouth. Fresh tortillas, however, have zero shelf-life, and thus we get to...* Factory tortillas, which are common. Tortillas made in a factory have added preservatives and binding agents that make them dense, dry, and disgusting -- but they can be made awesome again through the absorption of enough fat on a hot griddle! Simply steaming factory tortillas is UNACCEPTABLE to a tacossieur like me, because they get doughy and taste acidic. Automatic Taco Fail!* Pro-tip: You can tell the QUALITY of a corn tortilla just from a TACO PHOTO. :::: Positively Awesome: 1) Round corners at the folds, 2) Oil-stained, deep color, 3) some shine on the surface -- tender and moist, let's rejoice! 4) Greased spots of golden-brown -- crisped on the griddle to be chewy in the middle!:::: God-Awful: 1) Sharp corners at the folded edges -- MEH, mostly dry. 2) Light-colored, dry-looking surface -- cotton-mouth!

Check out my TACO TREK LIST to get you started.3   M I N U S E S- FAILS de CARNESRemember, tacos are all about delivering delicious MEAT-DECADENCE into your mouth. No hiding the flavor of the meat with cheese, lettuce, beans, rice, guac, cream, etc. Pureza means PURITY!:::: Borrego -- MEH-EH-EH-EH. Lamb Barbacoa was gamy and dry. The marinade was decent, but not enough to rescue the meat. I had one bite of LAMB FAT that was great, though.:::: Al Pastor -- MEH'VERAGE. All around dry, barely tasted any pork fat. The shallow marinade tasted like mild Tapatio.:::: Carnitas -- GAR'MEHGE. Chipotle-vels of CarMEHtas failure. Didn't even taste like pork. More of a dry, cotton-mouthed protein filler. Awful.- BORED-TILLAS:::: Tortillas -- NEED LOTION. Dry, and in need of moisturizing from some oil. After 4 minutes, these unlotioned tortillas absorbed too much moisture, thus becoming doughy in places, and pretty gross. Folks who prefer flour tortillas to corn tortillas do so because of tortillas LIKE THESE.- GRINGOFIED MENUMeat quality is automatically suspect if certain authentic and standard carnes aren't on the menu: no cabeza, no lengua, no tripe... This probably means that the clientele is inexperienced, and thus these delicacies will go unordered.

499,I am no Mexican food expert but I thought their burrito was solid. I had a plain old vegetarian burrito without any extras like sour cream or guacamole and I also didn't get cheese.

If I were them I would pull all the cubed chicken off the menu. The green salad was good, though sparse. I liked that it had pepitas, cabbage shreds and a vinaigrette dressing. Not sure I would come back just for that though with so many other amazing Mexican places around the area. Sad because I really wanted to love this place!"
526,"This is by far my favorite taco place in the bay area!The grand tacos here has 2 shells (1 soft 1 hard) and has more fillings than normal tacos. I normally go for the beef and the fish taco while my husband will have these 2 and a pork one as well. The fish is always crispy outside and tender inside, with a light dressing to compliment the flavor. The beef taco doesn't skim on the beef quantity like a lot other places. We also like the nachos here. In fact it is the favorite dish for my mother who comes from China. The service is slightly slow here but that's because they make everything fresh. It's a wait I'm willing to have for good quality food。"
527,Best Mexican food in Berkeley. Really really fresh meats and diverse vegetarian choices. Excellent moles and savory menudo. Perfect snacking for a summer afternoon.
528,"Mission Accomplished. Decent Mexican food found in Berkeley!Food: Have your pick from tacos to burritos, soups, entree plates, aguas frescas and even some fresh desserts if you're sweet tooth kicks in. I went with a simple and classic cheesy quesadilla, but added prawns to fancy it up a bit. Oozing with cheesy, grilled to near perfection and boasting with fresh flavors of chopped prawns; it was truly delicious. My friend ordered the Al Pastor Burrito which was packed with some of the best marinated and juicy chunks of meat we've ever had, he ordered it with everything, both of us were surprised the burrito didn't fall apart upon first bite. It was the perfect blend of fresh and savory ingredients all enclosed in a grilled and slightly charred flour tortilla. The salsa was the only issue as it wasn't nearly as spicy nor fresh as I hoped for. Chips are not free, that was a bummer as well. Other than that, the food was solid.Price: A bit steeper than your average casual Mexican eatery, but worth the price. Ambiance: Cozy and small interior, very tight and minimal seating, but they do have a huge outdoor patio equipped with tons of natural shading from the big trees. Parking lot is behind the building.Service: The young man that took our order greeted us with a genuine smile and was very patient. Same story with the young man that brought us our food.Overall: I was getting a bit tired of driving to Oakland for Mexican food, so I'm glad I finally found fresh and decent tasting Mexican food in Berkeley. Prices are a bit steeper than I'd like, but well worth the solid tasting food and wonderful service."
529,"I've come here several times and have had great experiences each time. Be it afternoon, evening, or night, this place has fantastic service and wonderful food.Tonight hubs and I had a beer each while waiting for our order (Santa Fe salad and chile rellenos). The total came to $36 and I tipped up to $42. Seating inside is 8 small-ish tables that seat 2/3 each (booth on the back). There is more seating outside.Even when lines get long, the food comes out fast and hot. The staff are extremely friendly. There's Tapatio and tobasco and other bottles hot sauces available if you dine in."
530,Came here after a wedding and the guys that work here followed us out to our car and took pictures of our license plate as we were trying to leave. They were accusing us of knowing somebody else who they thought hit their truck. Not only will we not be back but we will be following up with this issue as this was completely uncalled for. One of the workers wanted to fight us. That's not how you run a business.
531,"This place has great food. The menu is huge, and reasonably priced. Their breakfast burritos are on point! The food is mixed traditional, authentic Mexican food as well as MexicanAmerican food (burritos, nachos).Everybody here is pretty friendly,  and I think just about everything they make is made from scratch. While you can get your food to go, this is not a ""fast-food"" restaurant, really. It could be fun to sit down there also, there's lots of tables inside and outside. A majority of the food is fresh and made to order and comes out piping-hot off the grill. Don't confuse this with some local Berkeley Taco Bell. Mission is legit, awesome, awesome food."
532,"Hands down the best Mexican food in Berkeley. The mole poblano burrito, either with chicken or carnitas is excellent, and the platanos and beans are awesome. But let me reiterate- do not miss out on the amazing mole here!!!Casual atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating, in a quiet area of Berkeley far from the university. Food is delivered to your table quickly, service is nothing outstanding, but good enough.Food is priced well for how much food you get- I paid a bit over $10 for a burrito that's probably going to keep me full for two days lolol"
533,"We had a good experience at La Mission this afternoon. We ordered tacos de papa, cocktail, and tacos de Barbacoa. Tacos were delicious, cocktail filling, lots of shrimp. Juice and sangria were so so. But overall good experience. Fresh breeze, out door  seating and friendly staff!"
534,"Super awesome taqueria right on the main drag of university avenue.They have their own small parking lot behind the building accessible via chestnut st. in addition to the usual street parking. Usually there's a spot or two available at any given time, although the super popular lunch rush can be very busy.There is pleasing inside and outside seating. The outside seating is larger then most places of this type, and is particularly nice on a sunny day, what with the natural shade provided by several friendly trees. Inside seating is the usual booth/chair combos al fast food restaurant style.  the look of the place scream re-purposed fast food chain to me, but the owners have made it all their own local styling, even if the inside is dominated by the order counter.Service  is of the order and pick up when called model. The menu consists of the usual taqueria suspects-burrito, taco, combo platters with slightly more variety. They offer the full range of meats including barbacoa, lengua, camarón (shrimp) and several different varieties of fish. There are also three different stylings of veg burrito/tacos including vegan and grilled veg options, which is nice to see. The breakfast menu is especially strong, and they have an awesome salsa/condiment bar.  Pricing for these items is fairly standard for the area about three bucks a taco and everything else pretty much starts at 7 bucks. Typically a meal will run about ten dollars with a drink and add ons, but it's possible to go the bare bones bargain route for slightly less. It's the flavor, convenience, and quality of the food that really shines here.One of the better lunch/breakfast options for the area for sure."
535,"Solid, good, authentic mexican food.   Whether you want tacos, enchiladas, tortas, burritos, pozole, etc., this place does not disappoint.Highly recommend for the price and the service.  There is also a parking lot and great outdoor seating."
536,I have frequently passed by this place but never gave it any thought to stop by but with the recommendation we decided to stop in for lunch I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and good this place actually was Food: grilled chicken tacos & steak (good) blk beans & rice everything was fresh the food was heavy which I liked and I like the way the meat  was cut into small pieces because I definitely dislike big chunks of meat with a lot of fat Service: fastAmbience: gives u a little feel of a little taqueria in Mexico Conclusion: better than I thought I will definitely return I love their chicken tacos and their rice and beans everything was fresh very tasty very good light and healthy I would say give this place a try
537,"Taco Trek Lesson 3, THE TORTILLA. The CORN tortilla is the double-layered  backbone of the taco experience, setting the tone for moisture and texture throughout the bite. The flavor of the corn is the floor upon which the flavors of the meat, fat, and toppings dance the Salsa! When talk-talking tacos, there are two types of corn tortillas to consider: fresh-made and factory-made.* Fresh tortillas are rare. If you're lucky enough to find tortillas rolled out ON-THE-SPOT from a press, quality is a WRAP! Fresh corn tortillas are always perfectly moist and tender, and need minimal added fat. The experience is like eating supple wontons or dumplings; the fresh tortilla is as pliable as soft cloth, and the corn never wads up into dry unpleasantness in the back of your mouth. Fresh tortillas, however, have zero shelf-life, and thus we get to...* Factory tortillas, which are common. Tortillas made in a factory have added preservatives and binding agents that make them dense, dry, and disgusting -- but they can be made awesome again through the absorption of enough fat on a hot griddle! Simply steaming factory tortillas is UNACCEPTABLE to a tacossieur like me, because they get doughy and taste acidic. Automatic Taco Fail!* Pro-tip: You can tell the QUALITY of a corn tortilla just from a TACO PHOTO. :::: Positively Awesome: 1) Round corners at the folds, 2) Oil-stained, deep color, 3) some shine on the surface -- tender and moist, let's rejoice! 4) Greased spots of golden-brown -- crisped on the griddle to be chewy in the middle!:::: God-Awful: 1) Sharp corners at the folded edges -- MEH, mostly dry. 2) Light-colored, dry-looking surface -- cotton-mouth! Keep away! 3) Wet, doughy-looking surface (sure sign of gringo tacos) -- acidic YUCKTOWN._______ Strictly a review of La Mission's TACOS _______Tacos were sadly MEH-diocre. I suspect the overall 4-star review was was given by burrito-eaters that are HIGHLY FORGIVING of crappy meats. Time to take a BART ride to the Fruitvale for some real-deal taco trucks, my Gringos. Check out my TACO TREK LIST to get you started.3   M I N U S E S- FAILS de CARNESRemember, tacos are all about delivering delicious MEAT-DECADENCE into your mouth. No hiding the flavor of the meat with cheese, lettuce, beans, rice, guac, cream, etc. Pureza means PURITY!:::: Borrego -- MEH-EH-EH-EH. Lamb Barbacoa was gamy and dry. The marinade was decent, but not enough to rescue the meat. I had one bite of LAMB FAT that was great, though.:::: Al Pastor -- MEH'VERAGE. All around dry, barely tasted any pork fat. The shallow marinade tasted like mild Tapatio.:::: Carnitas -- GAR'MEHGE. Chipotle-vels of CarMEHtas failure. Didn't even taste like pork. More of a dry, cotton-mouthed protein filler. Awful.- BORED-TILLAS:::: Tortillas -- NEED LOTION. Dry, and in need of moisturizing from some oil. After 4 minutes, these unlotioned tortillas absorbed too much moisture, thus becoming doughy in places, and pretty gross. Folks who prefer flour tortillas to corn tortillas do so because of tortillas LIKE THESE.- GRINGOFIED MENUMeat quality is automatically suspect if certain authentic and standard carnes aren't on the menu: no cabeza, no lengua, no tripe... This probably means that the clientele is inexperienced, and thus these delicacies will go unordered. This probably also means that the meats that are on the menu aren't going to be that awesome because the aforementioned inexperienced clientele will not demand quality.2   S T A R S* STEAK'ED THEIR CLAIM:::: Carne Asada Taco -- PURDY GOOD.

538,"I understand from friends that the meat options are tasty, but the veggie and fish burritos and tacos I've had here were poor.The staff are always friendly, and you get nice thick chips, but nothing else has been good the three times I've visited."
539,I am no Mexican food expert but I thought their burrito was solid. I had a plain old vegetarian burrito without any extras like sour cream or guacamole and I also didn't get cheese. They give you a choice of black beans or refried. I super love their salsa offerings. The tomatillo salsa and the other one (I can't remember which) are both delicious and I totally drowned every bite of my burrito with both.The burrito itself was huge but was the perfect thing after I was famished from climbing. Definitely better than Monte Cristo up the street!
540,"TL;DR 5/5 carnitas tacosCame here during dinner time, line was not too bad. I ordered 3 tacos, carnitas, carne asada, and another something taco. The sauce, cilantro, onion, everything was the perfect taste and ratio. My favorite was the carnitas, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. They have a wide variety of items on their menu, and I will definitely be back to try the rest!This is my friend's top taco place in Berkeley, and I would also put this at the top of my list.La Mission is accessible via AC Transit 51B or car (small parking lot in the back)."
541,How come my simple to-go order can't be prepared correctly? Is asking for pico de gallo too complicated? I'm tired of getting home to find out that my food was made incorrectly. I try to keep any additions simple. I think I forgot why I like La Mission. I'm finished hoping you'll get my order right.
542,"we got off our night shift and went here for breakfast. There was no wait time at all, the restaurant just opened for the day. we were first customers. restaurant was very clean. There was a breakfast menu and we could order from full menu. we also ordered pitcher of sangria - which was  great.4 star for food. felt like food was cooked quick, slightly undercooked. 5 star for service. Will def stop by here for more food"
543,"I so wanted breakfast, My meeting ran late so I had to settle for the tacos. The grilled fish taco was good. The Tacos al pastor were ok. Not great although not bad. Tortillas are small although they make up for the amount of meat they put on. Salsa did not have much flavor. The staff was friendly and I will be back for the breakfast."
544,"Best spot in Berkeley for Mexican food.  My favorite is the baja fish taco, $5.50.  I thought it was expensive for one taco but it is huge!  They give a generous serving of fish, crema, cabbage, and tomatoes.  I love the breading of the fish, giving a nice crispy texture with moist fish inside, and the crema makes for a great flavor combo.  Delish!The horchata is really sweet, but becomes perfect when the ice melts.  This place has got friendly staff, a great vibe, is clean, has outside garden seating, and also boasts a parking lot in the back to top it off (no Berkeley street parking necessary)."

Be it afternoon, evening, or night, this place has fantastic service and wonderful food.Tonight hubs and I had a beer each while waiting for our order (Santa Fe salad and chile rellenos). The total came to $36 and I tipped up to $42. Seating inside is 8 small-ish tables that seat 2/3 each (booth on the back). There is more seating outside.Even when lines get long, the food comes out fast and hot. The staff are extremely friendly. There's Tapatio and tobasco and other bottles hot sauces available if you dine in."
570,Came here after a wedding and the guys that work here followed us out to our car and took pictures of our license plate as we were trying to leave. They were accusing us of knowing somebody else who they thought hit their truck. Not only will we not be back but we will be following up with this issue as this was completely uncalled for. One of the workers wanted to fight us. That's not how you run a business.
571,"This place has great food. The menu is huge, and reasonably priced. Their breakfast burritos are on point! The food is mixed traditional, authentic Mexican food as well as MexicanAmerican food (burritos, nachos).Everybody here is pretty friendly,  and I think just about everything they make is made from scratch. While you can get your food to go, this is not a ""fast-food"" restaurant, really. It could be fun to sit down there also, there's lots of tables inside and outside. A majority of the food is fresh and made to order and comes out piping-hot off the grill. Don't confuse this with some local Berkeley Taco Bell. Mission is legit, awesome, awesome food."
572,"Hands down the best Mexican food in Berkeley. The mole poblano burrito, either with chicken or carnitas is excellent, and the platanos and beans are awesome. But let me reiterate- do not miss out on the amazing mole here!!!Casual atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating, in a quiet area of Berkeley far from the university. Food is delivered to your table quickly, service is nothing outstanding, but good enough.Food is priced well for how much food you get- I paid a bit over $10 for a burrito that's probably going to keep me full for two days lolol"
573,"We had a good experience at La Mission this afternoon. We ordered tacos de papa, cocktail, and tacos de Barbacoa. Tacos were delicious, cocktail filling, lots of shrimp. Juice and sangria were so so. But overall good experience. Fresh breeze, out door  seating and friendly staff!"
574,"Super awesome taqueria right on the main drag of university avenue.They have their own small parking lot behind the building accessible via chestnut st. in addition to the usual street parking. Usually there's a spot or two available at any given time, although the super popular lunch rush can be very busy.There is pleasing inside and outside seating. The outside seating is larger then most places of this type, and is particularly nice on a sunny day, what with the natural shade provided by several friendly trees. Inside seating is the usual booth/chair combos al fast food restaurant style.  the look of the place scream re-purposed fast food chain to me, but the owners have made it all their own local styling, even if the inside is dominated by the order counter.Service  is of the order and pick up when called model. The menu consists of the usual taqueria suspects-burrito, taco, combo platters with slightly more variety. They offer the full range of meats including barbacoa, lengua, camarón (shrimp) and several different varieties of fish. There are also three different stylings of veg burrito/tacos including vegan and grilled veg options, which is nice to see. The breakfast menu is especially strong, and they have an awesome salsa/condiment bar.  Pricing for these items is fairly standard for the area about three bucks a taco and everything else pretty much starts at 7 bucks. Typically a meal will run about ten dollars with a drink and add ons, but it's possible to go the bare bones bargain route for slightly less. It's the flavor, convenience, and quality of the food that really shines here.One of the better lunch/breakfast options for the area for sure."
575,"Solid, good, authentic mexican food.   Whether you want tacos, enchiladas, tortas, burritos, pozole, etc., this place does not disappoint.Highly recommend for the price and the service.  There is also a parking lot and great outdoor seating."
576,I have frequently passed by this place but never gave it any thought to stop by but with the recommendation we decided to stop in for lunch I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and good this place actually was Food: grilled chicken tacos & steak (good) blk beans & rice everything was fresh the food was heavy which I liked and I like the way the meat  was cut into small pieces because I definitely dislike big chunks of meat with a lot of fat Service: fastAmbience: gives u a little feel of a little taqueria in Mexico Conclusion: better than I thought I will definitely return I love their chicken tacos and their rice and beans everything was fresh very tasty very good light and healthy I would say give this place a try
577,"Taco Trek Lesson 3, THE TORTILLA. The CORN tortilla is the double-layered  backbone of the taco experience, setting the tone for moisture and texture throughout the bite. The flavor of the corn is the floor upon which the flavors of the meat, fat, and toppings dance the Salsa! When talk-talking tacos, there are two types of corn tortillas to consider: fresh-made and factory-made.* Fresh tortillas are rare. If you're lucky enough to find tortillas rolled out ON-THE-SPOT from a press, quality is a WRAP! Fresh corn tortillas are always perfectly moist and tender, and need minimal added fat. The experience is like eating supple wontons or dumplings; the fresh tortilla is as pliable as soft cloth, and the corn never wads up into dry unpleasantness in the back of your mouth. Fresh tortillas, however, have zero shelf-life, and thus we get to...* Factory tortillas, which are common. Tortillas made in a factory have added preservatives and binding agents that make them dense, dry, and disgusting -- but they can be made awesome again through the absorption of enough fat on a hot griddle! Simply steaming factory tortillas is UNACCEPTABLE to a tacossieur like me, because they get doughy and taste acidic. Automatic Taco Fail!* Pro-tip: You can tell the QUALITY of a corn tortilla just from a TACO PHOTO. :::: Positively Awesome: 1) Round corners at the folds, 2) Oil-stained, deep color, 3) some shine on the surface -- tender and moist, let's rejoice! 4) Greased spots of golden-brown -- crisped on the griddle to be chewy in the middle!:::: God-Awful: 1) Sharp corners at the folded edges -- MEH, mostly dry. 2) Light-colored, dry-looking surface -- cotton-mouth! Keep away! 3) Wet, doughy-looking surface (sure sign of gringo tacos) -- acidic YUCKTOWN._______ Strictly a review of La Mission's TACOS _______Tacos were sadly MEH-diocre. I suspect the overall 4-star review was was given by burrito-eaters that are HIGHLY FORGIVING of crappy meats. Time to take a BART ride to the Fruitvale for some real-deal taco trucks, my Gringos. Check out my TACO TREK LIST to get you started.3   M I N U S E S- FAILS de CARNESRemember, tacos are all about delivering delicious MEAT-DECADENCE into your mouth. No hiding the flavor of the meat with cheese, lettuce, beans, rice, guac, cream, etc. Pureza means PURITY!:::: Borrego -- MEH-EH-EH-EH. Lamb Barbacoa was gamy and dry. The marinade was decent, but not enough to rescue the meat. I had one bite of LAMB FAT that was great, though.:::: Al Pastor -- MEH'VERAGE. All around dry, barely tasted any pork fat. The shallow marinade tasted like mild Tapatio.:::: Carnitas -- GAR'MEHGE. Chipotle-vels of CarMEHtas failure. Didn't even taste like pork. More of a dry, cotton-mouthed protein filler. Awful.- BORED-TILLAS:::: Tortillas -- NEED LOTION. Dry, and in need of moisturizing from some oil. After 4 minutes, these unlotioned tortillas absorbed too much moisture, thus becoming doughy in places, and pretty gross. Folks who prefer flour tortillas to corn tortillas do so because of tortillas LIKE THESE.- GRINGOFIED MENUMeat quality is automatically suspect if certain authentic and standard carnes aren't on the menu: no cabeza, no lengua, no tripe... This probably means that the clientele is inexperienced, and thus these delicacies will go unordered. This probably also means that the meats that are on the menu aren't going to be that awesome because the aforementioned inexperienced clientele will not demand quality.2   S T A R S* STEAK'ED THEIR CLAIM:::: Carne Asada Taco -- PURDY GOOD. Although the morsels alone seemed dry, biting into a mouthful of steak produced lovely moisture, and smoky flavor.*(1/2) BRIGHT-EYED SERVICEWelcoming, attentive, and bright-eyed friendliness from everyone I interacted with. Thank you so much guys!*(1/2) LOVELY OUTDOOR SPACEBring your beer to the pretty lil outdoor space with a trellis for shade, and enough tables to seat about 20."
578,"I understand from friends that the meat options are tasty, but the veggie and fish burritos and tacos I've had here were poor.The staff are always friendly, and you get nice thick chips, but nothing else has been good the three times I've visited."
579,I am no Mexican food expert but I thought their burrito was solid. I had a plain old vegetarian burrito without any extras like sour cream or guacamole and I also didn't get cheese. They give you a choice of black beans or refried. I super love their salsa offerings. The tomatillo salsa and the other one (I can't remember which) are both delicious and I totally drowned every bite of my burrito with both.The burrito itself was huge but was the perfect thing after I was famished from climbing. Definitely better than Monte Cristo up the street!
580,"TL;DR 5/5 carnitas tacosCame here during dinner time, line was not too bad. I ordered 3 tacos, carnitas, carne asada, and another something taco. The sauce, cilantro, onion, everything was the perfect taste and ratio. My favorite was the carnitas, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. They have a wide variety of items on their menu, and I will definitely be back to try the rest!This is my friend's top taco place in Berkeley, and I would also put this at the top of my list.La Mission is accessible via AC Transit 51B or car (small parking lot in the back)."
581,How come my simple to-go order can't be prepared correctly? Is asking for pico de gallo too complicated? I'm tired of getting home to find out that my food was made incorrectly. I try to keep any additions simple. I think I forgot why I like La Mission. I'm finished hoping you'll get my order right.
582,"we got off our night shift and went here for breakfast. There was no wait time at all, the restaurant just opened for the day. we were first customers. restaurant was very clean. There was a breakfast menu and we could order from full menu. we also ordered pitcher of sangria - which was  great.4 star for food. felt like food was cooked quick, slightly undercooked. 5 star for service. Will def stop by here for more food"
583,"I so wanted breakfast, My meeting ran late so I had to settle for the tacos. The grilled fish taco was good. The Tacos al pastor were ok. Not great although not bad. Tortillas are small although they make up for the amount of meat they put on. Salsa did not have much flavor. The staff was friendly and I will be back for the breakfast."
584,"Best spot in Berkeley for Mexican food.  My favorite is the baja fish taco, $5.50.  I thought it was expensive for one taco but it is huge!  They give a generous serving of fish, crema, cabbage, and tomatoes.  I love the breading of the fish, giving a nice crispy texture with moist fish inside, and the crema makes for a great flavor combo.  Delish!The horchata is really sweet, but becomes perfect when the ice melts.  This place has got friendly staff, a great vibe, is clean, has outside garden seating, and also boasts a parking lot in the back to top it off (no Berkeley street parking necessary)."
585,"Service was efficient and friendly, but La Mission's chicken dishes leave everything to be desired. If you eat pork, they have your back (the pozole for example), but the chicken is literally tiny dry cubes of meat with no flavor. I spent 17$ and change on two street tacos a small salad and one beer. Seemed outrageously high relative to the quality and amount of food. Maybe the other tacos are just so much more delicious? If I were them I would pull all the cubed chicken off the menu. The green salad was good, though sparse. I liked that it had pepitas, cabbage shreds and a vinaigrette dressing. Not sure I would come back just for that though with so many other amazing Mexican places around the area. Sad because I really wanted to love this place!"
586,"This is by far my favorite taco place in the bay area!The grand tacos here has 2 shells (1 soft 1 hard) and has more fillings than normal tacos. I normally go for the beef and the fish taco while my husband will have these 2 and a pork one as well. The fish is always crispy outside and tender inside, with a light dressing to compliment the flavor. The beef taco doesn't skim on the beef quantity like a lot other places. We also like the nachos here. In fact it is the favorite dish for my mother who comes from China. The service is slightly slow here but that's because they make everything fresh. It's a wait I'm willing to have for good quality food。"
587,Best Mexican food in Berkeley. Really really fresh meats and diverse vegetarian choices. Excellent moles and savory menudo. Perfect snacking for a summer afternoon.
588,"Mission Accomplished. Decent Mexican food found in Berkeley!Food: Have your pick from tacos to burritos, soups, entree plates, aguas frescas and even some fresh desserts if you're sweet tooth kicks in. I went with a simple and classic cheesy quesadilla, but added prawns to fancy it up a bit. Oozing with cheesy, grilled to near perfection and boasting with fresh flavors of chopped prawns; it was truly delicious. My friend ordered the Al Pastor Burrito which was packed with some of the best marinated and juicy chunks of meat we've ever had, he ordered it with everything, both of us were surprised the burrito didn't fall apart upon first bite. It was the perfect blend of fresh and savory ingredients all enclosed in a grilled and slightly charred flour tortilla. The salsa was the only issue as it wasn't nearly as spicy nor fresh as I hoped for. Chips are not free, that was a bummer as well. Other than that, the food was solid.Price: A bit steeper than your average casual Mexican eatery, but worth the price. Ambiance: Cozy and small interior, very tight and minimal seating, but they do have a huge outdoor patio equipped with tons of natural shading from the big trees. Parking lot is behind the building.Service: The young man that took our order greeted us with a genuine smile and was very patient. Same story with the young man that brought us our food.Overall: I was getting a bit tired of driving to Oakland for Mexican food, so I'm glad I finally found fresh and decent tasting Mexican food in Berkeley. Prices are a bit steeper than I'd like, but well worth the solid tasting food and wonderful service."

The menu consists of the usual taqueria suspects-burrito, taco, combo platters with slightly more variety.

There are also three different stylings of veg burrito/tacos including vegan and grilled veg options, which is nice to see. The breakfast menu is especially strong, and they have an awesome salsa/condiment bar.  Pricing for these items is fairly standard for the area about three bucks a taco and everything else pretty much starts at 7 bucks. Typically a meal will run about ten dollars with a drink and add ons, but it's possible to go the bare bones bargain route for slightly less.

616,I have frequently passed by this place but never gave it any thought to stop by but with the recommendation we decided to stop in for lunch I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and good this place actually was Food: grilled chicken tacos & steak (good) blk beans & rice everything was fresh the food was heavy which I liked and I like the way the meat  was cut into small pieces because I definitely dislike big chunks of meat with a lot of fat Service: fastAmbience: gives u a little feel of a little taqueria in Mexico Conclusion: better than I thought I will definitely return I love their chicken tacos and their rice and beans everything was fresh very tasty very good light and healthy I would say give this place a try
617,"Taco Trek Lesson 3, THE TORTILLA. The CORN tortilla is the double-layered  backbone of the taco experience, setting the tone for moisture and texture throughout the bite. The flavor of the corn is the floor upon which the flavors of the meat, fat, and toppings dance the Salsa! When talk-talking tacos, there are two types of corn tortillas to consider: fresh-made and factory-made.* Fresh tortillas are rare. If you're lucky enough to find tortillas rolled out ON-THE-SPOT from a press, quality is a WRAP! Fresh corn tortillas are always perfectly moist and tender, and need minimal added fat. The experience is like eating supple wontons or dumplings; the fresh tortilla is as pliable as soft cloth, and the corn never wads up into dry unpleasantness in the back of your mouth. Fresh tortillas, however, have zero shelf-life, and thus we get to...* Factory tortillas, which are common. Tortillas made in a factory have added preservatives and binding agents that make them dense, dry, and disgusting -- but they can be made awesome again through the absorption of enough fat on a hot griddle! Simply steaming factory tortillas is UNACCEPTABLE to a tacossieur like me, because they get doughy and taste acidic. Automatic Taco Fail!* Pro-tip: You can tell the QUALITY of a corn tortilla just from a TACO PHOTO. :::: Positively Awesome: 1) Round corners at the folds, 2) Oil-stained, deep color, 3) some shine on the surface -- tender and moist, let's rejoice! 4) Greased spots of golden-brown -- crisped on the griddle to be chewy in the middle!:::: God-Awful: 1) Sharp corners at the folded edges -- MEH, mostly dry. 2) Light-colored, dry-looking surface -- cotton-mouth! Keep away! 3) Wet, doughy-looking surface (sure sign of gringo tacos) -- acidic YUCKTOWN._______ Strictly a review of La Mission's TACOS _______Tacos were sadly MEH-diocre. I suspect the overall 4-star review was was given by burrito-eaters that are HIGHLY FORGIVING of crappy meats. Time to take a BART ride to the Fruitvale for some real-deal taco trucks, my Gringos. Check out my TACO TREK LIST to get you started.3   M I N U S E S- FAILS de CARNESRemember, tacos are all about delivering delicious MEAT-DECADENCE into your mouth. No hiding the flavor of the meat with cheese, lettuce, beans, rice, guac, cream, etc. Pureza means PURITY!:::: Borrego -- MEH-EH-EH-EH. Lamb Barbacoa was gamy and dry. The marinade was decent, but not enough to rescue the meat. I had one bite of LAMB FAT that was great, though.:::: Al Pastor -- MEH'VERAGE. All around dry, barely tasted any pork fat. The shallow marinade tasted like mild Tapatio.:::: Carnitas -- GAR'MEHGE. Chipotle-vels of CarMEHtas failure. Didn't even taste like pork. More of a dry, cotton-mouthed protein filler. Awful.- BORED-TILLAS:::: Tortillas -- NEED LOTION. Dry, and in need of moisturizing from some oil. After 4 minutes, these unlotioned tortillas absorbed too much moisture, thus becoming doughy in places, and pretty gross. Folks who prefer flour tortillas to corn tortillas do so because of tortillas LIKE THESE.- GRINGOFIED MENUMeat quality is automatically suspect if certain authentic and standard carnes aren't on the menu: no cabeza, no lengua, no tripe... This probably means that the clientele is inexperienced, and thus these delicacies will go unordered. This probably also means that the meats that are on the menu aren't going to be that awesome because the aforementioned inexperienced clientele will not demand quality.2   S T A R S* STEAK'ED THEIR CLAIM:::: Carne Asada Taco -- PURDY GOOD.

Thank you so much guys!*(1/2) LOVELY OUTDOOR SPACEBring your beer to the pretty lil outdoor space with a trellis for shade, and enough tables to seat about 20."
618,"I understand from friends that the meat options are tasty, but the veggie and fish burritos and tacos I've had here were poor.The staff are always friendly, and you get nice thick chips, but nothing else has been good the three times I've visited."
619,I am no Mexican food expert but I thought their burrito was solid. I had a plain old vegetarian burrito without any extras like sour cream or guacamole and I also didn't get cheese. They give you a choice of black beans or refried. I super love their salsa offerings. The tomatillo salsa and the other one (I can't remember which) are both delicious and I totally drowned every bite of my burrito with both.The burrito itself was huge but was the perfect thing after I was famished from climbing. Definitely better than Monte Cristo up the street!
620,"TL;DR 5/5 carnitas tacosCame here during dinner time, line was not too bad. I ordered 3 tacos, carnitas, carne asada, and another something taco. The sauce, cilantro, onion, everything was the perfect taste and ratio. My favorite was the carnitas, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. They have a wide variety of items on their menu, and I will definitely be back to try the rest!This is my friend's top taco place in Berkeley, and I would also put this at the top of my list.La Mission is accessible via AC Transit 51B or car (small parking lot in the back)."
621,How come my simple to-go order can't be prepared correctly? Is asking for pico de gallo too complicated? I'm tired of getting home to find out that my food was made incorrectly. I try to keep any additions simple. I think I forgot why I like La Mission. I'm finished hoping you'll get my order right.
622,"we got off our night shift and went here for breakfast. There was no wait time at all, the restaurant just opened for the day. we were first customers. restaurant was very clean. There was a breakfast menu and we could order from full menu. we also ordered pitcher of sangria - which was  great.4 star for food. felt like food was cooked quick, slightly undercooked. 5 star for service. Will def stop by here for more food"
623,"I so wanted breakfast, My meeting ran late so I had to settle for the tacos. The grilled fish taco was good. The Tacos al pastor were ok. Not great although not bad. Tortillas are small although they make up for the amount of meat they put on. Salsa did not have much flavor. The staff was friendly and I will be back for the breakfast."
624,"Best spot in Berkeley for Mexican food.  My favorite is the baja fish taco, $5.50.  I thought it was expensive for one taco but it is huge!  They give a generous serving of fish, crema, cabbage, and tomatoes.  I love the breading of the fish, giving a nice crispy texture with moist fish inside, and the crema makes for a great flavor combo.  Delish!The horchata is really sweet, but becomes perfect when the ice melts.  This place has got friendly staff, a great vibe, is clean, has outside garden seating, and also boasts a parking lot in the back to top it off (no Berkeley street parking necessary)."
625,"Service was efficient and friendly, but La Mission's chicken dishes leave everything to be desired. If you eat pork, they have your back (the pozole for example), but the chicken is literally tiny dry cubes of meat with no flavor. I spent 17$ and change on two street tacos a small salad and one beer. Seemed outrageously high relative to the quality and amount of food. Maybe the other tacos are just so much more delicious? If I were them I would pull all the cubed chicken off the menu. The green salad was good, though sparse. I liked that it had pepitas, cabbage shreds and a vinaigrette dressing. Not sure I would come back just for that though with so many other amazing Mexican places around the area. Sad because I really wanted to love this place!"
626,"This is by far my favorite taco place in the bay area!The grand tacos here has 2 shells (1 soft 1 hard) and has more fillings than normal tacos. I normally go for the beef and the fish taco while my husband will have these 2 and a pork one as well. The fish is always crispy outside and tender inside, with a light dressing to compliment the flavor. The beef taco doesn't skim on the beef quantity like a lot other places. We also like the nachos here. In fact it is the favorite dish for my mother who comes from China. The service is slightly slow here but that's because they make everything fresh. It's a wait I'm willing to have for good quality food。"
627,Best Mexican food in Berkeley. Really really fresh meats and diverse vegetarian choices. Excellent moles and savory menudo. Perfect snacking for a summer afternoon.
628,"Mission Accomplished. Decent Mexican food found in Berkeley!Food: Have your pick from tacos to burritos, soups, entree plates, aguas frescas and even some fresh desserts if you're sweet tooth kicks in. I went with a simple and classic cheesy quesadilla, but added prawns to fancy it up a bit. Oozing with cheesy, grilled to near perfection and boasting with fresh flavors of chopped prawns; it was truly delicious. My friend ordered the Al Pastor Burrito which was packed with some of the best marinated and juicy chunks of meat we've ever had, he ordered it with everything, both of us were surprised the burrito didn't fall apart upon first bite. It was the perfect blend of fresh and savory ingredients all enclosed in a grilled and slightly charred flour tortilla. The salsa was the only issue as it wasn't nearly as spicy nor fresh as I hoped for. Chips are not free, that was a bummer as well. Other than that, the food was solid.Price: A bit steeper than your average casual Mexican eatery, but worth the price. Ambiance: Cozy and small interior, very tight and minimal seating, but they do have a huge outdoor patio equipped with tons of natural shading from the big trees. Parking lot is behind the building.Service: The young man that took our order greeted us with a genuine smile and was very patient. Same story with the young man that brought us our food.Overall: I was getting a bit tired of driving to Oakland for Mexican food, so I'm glad I finally found fresh and decent tasting Mexican food in Berkeley. Prices are a bit steeper than I'd like, but well worth the solid tasting food and wonderful service."
629,"I've come here several times and have had great experiences each time. Be it afternoon, evening, or night, this place has fantastic service and wonderful food.Tonight hubs and I had a beer each while waiting for our order (Santa Fe salad and chile rellenos). The total came to $36 and I tipped up to $42. Seating inside is 8 small-ish tables that seat 2/3 each (booth on the back). There is more seating outside.Even when lines get long, the food comes out fast and hot. The staff are extremely friendly. There's Tapatio and tobasco and other bottles hot sauces available if you dine in."
630,Came here after a wedding and the guys that work here followed us out to our car and took pictures of our license plate as we were trying to leave. They were accusing us of knowing somebody else who they thought hit their truck. Not only will we not be back but we will be following up with this issue as this was completely uncalled for. One of the workers wanted to fight us. That's not how you run a business.
631,"This place has great food. The menu is huge, and reasonably priced. Their breakfast burritos are on point! The food is mixed traditional, authentic Mexican food as well as MexicanAmerican food (burritos, nachos).Everybody here is pretty friendly,  and I think just about everything they make is made from scratch. While you can get your food to go, this is not a ""fast-food"" restaurant, really. It could be fun to sit down there also, there's lots of tables inside and outside. A majority of the food is fresh and made to order and comes out piping-hot off the grill. Don't confuse this with some local Berkeley Taco Bell. Mission is legit, awesome, awesome food."
632,"Hands down the best Mexican food in Berkeley. The mole poblano burrito, either with chicken or carnitas is excellent, and the platanos and beans are awesome. But let me reiterate- do not miss out on the amazing mole here!!!Casual atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating, in a quiet area of Berkeley far from the university. Food is delivered to your table quickly, service is nothing outstanding, but good enough.Food is priced well for how much food you get- I paid a bit over $10 for a burrito that's probably going to keep me full for two days lolol"
633,"We had a good experience at La Mission this afternoon. We ordered tacos de papa, cocktail, and tacos de Barbacoa. Tacos were delicious, cocktail filling, lots of shrimp. Juice and sangria were so so. But overall good experience. Fresh breeze, out door  seating and friendly staff!"

Awful.- BORED-TILLAS:::: Tortillas -- NEED LOTION. Dry, and in need of moisturizing from some oil.

658,"I understand from friends that the meat options are tasty, but the veggie and fish burritos and tacos I've had here were poor.The staff are always friendly, and you get nice thick chips, but nothing else has been good the three times I've visited."
659,I am no Mexican food expert but I thought their burrito was solid. I had a plain old vegetarian burrito without any extras like sour cream or guacamole and I also didn't get cheese. They give you a choice of black beans or refried. I super love their salsa offerings. The tomatillo salsa and the other one (I can't remember which) are both delicious and I totally drowned every bite of my burrito with both.The burrito itself was huge but was the perfect thing after I was famished from climbing. Definitely better than Monte Cristo up the street!
660,"TL;DR 5/5 carnitas tacosCame here during dinner time, line was not too bad. I ordered 3 tacos, carnitas, carne asada, and another something taco. The sauce, cilantro, onion, everything was the perfect taste and ratio. My favorite was the carnitas, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. They have a wide variety of items on their menu, and I will definitely be back to try the rest!This is my friend's top taco place in Berkeley, and I would also put this at the top of my list.La Mission is accessible via AC Transit 51B or car (small parking lot in the back)."
661,How come my simple to-go order can't be prepared correctly? Is asking for pico de gallo too complicated? I'm tired of getting home to find out that my food was made incorrectly. I try to keep any additions simple. I think I forgot why I like La Mission. I'm finished hoping you'll get my order right.
662,"we got off our night shift and went here for breakfast. There was no wait time at all, the restaurant just opened for the day. we were first customers. restaurant was very clean. There was a breakfast menu and we could order from full menu. we also ordered pitcher of sangria - which was  great.4 star for food. felt like food was cooked quick, slightly undercooked. 5 star for service. Will def stop by here for more food"
663,"I so wanted breakfast, My meeting ran late so I had to settle for the tacos. The grilled fish taco was good. The Tacos al pastor were ok. Not great although not bad. Tortillas are small although they make up for the amount of meat they put on. Salsa did not have much flavor. The staff was friendly and I will be back for the breakfast."
664,"Best spot in Berkeley for Mexican food.  My favorite is the baja fish taco, $5.50.  I thought it was expensive for one taco but it is huge!  They give a generous serving of fish, crema, cabbage, and tomatoes.  I love the breading of the fish, giving a nice crispy texture with moist fish inside, and the crema makes for a great flavor combo.  Delish!The horchata is really sweet, but becomes perfect when the ice melts.  This place has got friendly staff, a great vibe, is clean, has outside garden seating, and also boasts a parking lot in the back to top it off (no Berkeley street parking necessary)."
665,"Service was efficient and friendly, but La Mission's chicken dishes leave everything to be desired. If you eat pork, they have your back (the pozole for example), but the chicken is literally tiny dry cubes of meat with no flavor. I spent 17$ and change on two street tacos a small salad and one beer. Seemed outrageously high relative to the quality and amount of food. Maybe the other tacos are just so much more delicious? If I were them I would pull all the cubed chicken off the menu. The green salad was good, though sparse. I liked that it had pepitas, cabbage shreds and a vinaigrette dressing. Not sure I would come back just for that though with so many other amazing Mexican places around the area. Sad because I really wanted to love this place!"
666,"This is by far my favorite taco place in the bay area!The grand tacos here has 2 shells (1 soft 1 hard) and has more fillings than normal tacos. I normally go for the beef and the fish taco while my husband will have these 2 and a pork one as well. The fish is always crispy outside and tender inside, with a light dressing to compliment the flavor. The beef taco doesn't skim on the beef quantity like a lot other places. We also like the nachos here. In fact it is the favorite dish for my mother who comes from China. The service is slightly slow here but that's because they make everything fresh. It's a wait I'm willing to have for good quality food。"
667,Best Mexican food in Berkeley. Really really fresh meats and diverse vegetarian choices. Excellent moles and savory menudo. Perfect snacking for a summer afternoon.
668,"Mission Accomplished. Decent Mexican food found in Berkeley!Food: Have your pick from tacos to burritos, soups, entree plates, aguas frescas and even some fresh desserts if you're sweet tooth kicks in. I went with a simple and classic cheesy quesadilla, but added prawns to fancy it up a bit. Oozing with cheesy, grilled to near perfection and boasting with fresh flavors of chopped prawns; it was truly delicious. My friend ordered the Al Pastor Burrito which was packed with some of the best marinated and juicy chunks of meat we've ever had, he ordered it with everything, both of us were surprised the burrito didn't fall apart upon first bite. It was the perfect blend of fresh and savory ingredients all enclosed in a grilled and slightly charred flour tortilla. The salsa was the only issue as it wasn't nearly as spicy nor fresh as I hoped for. Chips are not free, that was a bummer as well. Other than that, the food was solid.Price: A bit steeper than your average casual Mexican eatery, but worth the price. Ambiance: Cozy and small interior, very tight and minimal seating, but they do have a huge outdoor patio equipped with tons of natural shading from the big trees. Parking lot is behind the building.Service: The young man that took our order greeted us with a genuine smile and was very patient. Same story with the young man that brought us our food.Overall: I was getting a bit tired of driving to Oakland for Mexican food, so I'm glad I finally found fresh and decent tasting Mexican food in Berkeley. Prices are a bit steeper than I'd like, but well worth the solid tasting food and wonderful service."
669,"I've come here several times and have had great experiences each time. Be it afternoon, evening, or night, this place has fantastic service and wonderful food.Tonight hubs and I had a beer each while waiting for our order (Santa Fe salad and chile rellenos). The total came to $36 and I tipped up to $42. Seating inside is 8 small-ish tables that seat 2/3 each (booth on the back). There is more seating outside.Even when lines get long, the food comes out fast and hot. The staff are extremely friendly. There's Tapatio and tobasco and other bottles hot sauces available if you dine in."
670,Came here after a wedding and the guys that work here followed us out to our car and took pictures of our license plate as we were trying to leave. They were accusing us of knowing somebody else who they thought hit their truck. Not only will we not be back but we will be following up with this issue as this was completely uncalled for. One of the workers wanted to fight us. That's not how you run a business.
671,"This place has great food. The menu is huge, and reasonably priced. Their breakfast burritos are on point! The food is mixed traditional, authentic Mexican food as well as MexicanAmerican food (burritos, nachos).Everybody here is pretty friendly,  and I think just about everything they make is made from scratch. While you can get your food to go, this is not a ""fast-food"" restaurant, really. It could be fun to sit down there also, there's lots of tables inside and outside. A majority of the food is fresh and made to order and comes out piping-hot off the grill. Don't confuse this with some local Berkeley Taco Bell. Mission is legit, awesome, awesome food."
672,"Hands down the best Mexican food in Berkeley. The mole poblano burrito, either with chicken or carnitas is excellent, and the platanos and beans are awesome. But let me reiterate- do not miss out on the amazing mole here!!!Casual atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating, in a quiet area of Berkeley far from the university. Food is delivered to your table quickly, service is nothing outstanding, but good enough.Food is priced well for how much food you get- I paid a bit over $10 for a burrito that's probably going to keep me full for two days lolol"
673,"We had a good experience at La Mission this afternoon. We ordered tacos de papa, cocktail, and tacos de Barbacoa. Tacos were delicious, cocktail filling, lots of shrimp. Juice and sangria were so so. But overall good experience. Fresh breeze, out door  seating and friendly staff!"
674,"Super awesome taqueria right on the main drag of university avenue.They have their own small parking lot behind the building accessible via chestnut st. in addition to the usual street parking. Usually there's a spot or two available at any given time, although the super popular lunch rush can be very busy.There is pleasing inside and outside seating. The outside seating is larger then most places of this type, and is particularly nice on a sunny day, what with the natural shade provided by several friendly trees.

The menu consists of the usual taqueria suspects-burrito, taco, combo platters with slightly more variety. They offer the full range of meats including barbacoa, lengua, camarón (shrimp) and several different varieties of fish. There are also three different stylings of veg burrito/tacos including vegan and grilled veg options, which is nice to see. The breakfast menu is especially strong, and they have an awesome salsa/condiment bar.  Pricing for these items is fairly standard for the area about three bucks a taco and everything else pretty much starts at 7 bucks. Typically a meal will run about ten dollars with a drink and add ons, but it's possible to go the bare bones bargain route for slightly less. It's the flavor, convenience, and quality of the food that really shines here.One of the better lunch/breakfast options for the area for sure."
675,"Solid, good, authentic mexican food.   Whether you want tacos, enchiladas, tortas, burritos, pozole, etc., this place does not disappoint.Highly recommend for the price and the service.  There is also a parking lot and great outdoor seating."
676,I have frequently passed by this place but never gave it any thought to stop by but with the recommendation we decided to stop in for lunch I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and good this place actually was Food: grilled chicken tacos & steak (good) blk beans & rice everything was fresh the food was heavy which I liked and I like the way the meat  was cut into small pieces because I definitely dislike big chunks of meat with a lot of fat Service: fastAmbience: gives u a little feel of a little taqueria in Mexico Conclusion: better than I thought I will definitely return I love their chicken tacos and their rice and beans everything was fresh very tasty very good light and healthy I would say give this place a try

698,"I understand from friends that the meat options are tasty, but the veggie and fish burritos and tacos I've had here were poor.The staff are always friendly, and you get nice thick chips, but nothing else has been good the three times I've visited."
699,I am no Mexican food expert but I thought their burrito was solid. I had a plain old vegetarian burrito without any extras like sour cream or guacamole and I also didn't get cheese. They give you a choice of black beans or refried. I super love their salsa offerings. The tomatillo salsa and the other one (I can't remember which) are both delicious and I totally drowned every bite of my burrito with both.The burrito itself was huge but was the perfect thing after I was famished from climbing. Definitely better than Monte Cristo up the street!
700,"TL;DR 5/5 carnitas tacosCame here during dinner time, line was not too bad. I ordered 3 tacos, carnitas, carne asada, and another something taco. The sauce, cilantro, onion, everything was the perfect taste and ratio. My favorite was the carnitas, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. They have a wide variety of items on their menu, and I will definitely be back to try the rest!This is my friend's top taco place in Berkeley, and I would also put this at the top of my list.La Mission is accessible via AC Transit 51B or car (small parking lot in the back)."
701,How come my simple to-go order can't be prepared correctly? Is asking for pico de gallo too complicated? I'm tired of getting home to find out that my food was made incorrectly. I try to keep any additions simple. I think I forgot why I like La Mission. I'm finished hoping you'll get my order right.
702,"we got off our night shift and went here for breakfast. There was no wait time at all, the restaurant just opened for the day. we were first customers. restaurant was very clean. There was a breakfast menu and we could order from full menu. we also ordered pitcher of sangria - which was  great.4 star for food. felt like food was cooked quick, slightly undercooked. 5 star for service. Will def stop by here for more food"
703,"I so wanted breakfast, My meeting ran late so I had to settle for the tacos. The grilled fish taco was good. The Tacos al pastor were ok. Not great although not bad. Tortillas are small although they make up for the amount of meat they put on. Salsa did not have much flavor. The staff was friendly and I will be back for the breakfast."
704,"Best spot in Berkeley for Mexican food.  My favorite is the baja fish taco, $5.50.  I thought it was expensive for one taco but it is huge!  They give a generous serving of fish, crema, cabbage, and tomatoes.  I love the breading of the fish, giving a nice crispy texture with moist fish inside, and the crema makes for a great flavor combo.  Delish!The horchata is really sweet, but becomes perfect when the ice melts.  This place has got friendly staff, a great vibe, is clean, has outside garden seating, and also boasts a parking lot in the back to top it off (no Berkeley street parking necessary)."
705,"Service was efficient and friendly, but La Mission's chicken dishes leave everything to be desired. If you eat pork, they have your back (the pozole for example), but the chicken is literally tiny dry cubes of meat with no flavor. I spent 17$ and change on two street tacos a small salad and one beer. Seemed outrageously high relative to the quality and amount of food. Maybe the other tacos are just so much more delicious? If I were them I would pull all the cubed chicken off the menu. The green salad was good, though sparse. I liked that it had pepitas, cabbage shreds and a vinaigrette dressing. Not sure I would come back just for that though with so many other amazing Mexican places around the area. Sad because I really wanted to love this place!"
706,"This is by far my favorite taco place in the bay area!The grand tacos here has 2 shells (1 soft 1 hard) and has more fillings than normal tacos. I normally go for the beef and the fish taco while my husband will have these 2 and a pork one as well. The fish is always crispy outside and tender inside, with a light dressing to compliment the flavor. The beef taco doesn't skim on the beef quantity like a lot other places. We also like the nachos here. In fact it is the favorite dish for my mother who comes from China. The service is slightly slow here but that's because they make everything fresh. It's a wait I'm willing to have for good quality food。"
707,Best Mexican food in Berkeley. Really really fresh meats and diverse vegetarian choices. Excellent moles and savory menudo. Perfect snacking for a summer afternoon.
708,"Mission Accomplished. Decent Mexican food found in Berkeley!Food: Have your pick from tacos to burritos, soups, entree plates, aguas frescas and even some fresh desserts if you're sweet tooth kicks in. I went with a simple and classic cheesy quesadilla, but added prawns to fancy it up a bit. Oozing with cheesy, grilled to near perfection and boasting with fresh flavors of chopped prawns; it was truly delicious. My friend ordered the Al Pastor Burrito which was packed with some of the best marinated and juicy chunks of meat we've ever had, he ordered it with everything, both of us were surprised the burrito didn't fall apart upon first bite. It was the perfect blend of fresh and savory ingredients all enclosed in a grilled and slightly charred flour tortilla. The salsa was the only issue as it wasn't nearly as spicy nor fresh as I hoped for. Chips are not free, that was a bummer as well. Other than that, the food was solid.Price: A bit steeper than your average casual Mexican eatery, but worth the price. Ambiance: Cozy and small interior, very tight and minimal seating, but they do have a huge outdoor patio equipped with tons of natural shading from the big trees. Parking lot is behind the building.Service: The young man that took our order greeted us with a genuine smile and was very patient. Same story with the young man that brought us our food.Overall: I was getting a bit tired of driving to Oakland for Mexican food, so I'm glad I finally found fresh and decent tasting Mexican food in Berkeley. Prices are a bit steeper than I'd like, but well worth the solid tasting food and wonderful service."
709,"I've come here several times and have had great experiences each time. Be it afternoon, evening, or night, this place has fantastic service and wonderful food.Tonight hubs and I had a beer each while waiting for our order (Santa Fe salad and chile rellenos). The total came to $36 and I tipped up to $42. Seating inside is 8 small-ish tables that seat 2/3 each (booth on the back). There is more seating outside.Even when lines get long, the food comes out fast and hot. The staff are extremely friendly. There's Tapatio and tobasco and other bottles hot sauces available if you dine in."
710,Came here after a wedding and the guys that work here followed us out to our car and took pictures of our license plate as we were trying to leave. They were accusing us of knowing somebody else who they thought hit their truck. Not only will we not be back but we will be following up with this issue as this was completely uncalled for. One of the workers wanted to fight us. That's not how you run a business.
711,"This place has great food. The menu is huge, and reasonably priced. Their breakfast burritos are on point! The food is mixed traditional, authentic Mexican food as well as MexicanAmerican food (burritos, nachos).Everybody here is pretty friendly,  and I think just about everything they make is made from scratch. While you can get your food to go, this is not a ""fast-food"" restaurant, really. It could be fun to sit down there also, there's lots of tables inside and outside. A majority of the food is fresh and made to order and comes out piping-hot off the grill. Don't confuse this with some local Berkeley Taco Bell. Mission is legit, awesome, awesome food."
712,"Hands down the best Mexican food in Berkeley. The mole poblano burrito, either with chicken or carnitas is excellent, and the platanos and beans are awesome. But let me reiterate- do not miss out on the amazing mole here!!!Casual atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating, in a quiet area of Berkeley far from the university. Food is delivered to your table quickly, service is nothing outstanding, but good enough.Food is priced well for how much food you get- I paid a bit over $10 for a burrito that's probably going to keep me full for two days lolol"
713,"We had a good experience at La Mission this afternoon. We ordered tacos de papa, cocktail, and tacos de Barbacoa. Tacos were delicious, cocktail filling, lots of shrimp. Juice and sangria were so so. But overall good experience. Fresh breeze, out door  seating and friendly staff!"
714,"Super awesome taqueria right on the main drag of university avenue.They have their own small parking lot behind the building accessible via chestnut st. in addition to the usual street parking. Usually there's a spot or two available at any given time, although the super popular lunch rush can be very busy.There is pleasing inside and outside seating. The outside seating is larger then most places of this type, and is particularly nice on a sunny day, what with the natural shade provided by several friendly trees. Inside seating is the usual booth/chair combos al fast food restaurant style.  the look of the place scream re-purposed fast food chain to me, but the owners have made it all their own local styling, even if the inside is dominated by the order counter.Service  is of the order and pick up when called model. The menu consists of the usual taqueria suspects-burrito, taco, combo platters with slightly more variety. They offer the full range of meats including barbacoa, lengua, camarón (shrimp) and several different varieties of fish. There are also three different stylings of veg burrito/tacos including vegan and grilled veg options, which is nice to see. The breakfast menu is especially strong, and they have an awesome salsa/condiment bar.  Pricing for these items is fairly standard for the area about three bucks a taco and everything else pretty much starts at 7 bucks. Typically a meal will run about ten dollars with a drink and add ons, but it's possible to go the bare bones bargain route for slightly less. It's the flavor, convenience, and quality of the food that really shines here.One of the better lunch/breakfast options for the area for sure."
715,"Solid, good, authentic mexican food.   Whether you want tacos, enchiladas, tortas, burritos, pozole, etc., this place does not disappoint.Highly recommend for the price and the service.  There is also a parking lot and great outdoor seating."
716,I have frequently passed by this place but never gave it any thought to stop by but with the recommendation we decided to stop in for lunch I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and good this place actually was Food: grilled chicken tacos & steak (good) blk beans & rice everything was fresh the food was heavy which I liked and I like the way the meat  was cut into small pieces because I definitely dislike big chunks of meat with a lot of fat Service: fastAmbience: gives u a little feel of a little taqueria in Mexico Conclusion: better than I thought I will definitely return I love their chicken tacos and their rice and beans everything was fresh very tasty very good light and healthy I would say give this place a try

Tortillas are small although they make up for the amount of meat they put on. Salsa did not have much flavor. The staff was friendly and I will be back for the breakfast."
744,"Best spot in Berkeley for Mexican food.  My favorite is the baja fish taco, $5.50.  I thought it was expensive for one taco but it is huge!  They give a generous serving of fish, crema, cabbage, and tomatoes.  I love the breading of the fish, giving a nice crispy texture with moist fish inside, and the crema makes for a great flavor combo.  Delish!The horchata is really sweet, but becomes perfect when the ice melts.  This place has got friendly staff, a great vibe, is clean, has outside garden seating, and also boasts a parking lot in the back to top it off (no Berkeley street parking necessary)."
745,"Service was efficient and friendly, but La Mission's chicken dishes leave everything to be desired. If you eat pork, they have your back (the pozole for example), but the chicken is literally tiny dry cubes of meat with no flavor. I spent 17$ and change on two street tacos a small salad and one beer. Seemed outrageously high relative to the quality and amount of food. Maybe the other tacos are just so much more delicious? If I were them I would pull all the cubed chicken off the menu. The green salad was good, though sparse. I liked that it had pepitas, cabbage shreds and a vinaigrette dressing. Not sure I would come back just for that though with so many other amazing Mexican places around the area. Sad because I really wanted to love this place!"
746,"This is by far my favorite taco place in the bay area!The grand tacos here has 2 shells (1 soft 1 hard) and has more fillings than normal tacos. I normally go for the beef and the fish taco while my husband will have these 2 and a pork one as well. The fish is always crispy outside and tender inside, with a light dressing to compliment the flavor. The beef taco doesn't skim on the beef quantity like a lot other places. We also like the nachos here. In fact it is the favorite dish for my mother who comes from China. The service is slightly slow here but that's because they make everything fresh. It's a wait I'm willing to have for good quality food。"
747,Best Mexican food in Berkeley. Really really fresh meats and diverse vegetarian choices. Excellent moles and savory menudo. Perfect snacking for a summer afternoon.
748,"Mission Accomplished. Decent Mexican food found in Berkeley!Food: Have your pick from tacos to burritos, soups, entree plates, aguas frescas and even some fresh desserts if you're sweet tooth kicks in. I went with a simple and classic cheesy quesadilla, but added prawns to fancy it up a bit. Oozing with cheesy, grilled to near perfection and boasting with fresh flavors of chopped prawns; it was truly delicious. My friend ordered the Al Pastor Burrito which was packed with some of the best marinated and juicy chunks of meat we've ever had, he ordered it with everything, both of us were surprised the burrito didn't fall apart upon first bite. It was the perfect blend of fresh and savory ingredients all enclosed in a grilled and slightly charred flour tortilla. The salsa was the only issue as it wasn't nearly as spicy nor fresh as I hoped for. Chips are not free, that was a bummer as well. Other than that, the food was solid.Price: A bit steeper than your average casual Mexican eatery, but worth the price. Ambiance: Cozy and small interior, very tight and minimal seating, but they do have a huge outdoor patio equipped with tons of natural shading from the big trees. Parking lot is behind the building.Service: The young man that took our order greeted us with a genuine smile and was very patient. Same story with the young man that brought us our food.Overall: I was getting a bit tired of driving to Oakland for Mexican food, so I'm glad I finally found fresh and decent tasting Mexican food in Berkeley. Prices are a bit steeper than I'd like, but well worth the solid tasting food and wonderful service."
749,"I've come here several times and have had great experiences each time. Be it afternoon, evening, or night, this place has fantastic service and wonderful food.Tonight hubs and I had a beer each while waiting for our order (Santa Fe salad and chile rellenos). The total came to $36 and I tipped up to $42. Seating inside is 8 small-ish tables that seat 2/3 each (booth on the back). There is more seating outside.Even when lines get long, the food comes out fast and hot. The staff are extremely friendly. There's Tapatio and tobasco and other bottles hot sauces available if you dine in."
750,Came here after a wedding and the guys that work here followed us out to our car and took pictures of our license plate as we were trying to leave. They were accusing us of knowing somebody else who they thought hit their truck. Not only will we not be back but we will be following up with this issue as this was completely uncalled for. One of the workers wanted to fight us. That's not how you run a business.
751,"This place has great food. The menu is huge, and reasonably priced. Their breakfast burritos are on point! The food is mixed traditional, authentic Mexican food as well as MexicanAmerican food (burritos, nachos).Everybody here is pretty friendly,  and I think just about everything they make is made from scratch. While you can get your food to go, this is not a ""fast-food"" restaurant, really. It could be fun to sit down there also, there's lots of tables inside and outside. A majority of the food is fresh and made to order and comes out piping-hot off the grill. Don't confuse this with some local Berkeley Taco Bell. Mission is legit, awesome, awesome food."
752,"Hands down the best Mexican food in Berkeley. The mole poblano burrito, either with chicken or carnitas is excellent, and the platanos and beans are awesome. But let me reiterate- do not miss out on the amazing mole here!!!Casual atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating, in a quiet area of Berkeley far from the university. Food is delivered to your table quickly, service is nothing outstanding, but good enough.Food is priced well for how much food you get- I paid a bit over $10 for a burrito that's probably going to keep me full for two days lolol"
753,"We had a good experience at La Mission this afternoon. We ordered tacos de papa, cocktail, and tacos de Barbacoa. Tacos were delicious, cocktail filling, lots of shrimp. Juice and sangria were so so. But overall good experience. Fresh breeze, out door  seating and friendly staff!"
754,"Super awesome taqueria right on the main drag of university avenue.They have their own small parking lot behind the building accessible via chestnut st. in addition to the usual street parking. Usually there's a spot or two available at any given time, although the super popular lunch rush can be very busy.There is pleasing inside and outside seating. The outside seating is larger then most places of this type, and is particularly nice on a sunny day, what with the natural shade provided by several friendly trees. Inside seating is the usual booth/chair combos al fast food restaurant style.  the look of the place scream re-purposed fast food chain to me, but the owners have made it all their own local styling, even if the inside is dominated by the order counter.Service  is of the order and pick up when called model. The menu consists of the usual taqueria suspects-burrito, taco, combo platters with slightly more variety. They offer the full range of meats including barbacoa, lengua, camarón (shrimp) and several different varieties of fish. There are also three different stylings of veg burrito/tacos including vegan and grilled veg options, which is nice to see. The breakfast menu is especially strong, and they have an awesome salsa/condiment bar.  Pricing for these items is fairly standard for the area about three bucks a taco and everything else pretty much starts at 7 bucks. Typically a meal will run about ten dollars with a drink and add ons, but it's possible to go the bare bones bargain route for slightly less. It's the flavor, convenience, and quality of the food that really shines here.One of the better lunch/breakfast options for the area for sure."
755,"Solid, good, authentic mexican food.   Whether you want tacos, enchiladas, tortas, burritos, pozole, etc., this place does not disappoint.Highly recommend for the price and the service.  There is also a parking lot and great outdoor seating."
756,I have frequently passed by this place but never gave it any thought to stop by but with the recommendation we decided to stop in for lunch I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and good this place actually was Food: grilled chicken tacos & steak (good) blk beans & rice everything was fresh the food was heavy which I liked and I like the way the meat  was cut into small pieces because I definitely dislike big chunks of meat with a lot of fat Service: fastAmbience: gives u a little feel of a little taqueria in Mexico Conclusion: better than I thought I will definitely return I love their chicken tacos and their rice and beans everything was fresh very tasty very good light and healthy I would say give this place a try
757,"Taco Trek Lesson 3, THE TORTILLA. The CORN tortilla is the double-layered  backbone of the taco experience, setting the tone for moisture and texture throughout the bite. The flavor of the corn is the floor upon which the flavors of the meat, fat, and toppings dance the Salsa! When talk-talking tacos, there are two types of corn tortillas to consider: fresh-made and factory-made.* Fresh tortillas are rare. If you're lucky enough to find tortillas rolled out ON-THE-SPOT from a press, quality is a WRAP! Fresh corn tortillas are always perfectly moist and tender, and need minimal added fat. The experience is like eating supple wontons or dumplings; the fresh tortilla is as pliable as soft cloth, and the corn never wads up into dry unpleasantness in the back of your mouth. Fresh tortillas, however, have zero shelf-life, and thus we get to...* Factory tortillas, which are common. Tortillas made in a factory have added preservatives and binding agents that make them dense, dry, and disgusting -- but they can be made awesome again through the absorption of enough fat on a hot griddle! Simply steaming factory tortillas is UNACCEPTABLE to a tacossieur like me, because they get doughy and taste acidic. Automatic Taco Fail!* Pro-tip: You can tell the QUALITY of a corn tortilla just from a TACO PHOTO. :::: Positively Awesome: 1) Round corners at the folds, 2) Oil-stained, deep color, 3) some shine on the surface -- tender and moist, let's rejoice! 4) Greased spots of golden-brown -- crisped on the griddle to be chewy in the middle!:::: God-Awful: 1) Sharp corners at the folded edges -- MEH, mostly dry. 2) Light-colored, dry-looking surface -- cotton-mouth! Keep away! 3) Wet, doughy-looking surface (sure sign of gringo tacos) -- acidic YUCKTOWN._______ Strictly a review of La Mission's TACOS _______Tacos were sadly MEH-diocre. I suspect the overall 4-star review was was given by burrito-eaters that are HIGHLY FORGIVING of crappy meats. Time to take a BART ride to the Fruitvale for some real-deal taco trucks, my Gringos. Check out my TACO TREK LIST to get you started.3   M I N U S E S- FAILS de CARNESRemember, tacos are all about delivering delicious MEAT-DECADENCE into your mouth. No hiding the flavor of the meat with cheese, lettuce, beans, rice, guac, cream, etc. Pureza means PURITY!:::: Borrego -- MEH-EH-EH-EH. Lamb Barbacoa was gamy and dry. The marinade was decent, but not enough to rescue the meat. I had one bite of LAMB FAT that was great, though.:::: Al Pastor -- MEH'VERAGE. All around dry, barely tasted any pork fat. The shallow marinade tasted like mild Tapatio.:::: Carnitas -- GAR'MEHGE. Chipotle-vels of CarMEHtas failure. Didn't even taste like pork. More of a dry, cotton-mouthed protein filler. Awful.- BORED-TILLAS:::: Tortillas -- NEED LOTION. Dry, and in need of moisturizing from some oil. After 4 minutes, these unlotioned tortillas absorbed too much moisture, thus becoming doughy in places, and pretty gross. Folks who prefer flour tortillas to corn tortillas do so because of tortillas LIKE THESE.- GRINGOFIED MENUMeat quality is automatically suspect if certain authentic and standard carnes aren't on the menu: no cabeza, no lengua, no tripe... This probably means that the clientele is inexperienced, and thus these delicacies will go unordered. This probably also means that the meats that are on the menu aren't going to be that awesome because the aforementioned inexperienced clientele will not demand quality.2   S T A R S* STEAK'ED THEIR CLAIM:::: Carne Asada Taco -- PURDY GOOD.

758,"I understand from friends that the meat options are tasty, but the veggie and fish burritos and tacos I've had here were poor.The staff are always friendly, and you get nice thick chips, but nothing else has been good the three times I've visited."
759,I am no Mexican food expert but I thought their burrito was solid. I had a plain old vegetarian burrito without any extras like sour cream or guacamole and I also didn't get cheese. They give you a choice of black beans or refried. I super love their salsa offerings. The tomatillo salsa and the other one (I can't remember which) are both delicious and I totally drowned every bite of my burrito with both.The burrito itself was huge but was the perfect thing after I was famished from climbing. Definitely better than Monte Cristo up the street!
760,"TL;DR 5/5 carnitas tacosCame here during dinner time, line was not too bad. I ordered 3 tacos, carnitas, carne asada, and another something taco. The sauce, cilantro, onion, everything was the perfect taste and ratio. My favorite was the carnitas, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside.

761,How come my simple to-go order can't be prepared correctly? Is asking for pico de gallo too complicated? I'm tired of getting home to find out that my food was made incorrectly.

My friend ordered the Al Pastor Burrito which was packed with some of the best marinated and juicy chunks of meat we've ever had, he ordered it with everything, both of us were surprised the burrito didn't fall apart upon first bite. It was the perfect blend of fresh and savory ingredients all enclosed in a grilled and slightly charred flour tortilla. The salsa was the only issue as it wasn't nearly as spicy nor fresh as I hoped for. Chips are not free, that was a bummer as well. Other than that, the food was solid.Price: A bit steeper than your average casual Mexican eatery, but worth the price. Ambiance: Cozy and small interior, very tight and minimal seating, but they do have a huge outdoor patio equipped with tons of natural shading from the big trees. Parking lot is behind the building.Service: The young man that took our order greeted us with a genuine smile and was very patient. Same story with the young man that brought us our food.Overall: I was getting a bit tired of driving to Oakland for Mexican food, so I'm glad I finally found fresh and decent tasting Mexican food in Berkeley. Prices are a bit steeper than I'd like, but well worth the solid tasting food and wonderful service."
789,"I've come here several times and have had great experiences each time. Be it afternoon, evening, or night, this place has fantastic service and wonderful food.Tonight hubs and I had a beer each while waiting for our order (Santa Fe salad and chile rellenos). The total came to $36 and I tipped up to $42. Seating inside is 8 small-ish tables that seat 2/3 each (booth on the back). There is more seating outside.Even when lines get long, the food comes out fast and hot. The staff are extremely friendly. There's Tapatio and tobasco and other bottles hot sauces available if you dine in."
790,Came here after a wedding and the guys that work here followed us out to our car and took pictures of our license plate as we were trying to leave. They were accusing us of knowing somebody else who they thought hit their truck. Not only will we not be back but we will be following up with this issue as this was completely uncalled for. One of the workers wanted to fight us. That's not how you run a business.
791,"This place has great food. The menu is huge, and reasonably priced. Their breakfast burritos are on point! The food is mixed traditional, authentic Mexican food as well as MexicanAmerican food (burritos, nachos).Everybody here is pretty friendly,  and I think just about everything they make is made from scratch. While you can get your food to go, this is not a ""fast-food"" restaurant, really. It could be fun to sit down there also, there's lots of tables inside and outside. A majority of the food is fresh and made to order and comes out piping-hot off the grill. Don't confuse this with some local Berkeley Taco Bell. Mission is legit, awesome, awesome food."
792,"Hands down the best Mexican food in Berkeley. The mole poblano burrito, either with chicken or carnitas is excellent, and the platanos and beans are awesome. But let me reiterate- do not miss out on the amazing mole here!!!Casual atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating, in a quiet area of Berkeley far from the university. Food is delivered to your table quickly, service is nothing outstanding, but good enough.Food is priced well for how much food you get- I paid a bit over $10 for a burrito that's probably going to keep me full for two days lolol"
793,"We had a good experience at La Mission this afternoon. We ordered tacos de papa, cocktail, and tacos de Barbacoa. Tacos were delicious, cocktail filling, lots of shrimp. Juice and sangria were so so. But overall good experience. Fresh breeze, out door  seating and friendly staff!"
794,"Super awesome taqueria right on the main drag of university avenue.They have their own small parking lot behind the building accessible via chestnut st. in addition to the usual street parking. Usually there's a spot or two available at any given time, although the super popular lunch rush can be very busy.There is pleasing inside and outside seating. The outside seating is larger then most places of this type, and is particularly nice on a sunny day, what with the natural shade provided by several friendly trees. Inside seating is the usual booth/chair combos al fast food restaurant style.  the look of the place scream re-purposed fast food chain to me, but the owners have made it all their own local styling, even if the inside is dominated by the order counter.Service  is of the order and pick up when called model. The menu consists of the usual taqueria suspects-burrito, taco, combo platters with slightly more variety. They offer the full range of meats including barbacoa, lengua, camarón (shrimp) and several different varieties of fish. There are also three different stylings of veg burrito/tacos including vegan and grilled veg options, which is nice to see. The breakfast menu is especially strong, and they have an awesome salsa/condiment bar.  Pricing for these items is fairly standard for the area about three bucks a taco and everything else pretty much starts at 7 bucks. Typically a meal will run about ten dollars with a drink and add ons, but it's possible to go the bare bones bargain route for slightly less. It's the flavor, convenience, and quality of the food that really shines here.One of the better lunch/breakfast options for the area for sure."
795,"Solid, good, authentic mexican food.   Whether you want tacos, enchiladas, tortas, burritos, pozole, etc., this place does not disappoint.Highly recommend for the price and the service.  There is also a parking lot and great outdoor seating."
796,I have frequently passed by this place but never gave it any thought to stop by but with the recommendation we decided to stop in for lunch I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and good this place actually was Food: grilled chicken tacos & steak (good) blk beans & rice everything was fresh the food was heavy which I liked and I like the way the meat  was cut into small pieces because I definitely dislike big chunks of meat with a lot of fat Service: fastAmbience: gives u a little feel of a little taqueria in Mexico Conclusion: better than I thought I will definitely return I love their chicken tacos and their rice and beans everything was fresh very tasty very good light and healthy I would say give this place a try
797,"Taco Trek Lesson 3, THE TORTILLA. The CORN tortilla is the double-layered  backbone of the taco experience, setting the tone for moisture and texture throughout the bite. The flavor of the corn is the floor upon which the flavors of the meat, fat, and toppings dance the Salsa! When talk-talking tacos, there are two types of corn tortillas to consider: fresh-made and factory-made.* Fresh tortillas are rare. If you're lucky enough to find tortillas rolled out ON-THE-SPOT from a press, quality is a WRAP! Fresh corn tortillas are always perfectly moist and tender, and need minimal added fat. The experience is like eating supple wontons or dumplings; the fresh tortilla is as pliable as soft cloth, and the corn never wads up into dry unpleasantness in the back of your mouth. Fresh tortillas, however, have zero shelf-life, and thus we get to...* Factory tortillas, which are common. Tortillas made in a factory have added preservatives and binding agents that make them dense, dry, and disgusting -- but they can be made awesome again through the absorption of enough fat on a hot griddle! Simply steaming factory tortillas is UNACCEPTABLE to a tacossieur like me, because they get doughy and taste acidic. Automatic Taco Fail!* Pro-tip: You can tell the QUALITY of a corn tortilla just from a TACO PHOTO. :::: Positively Awesome: 1) Round corners at the folds, 2) Oil-stained, deep color, 3) some shine on the surface -- tender and moist, let's rejoice! 4) Greased spots of golden-brown -- crisped on the griddle to be chewy in the middle!:::: God-Awful: 1) Sharp corners at the folded edges -- MEH, mostly dry. 2) Light-colored, dry-looking surface -- cotton-mouth! Keep away! 3) Wet, doughy-looking surface (sure sign of gringo tacos) -- acidic YUCKTOWN._______ Strictly a review of La Mission's TACOS _______Tacos were sadly MEH-diocre. I suspect the overall 4-star review was was given by burrito-eaters that are HIGHLY FORGIVING of crappy meats. Time to take a BART ride to the Fruitvale for some real-deal taco trucks, my Gringos. Check out my TACO TREK LIST to get you started.3   M I N U S E S- FAILS de CARNESRemember, tacos are all about delivering delicious MEAT-DECADENCE into your mouth. No hiding the flavor of the meat with cheese, lettuce, beans, rice, guac, cream, etc. Pureza means PURITY!:::: Borrego -- MEH-EH-EH-EH. Lamb Barbacoa was gamy and dry. The marinade was decent, but not enough to rescue the meat. I had one bite of LAMB FAT that was great, though.:::: Al Pastor -- MEH'VERAGE. All around dry, barely tasted any pork fat. The shallow marinade tasted like mild Tapatio.:::: Carnitas -- GAR'MEHGE. Chipotle-vels of CarMEHtas failure. Didn't even taste like pork. More of a dry, cotton-mouthed protein filler. Awful.- BORED-TILLAS:::: Tortillas -- NEED LOTION. Dry, and in need of moisturizing from some oil. After 4 minutes, these unlotioned tortillas absorbed too much moisture, thus becoming doughy in places, and pretty gross. Folks who prefer flour tortillas to corn tortillas do so because of tortillas LIKE THESE.- GRINGOFIED MENUMeat quality is automatically suspect if certain authentic and standard carnes aren't on the menu: no cabeza, no lengua, no tripe... This probably means that the clientele is inexperienced, and thus these delicacies will go unordered. This probably also means that the meats that are on the menu aren't going to be that awesome because the aforementioned inexperienced clientele will not demand quality.2   S T A R S* STEAK'ED THEIR CLAIM:::: Carne Asada Taco -- PURDY GOOD.

Thank you so much guys!*(1/2) LOVELY OUTDOOR SPACEBring your beer to the pretty lil outdoor space with a trellis for shade, and enough tables to seat about 20."
798,"I understand from friends that the meat options are tasty, but the veggie and fish burritos and tacos I've had here were poor.The staff are always friendly, and you get nice thick chips, but nothing else has been good the three times I've visited."
799,I am no Mexican food expert but I thought their burrito was solid. I had a plain old vegetarian burrito without any extras like sour cream or guacamole and I also didn't get cheese. They give you a choice of black beans or refried. I super love their salsa offerings. The tomatillo salsa and the other one (I can't remember which) are both delicious and I totally drowned every bite of my burrito with both.The burrito itself was huge but was the perfect thing after I was famished from climbing. Definitely better than Monte Cristo up the street!
800,"TL;DR 5/5 carnitas tacosCame here during dinner time, line was not too bad. I ordered 3 tacos, carnitas, carne asada, and another something taco. The sauce, cilantro, onion, everything was the perfect taste and ratio. My favorite was the carnitas, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. They have a wide variety of items on their menu, and I will definitely be back to try the rest!This is my friend's top taco place in Berkeley, and I would also put this at the top of my list.La Mission is accessible via AC Transit 51B or car (small parking lot in the back)."
801,How come my simple to-go order can't be prepared correctly? Is asking for pico de gallo too complicated? I'm tired of getting home to find out that my food was made incorrectly. I try to keep any additions simple. I think I forgot why I like La Mission. I'm finished hoping you'll get my order right.
802,"we got off our night shift and went here for breakfast. There was no wait time at all, the restaurant just opened for the day. we were first customers. restaurant was very clean. There was a breakfast menu and we could order from full menu. we also ordered pitcher of sangria - which was  great.4 star for food. felt like food was cooked quick, slightly undercooked. 5 star for service. Will def stop by here for more food"
803,"I so wanted breakfast, My meeting ran late so I had to settle for the tacos. The grilled fish taco was good. The Tacos al pastor were ok. Not great although not bad. Tortillas are small although they make up for the amount of meat they put on. Salsa did not have much flavor. The staff was friendly and I will be back for the breakfast."
804,"Best spot in Berkeley for Mexican food.  My favorite is the baja fish taco, $5.50.  I thought it was expensive for one taco but it is huge!  They give a generous serving of fish, crema, cabbage, and tomatoes.  I love the breading of the fish, giving a nice crispy texture with moist fish inside, and the crema makes for a great flavor combo.  Delish!The horchata is really sweet, but becomes perfect when the ice melts.  This place has got friendly staff, a great vibe, is clean, has outside garden seating, and also boasts a parking lot in the back to top it off (no Berkeley street parking necessary)."
805,"Service was efficient and friendly, but La Mission's chicken dishes leave everything to be desired. If you eat pork, they have your back (the pozole for example), but the chicken is literally tiny dry cubes of meat with no flavor. I spent 17$ and change on two street tacos a small salad and one beer. Seemed outrageously high relative to the quality and amount of food. Maybe the other tacos are just so much more delicious? If I were them I would pull all the cubed chicken off the menu. The green salad was good, though sparse. I liked that it had pepitas, cabbage shreds and a vinaigrette dressing. Not sure I would come back just for that though with so many other amazing Mexican places around the area. Sad because I really wanted to love this place!"
806,"This is by far my favorite taco place in the bay area!The grand tacos here has 2 shells (1 soft 1 hard) and has more fillings than normal tacos. I normally go for the beef and the fish taco while my husband will have these 2 and a pork one as well. The fish is always crispy outside and tender inside, with a light dressing to compliment the flavor. The beef taco doesn't skim on the beef quantity like a lot other places. We also like the nachos here. In fact it is the favorite dish for my mother who comes from China. The service is slightly slow here but that's because they make everything fresh. It's a wait I'm willing to have for good quality food。"

832,"Hands down the best Mexican food in Berkeley. The mole poblano burrito, either with chicken or carnitas is excellent, and the platanos and beans are awesome. But let me reiterate- do not miss out on the amazing mole here!!!Casual atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating, in a quiet area of Berkeley far from the university. Food is delivered to your table quickly, service is nothing outstanding, but good enough.Food is priced well for how much food you get- I paid a bit over $10 for a burrito that's probably going to keep me full for two days lolol"
833,"We had a good experience at La Mission this afternoon. We ordered tacos de papa, cocktail, and tacos de Barbacoa. Tacos were delicious, cocktail filling, lots of shrimp. Juice and sangria were so so. But overall good experience. Fresh breeze, out door  seating and friendly staff!"
834,"Super awesome taqueria right on the main drag of university avenue.They have their own small parking lot behind the building accessible via chestnut st. in addition to the usual street parking. Usually there's a spot or two available at any given time, although the super popular lunch rush can be very busy.There is pleasing inside and outside seating. The outside seating is larger then most places of this type, and is particularly nice on a sunny day, what with the natural shade provided by several friendly trees. Inside seating is the usual booth/chair combos al fast food restaurant style.  the look of the place scream re-purposed fast food chain to me, but the owners have made it all their own local styling, even if the inside is dominated by the order counter.Service  is of the order and pick up when called model. The menu consists of the usual taqueria suspects-burrito, taco, combo platters with slightly more variety. They offer the full range of meats including barbacoa, lengua, camarón (shrimp) and several different varieties of fish. There are also three different stylings of veg burrito/tacos including vegan and grilled veg options, which is nice to see. The breakfast menu is especially strong, and they have an awesome salsa/condiment bar.  Pricing for these items is fairly standard for the area about three bucks a taco and everything else pretty much starts at 7 bucks. Typically a meal will run about ten dollars with a drink and add ons, but it's possible to go the bare bones bargain route for slightly less. It's the flavor, convenience, and quality of the food that really shines here.One of the better lunch/breakfast options for the area for sure."
835,"Solid, good, authentic mexican food.   Whether you want tacos, enchiladas, tortas, burritos, pozole, etc., this place does not disappoint.Highly recommend for the price and the service.  There is also a parking lot and great outdoor seating."
836,I have frequently passed by this place but never gave it any thought to stop by but with the recommendation we decided to stop in for lunch I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and good this place actually was Food: grilled chicken tacos & steak (good) blk beans & rice everything was fresh the food was heavy which I liked and I like the way the meat  was cut into small pieces because I definitely dislike big chunks of meat with a lot of fat Service: fastAmbience: gives u a little feel of a little taqueria in Mexico Conclusion: better than I thought I will definitely return I love their chicken tacos and their rice and beans everything was fresh very tasty very good light and healthy I would say give this place a try
837,"Taco Trek Lesson 3, THE TORTILLA. The CORN tortilla is the double-layered  backbone of the taco experience, setting the tone for moisture and texture throughout the bite. The flavor of the corn is the floor upon which the flavors of the meat, fat, and toppings dance the Salsa! When talk-talking tacos, there are two types of corn tortillas to consider: fresh-made and factory-made.* Fresh tortillas are rare. If you're lucky enough to find tortillas rolled out ON-THE-SPOT from a press, quality is a WRAP! Fresh corn tortillas are always perfectly moist and tender, and need minimal added fat. The experience is like eating supple wontons or dumplings; the fresh tortilla is as pliable as soft cloth, and the corn never wads up into dry unpleasantness in the back of your mouth. Fresh tortillas, however, have zero shelf-life, and thus we get to...* Factory tortillas, which are common. Tortillas made in a factory have added preservatives and binding agents that make them dense, dry, and disgusting -- but they can be made awesome again through the absorption of enough fat on a hot griddle! Simply steaming factory tortillas is UNACCEPTABLE to a tacossieur like me, because they get doughy and taste acidic. Automatic Taco Fail!* Pro-tip: You can tell the QUALITY of a corn tortilla just from a TACO PHOTO. :::: Positively Awesome: 1) Round corners at the folds, 2) Oil-stained, deep color, 3) some shine on the surface -- tender and moist, let's rejoice! 4) Greased spots of golden-brown -- crisped on the griddle to be chewy in the middle!:::: God-Awful: 1) Sharp corners at the folded edges -- MEH, mostly dry. 2) Light-colored, dry-looking surface -- cotton-mouth! Keep away! 3) Wet, doughy-looking surface (sure sign of gringo tacos) -- acidic YUCKTOWN._______ Strictly a review of La Mission's TACOS _______Tacos were sadly MEH-diocre. I suspect the overall 4-star review was was given by burrito-eaters that are HIGHLY FORGIVING of crappy meats. Time to take a BART ride to the Fruitvale for some real-deal taco trucks, my Gringos. Check out my TACO TREK LIST to get you started.3   M I N U S E S- FAILS de CARNESRemember, tacos are all about delivering delicious MEAT-DECADENCE into your mouth. No hiding the flavor of the meat with cheese, lettuce, beans, rice, guac, cream, etc. Pureza means PURITY!:::: Borrego -- MEH-EH-EH-EH. Lamb Barbacoa was gamy and dry. The marinade was decent, but not enough to rescue the meat. I had one bite of LAMB FAT that was great, though.:::: Al Pastor -- MEH'VERAGE. All around dry, barely tasted any pork fat. The shallow marinade tasted like mild Tapatio.:::: Carnitas -- GAR'MEHGE. Chipotle-vels of CarMEHtas failure. Didn't even taste like pork. More of a dry, cotton-mouthed protein filler. Awful.- BORED-TILLAS:::: Tortillas -- NEED LOTION. Dry, and in need of moisturizing from some oil. After 4 minutes, these unlotioned tortillas absorbed too much moisture, thus becoming doughy in places, and pretty gross. Folks who prefer flour tortillas to corn tortillas do so because of tortillas LIKE THESE.- GRINGOFIED MENUMeat quality is automatically suspect if certain authentic and standard carnes aren't on the menu: no cabeza, no lengua, no tripe... This probably means that the clientele is inexperienced, and thus these delicacies will go unordered. This probably also means that the meats that are on the menu aren't going to be that awesome because the aforementioned inexperienced clientele will not demand quality.2   S T A R S* STEAK'ED THEIR CLAIM:::: Carne Asada Taco -- PURDY GOOD. Although the morsels alone seemed dry, biting into a mouthful of steak produced lovely moisture, and smoky flavor.*(1/2) BRIGHT-EYED SERVICEWelcoming, attentive, and bright-eyed friendliness from everyone I interacted with. Thank you so much guys!*(1/2) LOVELY OUTDOOR SPACEBring your beer to the pretty lil outdoor space with a trellis for shade, and enough tables to seat about 20."
838,"I understand from friends that the meat options are tasty, but the veggie and fish burritos and tacos I've had here were poor.The staff are always friendly, and you get nice thick chips, but nothing else has been good the three times I've visited."
839,I am no Mexican food expert but I thought their burrito was solid. I had a plain old vegetarian burrito without any extras like sour cream or guacamole and I also didn't get cheese. They give you a choice of black beans or refried. I super love their salsa offerings. The tomatillo salsa and the other one (I can't remember which) are both delicious and I totally drowned every bite of my burrito with both.The burrito itself was huge but was the perfect thing after I was famished from climbing. Definitely better than Monte Cristo up the street!
840,"TL;DR 5/5 carnitas tacosCame here during dinner time, line was not too bad. I ordered 3 tacos, carnitas, carne asada, and another something taco. The sauce, cilantro, onion, everything was the perfect taste and ratio. My favorite was the carnitas, juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. They have a wide variety of items on their menu, and I will definitely be back to try the rest!This is my friend's top taco place in Berkeley, and I would also put this at the top of my list.La Mission is accessible via AC Transit 51B or car (small parking lot in the back)."
841,How come my simple to-go order can't be prepared correctly? Is asking for pico de gallo too complicated? I'm tired of getting home to find out that my food was made incorrectly. I try to keep any additions simple. I think I forgot why I like La Mission. I'm finished hoping you'll get my order right.
842,"we got off our night shift and went here for breakfast. There was no wait time at all, the restaurant just opened for the day. we were first customers. restaurant was very clean. There was a breakfast menu and we could order from full menu. we also ordered pitcher of sangria - which was  great.4 star for food. felt like food was cooked quick, slightly undercooked. 5 star for service. Will def stop by here for more food"
843,"I so wanted breakfast, My meeting ran late so I had to settle for the tacos. The grilled fish taco was good. The Tacos al pastor were ok. Not great although not bad. Tortillas are small although they make up for the amount of meat they put on. Salsa did not have much flavor. The staff was friendly and I will be back for the breakfast."
844,"Best spot in Berkeley for Mexican food.  My favorite is the baja fish taco, $5.50.  I thought it was expensive for one taco but it is huge!  They give a generous serving of fish, crema, cabbage, and tomatoes.  I love the breading of the fish, giving a nice crispy texture with moist fish inside, and the crema makes for a great flavor combo.  Delish!The horchata is really sweet, but becomes perfect when the ice melts.  This place has got friendly staff, a great vibe, is clean, has outside garden seating, and also boasts a parking lot in the back to top it off (no Berkeley street parking necessary)."
845,"Service was efficient and friendly, but La Mission's chicken dishes leave everything to be desired. If you eat pork, they have your back (the pozole for example), but the chicken is literally tiny dry cubes of meat with no flavor. I spent 17$ and change on two street tacos a small salad and one beer. Seemed outrageously high relative to the quality and amount of food. Maybe the other tacos are just so much more delicious? If I were them I would pull all the cubed chicken off the menu. The green salad was good, though sparse. I liked that it had pepitas, cabbage shreds and a vinaigrette dressing. Not sure I would come back just for that though with so many other amazing Mexican places around the area. Sad because I really wanted to love this place!"
846,"This is by far my favorite taco place in the bay area!The grand tacos here has 2 shells (1 soft 1 hard) and has more fillings than normal tacos. I normally go for the beef and the fish taco while my husband will have these 2 and a pork one as well. The fish is always crispy outside and tender inside, with a light dressing to compliment the flavor. The beef taco doesn't skim on the beef quantity like a lot other places. We also like the nachos here. In fact it is the favorite dish for my mother who comes from China. The service is slightly slow here but that's because they make everything fresh. It's a wait I'm willing to have for good quality food。"
847,Best Mexican food in Berkeley. Really really fresh meats and diverse vegetarian choices. Excellent moles and savory menudo. Perfect snacking for a summer afternoon.
848,"Mission Accomplished. Decent Mexican food found in Berkeley!Food: Have your pick from tacos to burritos, soups, entree plates, aguas frescas and even some fresh desserts if you're sweet tooth kicks in. I went with a simple and classic cheesy quesadilla, but added prawns to fancy it up a bit. Oozing with cheesy, grilled to near perfection and boasting with fresh flavors of chopped prawns; it was truly delicious. My friend ordered the Al Pastor Burrito which was packed with some of the best marinated and juicy chunks of meat we've ever had, he ordered it with everything, both of us were surprised the burrito didn't fall apart upon first bite. It was the perfect blend of fresh and savory ingredients all enclosed in a grilled and slightly charred flour tortilla. The salsa was the only issue as it wasn't nearly as spicy nor fresh as I hoped for. Chips are not free, that was a bummer as well. Other than that, the food was solid.Price: A bit steeper than your average casual Mexican eatery, but worth the price. Ambiance: Cozy and small interior, very tight and minimal seating, but they do have a huge outdoor patio equipped with tons of natural shading from the big trees. Parking lot is behind the building.Service: The young man that took our order greeted us with a genuine smile and was very patient. Same story with the young man that brought us our food.Overall: I was getting a bit tired of driving to Oakland for Mexican food, so I'm glad I finally found fresh and decent tasting Mexican food in Berkeley. Prices are a bit steeper than I'd like, but well worth the solid tasting food and wonderful service."
849,"I've come here several times and have had great experiences each time. Be it afternoon, evening, or night, this place has fantastic service and wonderful food.Tonight hubs and I had a beer each while waiting for our order (Santa Fe salad and chile rellenos). The total came to $36 and I tipped up to $42. Seating inside is 8 small-ish tables that seat 2/3 each (booth on the back). There is more seating outside.Even when lines get long, the food comes out fast and hot. The staff are extremely friendly. There's Tapatio and tobasco and other bottles hot sauces available if you dine in."
850,Came here after a wedding and the guys that work here followed us out to our car and took pictures of our license plate as we were trying to leave. They were accusing us of knowing somebody else who they thought hit their truck. Not only will we not be back but we will be following up with this issue as this was completely uncalled for. One of the workers wanted to fight us. That's not how you run a business.
851,"This place has great food. The menu is huge, and reasonably priced. Their breakfast burritos are on point!

876,I have frequently passed by this place but never gave it any thought to stop by but with the recommendation we decided to stop in for lunch I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and good this place actually was Food: grilled chicken tacos & steak (good) blk beans & rice everything was fresh the food was heavy which I liked and I like the way the meat  was cut into small pieces because I definitely dislike big chunks of meat with a lot of fat Service: fastAmbience: gives u a little feel of a little taqueria in Mexico Conclusion: better than I thought I will definitely return I love their chicken tacos and their rice and beans everything was fresh very tasty very good light and healthy I would say give this place a try
877,"Taco Trek Lesson 3, THE TORTILLA. The CORN tortilla is the double-layered  backbone of the taco experience, setting the tone for moisture and texture throughout the bite. The flavor of the corn is the floor upon which the flavors of the meat, fat, and toppings dance the Salsa! When talk-talking tacos, there are two types of corn tortillas to consider: fresh-made and factory-made.* Fresh tortillas are rare. If you're lucky enough to find tortillas rolled out ON-THE-SPOT from a press, quality is a WRAP! Fresh corn tortillas are always perfectly moist and tender, and need minimal added fat. The experience is like eating supple wontons or dumplings; the fresh tortilla is as pliable as soft cloth, and the corn never wads up into dry unpleasantness in the back of your mouth. Fresh tortillas, however, have zero shelf-life, and thus we get to...* Factory tortillas, which are common. Tortillas made in a factory have added preservatives and binding agents that make them dense, dry, and disgusting -- but they can be made awesome again through the absorption of enough fat on a hot griddle! Simply steaming factory tortillas is UNACCEPTABLE to a tacossieur like me, because they get doughy and taste acidic. Automatic Taco Fail!* Pro-tip: You can tell the QUALITY of a corn tortilla just from a TACO PHOTO. :::: Positively Awesome: 1) Round corners at the folds, 2) Oil-stained, deep color, 3) some shine on the surface -- tender and moist, let's rejoice! 4) Greased spots of golden-brown -- crisped on the griddle to be chewy in the middle!:::: God-Awful: 1) Sharp corners at the folded edges -- MEH, mostly dry. 2) Light-colored, dry-looking surface -- cotton-mouth! Keep away! 3) Wet, doughy-looking surface (sure sign of gringo tacos) -- acidic YUCKTOWN._______ Strictly a review of La Mission's TACOS _______Tacos were sadly MEH-diocre. I suspect the overall 4-star review was was given by burrito-eaters that are HIGHLY FORGIVING of crappy meats. Time to take a BART ride to the Fruitvale for some real-deal taco trucks, my Gringos. Check out my TACO TREK LIST to get you started.3   M I N U S E S- FAILS de CARNESRemember, tacos are all about delivering delicious MEAT-DECADENCE into your mouth. No hiding the flavor of the meat with cheese, lettuce, beans, rice, guac, cream, etc. Pureza means PURITY!:::: Borrego -- MEH-EH-EH-EH. Lamb Barbacoa was gamy and dry. The marinade was decent, but not enough to rescue the meat. I had one bite of LAMB FAT that was great, though.:::: Al Pastor -- MEH'VERAGE. All around dry, barely tasted any pork fat. The shallow marinade tasted like mild Tapatio.:::: Carnitas -- GAR'MEHGE. Chipotle-vels of CarMEHtas failure. Didn't even taste like pork. More of a dry, cotton-mouthed protein filler. Awful.- BORED-TILLAS:::: Tortillas -- NEED LOTION. Dry, and in need of moisturizing from some oil. After 4 minutes, these unlotioned tortillas absorbed too much moisture, thus becoming doughy in places, and pretty gross. Folks who prefer flour tortillas to corn tortillas do so because of tortillas LIKE THESE.- GRINGOFIED MENUMeat quality is automatically suspect if certain authentic and standard carnes aren't on the menu: no cabeza, no lengua, no tripe... This probably means that the clientele is inexperienced, and thus these delicacies will go unordered. This probably also means that the meats that are on the menu aren't going to be that awesome because the aforementioned inexperienced clientele will not demand quality.2   S T A R S* STEAK'ED THEIR CLAIM:::: Carne Asada Taco -- PURDY GOOD. Although the morsels alone seemed dry, biting into a mouthful of steak produced lovely moisture, and smoky flavor.*(1/2) BRIGHT-EYED SERVICEWelcoming, attentive, and bright-eyed friendliness from everyone I interacted with. Thank you so much guys!*(1/2) LOVELY OUTDOOR SPACEBring your beer to the pretty lil outdoor space with a trellis for shade, and enough tables to seat about 20."
878,"I understand from friends that the meat options are tasty, but the veggie and fish burritos and tacos I've had here were poor.The staff are always friendly, and you get nice thick chips, but nothing else has been good the three times I've visited."
879,I am no Mexican food expert but I thought their burrito was solid. I had a plain old vegetarian burrito without any extras like sour cream or guacamole and I also didn't get cheese. They give you a choice of black beans or refried. I super love their salsa offerings. The tomatillo salsa and the other one (I can't remember which) are both delicious and I totally drowned every bite of my burrito with both.The burrito itself was huge but was the perfect thing after I was famished from climbing. Definitely better than Monte Cristo up the street!
