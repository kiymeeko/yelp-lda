0,"Service was excellent. The staff was friendly & attentive.Chicken & veggie momos were tasty. Pretty large portion and filling.The ""aloo bhanta"" eggplant vegetarian dish was delicious.Naan was perfect. Will definitely return soon."
1,"I was really disappointed with the restaurant especially knowing it has 4stars rating on Yelp.The momos was hardly comparable to the ones I've had in Hong Kong. The lamb was still a bit uncooked. (I had stomach problem later in the day, not sure if related to this.) Quite a few of them also had broken skins.Samosa was dry and pretty bland. The garlic naan was good and probably the only decent dish of all.Chicken Tikka Masala had nice sauce but the chicken itself was pretty dry. Shrimp vindaloo was okay but there were only a few shrimps inside.The mango lassi had too much yoghort inside and I couldn't really taste the mango.Overall the serving portions were really small (except for the momos, which we couldn't even finish) and the taste was barely okay.This was probably one of the worst meals I've had this year. Definitely not coming back here."
2,"Got the Groupon for this restaurant and had lunch there recently. This restaurant is nicely situated next to some other cool shops and restaurants in Berkeley. I had high hopes for this restaurant delivering on some quality Indian and Nepalese cuisine.There was not a lot of flexibility on where we could sit, despite the near empty restaurant. We were steered towards a small table in the back and middle of the room. I think I was seated in the darkest part of the restaurant - highly recommend sitting closer to the windows with sunlight streaming in or center of the dining room.Service was delivered with a smile but was pretty slow. The mixed biryani was fairly bland. Samosas were just OK - needed more flavor and seemed to have used the bare minimum in spices. Don't be fooled by the value offered by the Groupon - unless this place can up the taste and flavor of its entrees, it's not worth spending your time or energy trying to dine here.UPDATED: After I posted this, Manny A. sent me the following note, labelled as a ""compliment""Manny A.San Francisco, CA 0 friends 4 reviews 4 photos Just a Note 5/18/2017For your review of: Taste of the Himalayas""Looks like your very sensitive person.i don't know your age but you sound like a lil cry baby""Wonder if the owner of the Taste of the Himalayas got upset and had his buddy bro send me this nastygram...lol. In any event, I guess the truth hurts, and my review upset someone. Sorry, next time do better."
3,"There is such a positive vibe in this place, from the friendly ""Namaste"" greeting to the beautiful decor.Service was fast and friendly, which is always a plus.We ordered the chicken tikka masala, shrimp korma, and garlic naan bread. All of which was season to perfect. Our meals were served with lentil soup, which was also very tasty."
4,"First time here, saw a deal on Groupon and bought it because of the reviews. We ordered on the phone since the Groupon was for take out ($20 for $10). 1. We ordered lamb tarkari and 2 garlic naans and this was about $25 before applying the Groupon. Along with our order, we got some kind of soup and a side of rice. I was really happy about the rice because I didn't expect it.2. I've had better lamb curries in my life. There were a lot of lamb chunks but they weren't tender. This lamb was slightly overcooked. The curry itself lacked spice. 3. The garlic naan was probably the highlight of our meal. I wish they didn't wrap it in foil because the naan became slightly soggy. 4. I wish they told us what kind of soup they gave us though. It was kind of squash-y and pea-y - couldn't really tell but it lacked flavor."
5,Momos mean dumplings and that's their specialty here. I like their lamb momos. It's lightly on the gamey side. Tikka masala is nicely creamy. Rice and naan was spot on.Calming decor vibes and service was friendly.
6,"(Preface: I absolutely love Indian food, having been spoiled by authentic and affordable cuisine in central Jersey.) So the lamb kadai was only alright: the sauce was pretty standard and the lamb was fattier than the lamb kadai I've had at other places. The portion was small but filling. I went with a party of 20 and I'm pretty sure most people's reactions were that the size was much smaller than expected. The momo's (dumplings) were quite nice and had strong tang of ginger in the filling, which I love, but may not be everyone's  cup of tea. Some issues that made me *almost* bump this review to 2 stars:I ordered a red wine, which was fine, but was dismayed to find the dregs at the bottom of the glass (see pictures). That should never, ever happen. I mean, would you serve your friends the dregs from the bottom of the bottle?? Another member of my party waited a good 10 minutes for her naan to come out. They gave her twice the portion to make up for it, but she didn't need more...she just needed it to be ready with her warm dish when it first came out. I tried the naan too -- it was a bit thick and undercooked for my taste. It was also bland."
7,"8/6/16: Sorry, it's been too long since I ate here, and I've forgotten most of the details except my overall impression.  My friend talked it up before we got here, so I was expecting something pretty special and yummy, but to be honest, this food is extremely similar to Indian.  Of course, I'm not Indian so I'm sure they'd disagree, but for the rest of us, I doubt there's too huge of a difference.  For instance, they got nan's, though I guess the difference would be it's spelled ""nan"" instead of ""naan.""  But otherwise, tastes the same.  The curries taste the same too.  I think just about the only thing we tried that they don't have at Indian restaurants would be the dumplings.Anyway, this is what we had:1. Mango Lassi $3.502. Cono Sur Reisling $73. #2 Vegetable Pakora (5 Pieces) $4.95 ""mixed golden-fried vegetable fritters, served with mint sauce"":  Was okay. Like the fried vegetables at Indian buffets. 5/104. #9 Mixed Momo $10.95 ""momo sampler platter; 3 pieces of chicken, lamb and vegetable momo, served with tomato chutney""5. Nan of the month Badami Nan $3.95 ""stuffed cherry and nuts"":  Tastes like a PBJ sandwich. Really odd. Better suited for dessert. No one ate it after a bite. 3/106. Special #1 Baigain Bhartha $12.95 ""tandoor roasted eggplant, mashed and tempered with garlic and mustard seeds, then cooked with green peas in onion tomato based sauce"":  I remember this actually tasted pretty good, with a wonderfully tasty sauce. 7/107. #31 Himalayan Balti $15.95 ""assorted pieces of chicken breast, lamb cubes, shrimps, cauliflower, and potatoes cooked in house special sauce"":  Don't remember details except it wasn't that impressive. 5/108. Special #4 Lamb Kadai $14.95 with Garlic Nan $1.50 ""slow cooked boneless leg of lamb sauteed with onion and bell peppers then cooked with tomato and onion based gravy"":  Same deal. Tasted fine but nothing special. 5/103/5#himalayan #napalese #indian #naan #nan"
8,"Food was alright didn't really had taste to it everything tasted the same except the Chicken they were pretty good,Mango lassi tasted like over dose of yogurt no mango flavor Make sure to ask them for utensils when you order for delivery they do not even include napkins"
9,"One of the worst restaurant meals I've ever had. Dishwater broth, Naan was greasy and under cooked. The rest of the meal was poor in taste and portion.Service was rude and incompetent.This was a couple of years ago, perhaps they've improved but I won't know. Only blocks from home, but it was so bad I'll never go back."
10,One of my all time favorite restaurants. The food is fabulous the Naan is to die for and the service is friendly and fast and professional.
11,I've eaten here before and it was good. Recently I had a to-go order that took forever.I randomly (probably starvingly) wanted samosas. I called and ordered.They claimed it would be ready in 10mins. I arrived. Then I had to wait an additional 20 mins. Not fun at all. The samosas were ok. But I don't like waiting so I think I would hesitate to go back in fear of waiting an eternity.
12,"There isn't a glimmer of doubt in my mind that this is the finest Indian food I've tasted. These flavors jump boldly off the plate and unabashedly embrace the palette. Carefully developed balances of spice, savory, sweet, and sour seem to engage in some ancient dance to produce a dazzling and mystifying culinary experience. Combined with tasteful decor, excellent service, and a menu overflowing with vegan and vegetarian dishes, I eagerly anticipate my next visit to Taste of the Himalayas."
13,"I REALLY enjoy spicy Indian food and this restaurant got it right! The goat Biriyani was fantastic. The raita could have had more cucumber but was very good.I enjoyed the dall as well. One star off for the dryness of the rice.I will eat here more often and try other things. Their vegetarian menu looks fantastic, so I may eat here at least twice a monthBerkeley has a lot of Indian restaurants, but the great flavors here and the reasonable prices win my heart and wallet"
14,I have been to Taste of the Himalayas multiple times.  It has always been a very positive experience.  The people are courteous.  The food is VERY authentic and so delicious.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.My only criticism: I wish they were open for Sunday lunch. That way I can avoid the craziness of Berkeley traffic and parking.
15,I love Taste of the Himalayan restaurant. I basically tried momo and mango lassi they have and the service and staff are friendly.
16,"The food and service were great , quality of the food overall I would say is pretty goood especially after trying from various indian restaurants around I give this place a thumbs up ! Also With anything you order , you get a free lentil soup and rice with your order while you wait  , which was awesome and unexpected by me !"
17,Fabulous food. Highly highly recommend. The mixed momo is the way to go. Best Indian food in east bay.
18,"This is really my favorite indian food lately.  Some old standard indian places have let me down lately, but this is consistently good, and their lunch special is cool with a nice assortment of different things.  Just wish they included Palak Paneer as a choice.  Nice ambiance and drinks selection too- okay for a quick work lunch or for celebrating a nicer meal."
19,"Weeknight dinner. Chicken tikka masala (mild) with brown rice was delicious, as were the delicately buttered naan bread and the lentil soup. Comfortable atmosphere and amiable, welcoming, attentive, and helpful staff. Hope to return soon to try more dishes."

(I had stomach problem later in the day, not sure if related to this.) Quite a few of them also had broken skins.Samosa was dry and pretty bland. The garlic naan was good and probably the only decent dish of all.Chicken Tikka Masala had nice sauce but the chicken itself was pretty dry. Shrimp vindaloo was okay but there were only a few shrimps inside.The mango lassi had too much yoghort inside and I couldn't really taste the mango.Overall the serving portions were really small (except for the momos, which we couldn't even finish) and the taste was barely okay.This was probably one of the worst meals I've had this year. Definitely not coming back here."
62,"Got the Groupon for this restaurant and had lunch there recently. This restaurant is nicely situated next to some other cool shops and restaurants in Berkeley. I had high hopes for this restaurant delivering on some quality Indian and Nepalese cuisine.There was not a lot of flexibility on where we could sit, despite the near empty restaurant. We were steered towards a small table in the back and middle of the room. I think I was seated in the darkest part of the restaurant - highly recommend sitting closer to the windows with sunlight streaming in or center of the dining room.Service was delivered with a smile but was pretty slow. The mixed biryani was fairly bland. Samosas were just OK - needed more flavor and seemed to have used the bare minimum in spices. Don't be fooled by the value offered by the Groupon - unless this place can up the taste and flavor of its entrees, it's not worth spending your time or energy trying to dine here.UPDATED: After I posted this, Manny A. sent me the following note, labelled as a ""compliment""Manny A.San Francisco, CA 0 friends 4 reviews 4 photos Just a Note 5/18/2017For your review of: Taste of the Himalayas""Looks like your very sensitive person.i don't know your age but you sound like a lil cry baby""Wonder if the owner of the Taste of the Himalayas got upset and had his buddy bro send me this nastygram...lol. In any event, I guess the truth hurts, and my review upset someone. Sorry, next time do better."
63,"There is such a positive vibe in this place, from the friendly ""Namaste"" greeting to the beautiful decor.Service was fast and friendly, which is always a plus.We ordered the chicken tikka masala, shrimp korma, and garlic naan bread. All of which was season to perfect. Our meals were served with lentil soup, which was also very tasty."
64,"First time here, saw a deal on Groupon and bought it because of the reviews. We ordered on the phone since the Groupon was for take out ($20 for $10). 1. We ordered lamb tarkari and 2 garlic naans and this was about $25 before applying the Groupon. Along with our order, we got some kind of soup and a side of rice. I was really happy about the rice because I didn't expect it.2. I've had better lamb curries in my life. There were a lot of lamb chunks but they weren't tender. This lamb was slightly overcooked. The curry itself lacked spice. 3. The garlic naan was probably the highlight of our meal. I wish they didn't wrap it in foil because the naan became slightly soggy. 4. I wish they told us what kind of soup they gave us though. It was kind of squash-y and pea-y - couldn't really tell but it lacked flavor."
65,Momos mean dumplings and that's their specialty here. I like their lamb momos. It's lightly on the gamey side. Tikka masala is nicely creamy. Rice and naan was spot on.Calming decor vibes and service was friendly.
66,"(Preface: I absolutely love Indian food, having been spoiled by authentic and affordable cuisine in central Jersey.) So the lamb kadai was only alright: the sauce was pretty standard and the lamb was fattier than the lamb kadai I've had at other places. The portion was small but filling. I went with a party of 20 and I'm pretty sure most people's reactions were that the size was much smaller than expected. The momo's (dumplings) were quite nice and had strong tang of ginger in the filling, which I love, but may not be everyone's  cup of tea. Some issues that made me *almost* bump this review to 2 stars:I ordered a red wine, which was fine, but was dismayed to find the dregs at the bottom of the glass (see pictures). That should never, ever happen. I mean, would you serve your friends the dregs from the bottom of the bottle?? Another member of my party waited a good 10 minutes for her naan to come out. They gave her twice the portion to make up for it, but she didn't need more...she just needed it to be ready with her warm dish when it first came out. I tried the naan too -- it was a bit thick and undercooked for my taste. It was also bland."
67,"8/6/16: Sorry, it's been too long since I ate here, and I've forgotten most of the details except my overall impression.  My friend talked it up before we got here, so I was expecting something pretty special and yummy, but to be honest, this food is extremely similar to Indian.  Of course, I'm not Indian so I'm sure they'd disagree, but for the rest of us, I doubt there's too huge of a difference.  For instance, they got nan's, though I guess the difference would be it's spelled ""nan"" instead of ""naan.""  But otherwise, tastes the same.  The curries taste the same too.  I think just about the only thing we tried that they don't have at Indian restaurants would be the dumplings.Anyway, this is what we had:1. Mango Lassi $3.502. Cono Sur Reisling $73. #2 Vegetable Pakora (5 Pieces) $4.95 ""mixed golden-fried vegetable fritters, served with mint sauce"":  Was okay. Like the fried vegetables at Indian buffets. 5/104. #9 Mixed Momo $10.95 ""momo sampler platter; 3 pieces of chicken, lamb and vegetable momo, served with tomato chutney""5. Nan of the month Badami Nan $3.95 ""stuffed cherry and nuts"":  Tastes like a PBJ sandwich. Really odd. Better suited for dessert. No one ate it after a bite. 3/106. Special #1 Baigain Bhartha $12.95 ""tandoor roasted eggplant, mashed and tempered with garlic and mustard seeds, then cooked with green peas in onion tomato based sauce"":  I remember this actually tasted pretty good, with a wonderfully tasty sauce. 7/107. #31 Himalayan Balti $15.95 ""assorted pieces of chicken breast, lamb cubes, shrimps, cauliflower, and potatoes cooked in house special sauce"":  Don't remember details except it wasn't that impressive. 5/108. Special #4 Lamb Kadai $14.95 with Garlic Nan $1.50 ""slow cooked boneless leg of lamb sauteed with onion and bell peppers then cooked with tomato and onion based gravy"":  Same deal. Tasted fine but nothing special. 5/103/5#himalayan #napalese #indian #naan #nan"
68,"Food was alright didn't really had taste to it everything tasted the same except the Chicken they were pretty good,Mango lassi tasted like over dose of yogurt no mango flavor Make sure to ask them for utensils when you order for delivery they do not even include napkins"
69,"One of the worst restaurant meals I've ever had. Dishwater broth, Naan was greasy and under cooked. The rest of the meal was poor in taste and portion.Service was rude and incompetent.This was a couple of years ago, perhaps they've improved but I won't know. Only blocks from home, but it was so bad I'll never go back."
70,One of my all time favorite restaurants. The food is fabulous the Naan is to die for and the service is friendly and fast and professional.
71,I've eaten here before and it was good. Recently I had a to-go order that took forever.I randomly (probably starvingly) wanted samosas. I called and ordered.They claimed it would be ready in 10mins. I arrived. Then I had to wait an additional 20 mins. Not fun at all. The samosas were ok. But I don't like waiting so I think I would hesitate to go back in fear of waiting an eternity.
72,"There isn't a glimmer of doubt in my mind that this is the finest Indian food I've tasted. These flavors jump boldly off the plate and unabashedly embrace the palette. Carefully developed balances of spice, savory, sweet, and sour seem to engage in some ancient dance to produce a dazzling and mystifying culinary experience. Combined with tasteful decor, excellent service, and a menu overflowing with vegan and vegetarian dishes, I eagerly anticipate my next visit to Taste of the Himalayas."
73,"I REALLY enjoy spicy Indian food and this restaurant got it right! The goat Biriyani was fantastic. The raita could have had more cucumber but was very good.I enjoyed the dall as well. One star off for the dryness of the rice.I will eat here more often and try other things. Their vegetarian menu looks fantastic, so I may eat here at least twice a monthBerkeley has a lot of Indian restaurants, but the great flavors here and the reasonable prices win my heart and wallet"
74,I have been to Taste of the Himalayas multiple times.  It has always been a very positive experience.  The people are courteous.  The food is VERY authentic and so delicious.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.My only criticism: I wish they were open for Sunday lunch. That way I can avoid the craziness of Berkeley traffic and parking.
75,I love Taste of the Himalayan restaurant. I basically tried momo and mango lassi they have and the service and staff are friendly.
76,"The food and service were great , quality of the food overall I would say is pretty goood especially after trying from various indian restaurants around I give this place a thumbs up ! Also With anything you order , you get a free lentil soup and rice with your order while you wait  , which was awesome and unexpected by me !"
77,Fabulous food. Highly highly recommend. The mixed momo is the way to go. Best Indian food in east bay.
78,"This is really my favorite indian food lately.  Some old standard indian places have let me down lately, but this is consistently good, and their lunch special is cool with a nice assortment of different things.  Just wish they included Palak Paneer as a choice.  Nice ambiance and drinks selection too- okay for a quick work lunch or for celebrating a nicer meal."
79,"Weeknight dinner. Chicken tikka masala (mild) with brown rice was delicious, as were the delicately buttered naan bread and the lentil soup. Comfortable atmosphere and amiable, welcoming, attentive, and helpful staff. Hope to return soon to try more dishes."

The lamb was still a bit uncooked. (I had stomach problem later in the day, not sure if related to this.) Quite a few of them also had broken skins.Samosa was dry and pretty bland. The garlic naan was good and probably the only decent dish of all.Chicken Tikka Masala had nice sauce but the chicken itself was pretty dry. Shrimp vindaloo was okay but there were only a few shrimps inside.The mango lassi had too much yoghort inside and I couldn't really taste the mango.Overall the serving portions were really small (except for the momos, which we couldn't even finish) and the taste was barely okay.This was probably one of the worst meals I've had this year. Definitely not coming back here."
122,"Got the Groupon for this restaurant and had lunch there recently. This restaurant is nicely situated next to some other cool shops and restaurants in Berkeley. I had high hopes for this restaurant delivering on some quality Indian and Nepalese cuisine.There was not a lot of flexibility on where we could sit, despite the near empty restaurant. We were steered towards a small table in the back and middle of the room. I think I was seated in the darkest part of the restaurant - highly recommend sitting closer to the windows with sunlight streaming in or center of the dining room.Service was delivered with a smile but was pretty slow. The mixed biryani was fairly bland. Samosas were just OK - needed more flavor and seemed to have used the bare minimum in spices. Don't be fooled by the value offered by the Groupon - unless this place can up the taste and flavor of its entrees, it's not worth spending your time or energy trying to dine here.UPDATED: After I posted this, Manny A. sent me the following note, labelled as a ""compliment""Manny A.San Francisco, CA 0 friends 4 reviews 4 photos Just a Note 5/18/2017For your review of: Taste of the Himalayas""Looks like your very sensitive person.i don't know your age but you sound like a lil cry baby""Wonder if the owner of the Taste of the Himalayas got upset and had his buddy bro send me this nastygram...lol. In any event, I guess the truth hurts, and my review upset someone. Sorry, next time do better."
123,"There is such a positive vibe in this place, from the friendly ""Namaste"" greeting to the beautiful decor.Service was fast and friendly, which is always a plus.We ordered the chicken tikka masala, shrimp korma, and garlic naan bread. All of which was season to perfect. Our meals were served with lentil soup, which was also very tasty."
124,"First time here, saw a deal on Groupon and bought it because of the reviews. We ordered on the phone since the Groupon was for take out ($20 for $10). 1. We ordered lamb tarkari and 2 garlic naans and this was about $25 before applying the Groupon. Along with our order, we got some kind of soup and a side of rice. I was really happy about the rice because I didn't expect it.2. I've had better lamb curries in my life. There were a lot of lamb chunks but they weren't tender. This lamb was slightly overcooked. The curry itself lacked spice. 3. The garlic naan was probably the highlight of our meal. I wish they didn't wrap it in foil because the naan became slightly soggy. 4. I wish they told us what kind of soup they gave us though. It was kind of squash-y and pea-y - couldn't really tell but it lacked flavor."
125,Momos mean dumplings and that's their specialty here. I like their lamb momos. It's lightly on the gamey side. Tikka masala is nicely creamy. Rice and naan was spot on.Calming decor vibes and service was friendly.
126,"(Preface: I absolutely love Indian food, having been spoiled by authentic and affordable cuisine in central Jersey.) So the lamb kadai was only alright: the sauce was pretty standard and the lamb was fattier than the lamb kadai I've had at other places. The portion was small but filling. I went with a party of 20 and I'm pretty sure most people's reactions were that the size was much smaller than expected. The momo's (dumplings) were quite nice and had strong tang of ginger in the filling, which I love, but may not be everyone's  cup of tea. Some issues that made me *almost* bump this review to 2 stars:I ordered a red wine, which was fine, but was dismayed to find the dregs at the bottom of the glass (see pictures). That should never, ever happen. I mean, would you serve your friends the dregs from the bottom of the bottle?? Another member of my party waited a good 10 minutes for her naan to come out. They gave her twice the portion to make up for it, but she didn't need more...she just needed it to be ready with her warm dish when it first came out. I tried the naan too -- it was a bit thick and undercooked for my taste. It was also bland."
127,"8/6/16: Sorry, it's been too long since I ate here, and I've forgotten most of the details except my overall impression.  My friend talked it up before we got here, so I was expecting something pretty special and yummy, but to be honest, this food is extremely similar to Indian.  Of course, I'm not Indian so I'm sure they'd disagree, but for the rest of us, I doubt there's too huge of a difference.  For instance, they got nan's, though I guess the difference would be it's spelled ""nan"" instead of ""naan.""  But otherwise, tastes the same.  The curries taste the same too.  I think just about the only thing we tried that they don't have at Indian restaurants would be the dumplings.Anyway, this is what we had:1. Mango Lassi $3.502. Cono Sur Reisling $73. #2 Vegetable Pakora (5 Pieces) $4.95 ""mixed golden-fried vegetable fritters, served with mint sauce"":  Was okay. Like the fried vegetables at Indian buffets. 5/104. #9 Mixed Momo $10.95 ""momo sampler platter; 3 pieces of chicken, lamb and vegetable momo, served with tomato chutney""5. Nan of the month Badami Nan $3.95 ""stuffed cherry and nuts"":  Tastes like a PBJ sandwich. Really odd. Better suited for dessert. No one ate it after a bite. 3/106. Special #1 Baigain Bhartha $12.95 ""tandoor roasted eggplant, mashed and tempered with garlic and mustard seeds, then cooked with green peas in onion tomato based sauce"":  I remember this actually tasted pretty good, with a wonderfully tasty sauce. 7/107. #31 Himalayan Balti $15.95 ""assorted pieces of chicken breast, lamb cubes, shrimps, cauliflower, and potatoes cooked in house special sauce"":  Don't remember details except it wasn't that impressive. 5/108. Special #4 Lamb Kadai $14.95 with Garlic Nan $1.50 ""slow cooked boneless leg of lamb sauteed with onion and bell peppers then cooked with tomato and onion based gravy"":  Same deal. Tasted fine but nothing special. 5/103/5#himalayan #napalese #indian #naan #nan"
128,"Food was alright didn't really had taste to it everything tasted the same except the Chicken they were pretty good,Mango lassi tasted like over dose of yogurt no mango flavor Make sure to ask them for utensils when you order for delivery they do not even include napkins"
129,"One of the worst restaurant meals I've ever had. Dishwater broth, Naan was greasy and under cooked. The rest of the meal was poor in taste and portion.Service was rude and incompetent.This was a couple of years ago, perhaps they've improved but I won't know. Only blocks from home, but it was so bad I'll never go back."
130,One of my all time favorite restaurants. The food is fabulous the Naan is to die for and the service is friendly and fast and professional.
131,I've eaten here before and it was good. Recently I had a to-go order that took forever.I randomly (probably starvingly) wanted samosas. I called and ordered.They claimed it would be ready in 10mins. I arrived. Then I had to wait an additional 20 mins. Not fun at all. The samosas were ok. But I don't like waiting so I think I would hesitate to go back in fear of waiting an eternity.
132,"There isn't a glimmer of doubt in my mind that this is the finest Indian food I've tasted. These flavors jump boldly off the plate and unabashedly embrace the palette. Carefully developed balances of spice, savory, sweet, and sour seem to engage in some ancient dance to produce a dazzling and mystifying culinary experience. Combined with tasteful decor, excellent service, and a menu overflowing with vegan and vegetarian dishes, I eagerly anticipate my next visit to Taste of the Himalayas."
133,"I REALLY enjoy spicy Indian food and this restaurant got it right! The goat Biriyani was fantastic. The raita could have had more cucumber but was very good.I enjoyed the dall as well. One star off for the dryness of the rice.I will eat here more often and try other things. Their vegetarian menu looks fantastic, so I may eat here at least twice a monthBerkeley has a lot of Indian restaurants, but the great flavors here and the reasonable prices win my heart and wallet"
134,I have been to Taste of the Himalayas multiple times.  It has always been a very positive experience.  The people are courteous.  The food is VERY authentic and so delicious.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.My only criticism: I wish they were open for Sunday lunch. That way I can avoid the craziness of Berkeley traffic and parking.
135,I love Taste of the Himalayan restaurant. I basically tried momo and mango lassi they have and the service and staff are friendly.
136,"The food and service were great , quality of the food overall I would say is pretty goood especially after trying from various indian restaurants around I give this place a thumbs up ! Also With anything you order , you get a free lentil soup and rice with your order while you wait  , which was awesome and unexpected by me !"
137,Fabulous food. Highly highly recommend. The mixed momo is the way to go. Best Indian food in east bay.
138,"This is really my favorite indian food lately.  Some old standard indian places have let me down lately, but this is consistently good, and their lunch special is cool with a nice assortment of different things.  Just wish they included Palak Paneer as a choice.  Nice ambiance and drinks selection too- okay for a quick work lunch or for celebrating a nicer meal."
139,"Weeknight dinner. Chicken tikka masala (mild) with brown rice was delicious, as were the delicately buttered naan bread and the lentil soup. Comfortable atmosphere and amiable, welcoming, attentive, and helpful staff. Hope to return soon to try more dishes."

181,"I was really disappointed with the restaurant especially knowing it has 4stars rating on Yelp.The momos was hardly comparable to the ones I've had in Hong Kong. The lamb was still a bit uncooked. (I had stomach problem later in the day, not sure if related to this.) Quite a few of them also had broken skins.Samosa was dry and pretty bland. The garlic naan was good and probably the only decent dish of all.Chicken Tikka Masala had nice sauce but the chicken itself was pretty dry. Shrimp vindaloo was okay but there were only a few shrimps inside.The mango lassi had too much yoghort inside and I couldn't really taste the mango.Overall the serving portions were really small (except for the momos, which we couldn't even finish) and the taste was barely okay.This was probably one of the worst meals I've had this year. Definitely not coming back here."
182,"Got the Groupon for this restaurant and had lunch there recently. This restaurant is nicely situated next to some other cool shops and restaurants in Berkeley. I had high hopes for this restaurant delivering on some quality Indian and Nepalese cuisine.There was not a lot of flexibility on where we could sit, despite the near empty restaurant. We were steered towards a small table in the back and middle of the room. I think I was seated in the darkest part of the restaurant - highly recommend sitting closer to the windows with sunlight streaming in or center of the dining room.Service was delivered with a smile but was pretty slow. The mixed biryani was fairly bland. Samosas were just OK - needed more flavor and seemed to have used the bare minimum in spices. Don't be fooled by the value offered by the Groupon - unless this place can up the taste and flavor of its entrees, it's not worth spending your time or energy trying to dine here.UPDATED: After I posted this, Manny A. sent me the following note, labelled as a ""compliment""Manny A.San Francisco, CA 0 friends 4 reviews 4 photos Just a Note 5/18/2017For your review of: Taste of the Himalayas""Looks like your very sensitive person.i don't know your age but you sound like a lil cry baby""Wonder if the owner of the Taste of the Himalayas got upset and had his buddy bro send me this nastygram...lol. In any event, I guess the truth hurts, and my review upset someone. Sorry, next time do better."
183,"There is such a positive vibe in this place, from the friendly ""Namaste"" greeting to the beautiful decor.Service was fast and friendly, which is always a plus.We ordered the chicken tikka masala, shrimp korma, and garlic naan bread. All of which was season to perfect. Our meals were served with lentil soup, which was also very tasty."
184,"First time here, saw a deal on Groupon and bought it because of the reviews. We ordered on the phone since the Groupon was for take out ($20 for $10). 1. We ordered lamb tarkari and 2 garlic naans and this was about $25 before applying the Groupon. Along with our order, we got some kind of soup and a side of rice. I was really happy about the rice because I didn't expect it.2. I've had better lamb curries in my life. There were a lot of lamb chunks but they weren't tender. This lamb was slightly overcooked. The curry itself lacked spice. 3. The garlic naan was probably the highlight of our meal. I wish they didn't wrap it in foil because the naan became slightly soggy. 4. I wish they told us what kind of soup they gave us though. It was kind of squash-y and pea-y - couldn't really tell but it lacked flavor."
185,Momos mean dumplings and that's their specialty here. I like their lamb momos. It's lightly on the gamey side. Tikka masala is nicely creamy. Rice and naan was spot on.Calming decor vibes and service was friendly.
186,"(Preface: I absolutely love Indian food, having been spoiled by authentic and affordable cuisine in central Jersey.) So the lamb kadai was only alright: the sauce was pretty standard and the lamb was fattier than the lamb kadai I've had at other places. The portion was small but filling. I went with a party of 20 and I'm pretty sure most people's reactions were that the size was much smaller than expected. The momo's (dumplings) were quite nice and had strong tang of ginger in the filling, which I love, but may not be everyone's  cup of tea. Some issues that made me *almost* bump this review to 2 stars:I ordered a red wine, which was fine, but was dismayed to find the dregs at the bottom of the glass (see pictures). That should never, ever happen. I mean, would you serve your friends the dregs from the bottom of the bottle?? Another member of my party waited a good 10 minutes for her naan to come out. They gave her twice the portion to make up for it, but she didn't need more...she just needed it to be ready with her warm dish when it first came out. I tried the naan too -- it was a bit thick and undercooked for my taste. It was also bland."
187,"8/6/16: Sorry, it's been too long since I ate here, and I've forgotten most of the details except my overall impression.  My friend talked it up before we got here, so I was expecting something pretty special and yummy, but to be honest, this food is extremely similar to Indian.  Of course, I'm not Indian so I'm sure they'd disagree, but for the rest of us, I doubt there's too huge of a difference.  For instance, they got nan's, though I guess the difference would be it's spelled ""nan"" instead of ""naan.""  But otherwise, tastes the same.  The curries taste the same too.  I think just about the only thing we tried that they don't have at Indian restaurants would be the dumplings.Anyway, this is what we had:1. Mango Lassi $3.502. Cono Sur Reisling $73. #2 Vegetable Pakora (5 Pieces) $4.95 ""mixed golden-fried vegetable fritters, served with mint sauce"":  Was okay. Like the fried vegetables at Indian buffets. 5/104. #9 Mixed Momo $10.95 ""momo sampler platter; 3 pieces of chicken, lamb and vegetable momo, served with tomato chutney""5. Nan of the month Badami Nan $3.95 ""stuffed cherry and nuts"":  Tastes like a PBJ sandwich. Really odd. Better suited for dessert. No one ate it after a bite. 3/106. Special #1 Baigain Bhartha $12.95 ""tandoor roasted eggplant, mashed and tempered with garlic and mustard seeds, then cooked with green peas in onion tomato based sauce"":  I remember this actually tasted pretty good, with a wonderfully tasty sauce. 7/107. #31 Himalayan Balti $15.95 ""assorted pieces of chicken breast, lamb cubes, shrimps, cauliflower, and potatoes cooked in house special sauce"":  Don't remember details except it wasn't that impressive. 5/108. Special #4 Lamb Kadai $14.95 with Garlic Nan $1.50 ""slow cooked boneless leg of lamb sauteed with onion and bell peppers then cooked with tomato and onion based gravy"":  Same deal. Tasted fine but nothing special. 5/103/5#himalayan #napalese #indian #naan #nan"
188,"Food was alright didn't really had taste to it everything tasted the same except the Chicken they were pretty good,Mango lassi tasted like over dose of yogurt no mango flavor Make sure to ask them for utensils when you order for delivery they do not even include napkins"
189,"One of the worst restaurant meals I've ever had. Dishwater broth, Naan was greasy and under cooked. The rest of the meal was poor in taste and portion.Service was rude and incompetent.This was a couple of years ago, perhaps they've improved but I won't know. Only blocks from home, but it was so bad I'll never go back."
190,One of my all time favorite restaurants. The food is fabulous the Naan is to die for and the service is friendly and fast and professional.
191,I've eaten here before and it was good. Recently I had a to-go order that took forever.I randomly (probably starvingly) wanted samosas. I called and ordered.They claimed it would be ready in 10mins. I arrived. Then I had to wait an additional 20 mins. Not fun at all. The samosas were ok. But I don't like waiting so I think I would hesitate to go back in fear of waiting an eternity.
192,"There isn't a glimmer of doubt in my mind that this is the finest Indian food I've tasted. These flavors jump boldly off the plate and unabashedly embrace the palette. Carefully developed balances of spice, savory, sweet, and sour seem to engage in some ancient dance to produce a dazzling and mystifying culinary experience. Combined with tasteful decor, excellent service, and a menu overflowing with vegan and vegetarian dishes, I eagerly anticipate my next visit to Taste of the Himalayas."
193,"I REALLY enjoy spicy Indian food and this restaurant got it right! The goat Biriyani was fantastic. The raita could have had more cucumber but was very good.I enjoyed the dall as well. One star off for the dryness of the rice.I will eat here more often and try other things. Their vegetarian menu looks fantastic, so I may eat here at least twice a monthBerkeley has a lot of Indian restaurants, but the great flavors here and the reasonable prices win my heart and wallet"
194,I have been to Taste of the Himalayas multiple times.  It has always been a very positive experience.  The people are courteous.  The food is VERY authentic and so delicious.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.My only criticism: I wish they were open for Sunday lunch. That way I can avoid the craziness of Berkeley traffic and parking.
195,I love Taste of the Himalayan restaurant. I basically tried momo and mango lassi they have and the service and staff are friendly.
196,"The food and service were great , quality of the food overall I would say is pretty goood especially after trying from various indian restaurants around I give this place a thumbs up ! Also With anything you order , you get a free lentil soup and rice with your order while you wait  , which was awesome and unexpected by me !"
197,Fabulous food. Highly highly recommend. The mixed momo is the way to go. Best Indian food in east bay.
198,"This is really my favorite indian food lately.  Some old standard indian places have let me down lately, but this is consistently good, and their lunch special is cool with a nice assortment of different things.  Just wish they included Palak Paneer as a choice.  Nice ambiance and drinks selection too- okay for a quick work lunch or for celebrating a nicer meal."

240,"Service was excellent. The staff was friendly & attentive.Chicken & veggie momos were tasty. Pretty large portion and filling.The ""aloo bhanta"" eggplant vegetarian dish was delicious.Naan was perfect. Will definitely return soon."
241,"I was really disappointed with the restaurant especially knowing it has 4stars rating on Yelp.The momos was hardly comparable to the ones I've had in Hong Kong. The lamb was still a bit uncooked. (I had stomach problem later in the day, not sure if related to this.) Quite a few of them also had broken skins.Samosa was dry and pretty bland. The garlic naan was good and probably the only decent dish of all.Chicken Tikka Masala had nice sauce but the chicken itself was pretty dry. Shrimp vindaloo was okay but there were only a few shrimps inside.The mango lassi had too much yoghort inside and I couldn't really taste the mango.Overall the serving portions were really small (except for the momos, which we couldn't even finish) and the taste was barely okay.This was probably one of the worst meals I've had this year. Definitely not coming back here."
242,"Got the Groupon for this restaurant and had lunch there recently. This restaurant is nicely situated next to some other cool shops and restaurants in Berkeley. I had high hopes for this restaurant delivering on some quality Indian and Nepalese cuisine.There was not a lot of flexibility on where we could sit, despite the near empty restaurant. We were steered towards a small table in the back and middle of the room. I think I was seated in the darkest part of the restaurant - highly recommend sitting closer to the windows with sunlight streaming in or center of the dining room.Service was delivered with a smile but was pretty slow. The mixed biryani was fairly bland. Samosas were just OK - needed more flavor and seemed to have used the bare minimum in spices. Don't be fooled by the value offered by the Groupon - unless this place can up the taste and flavor of its entrees, it's not worth spending your time or energy trying to dine here.UPDATED: After I posted this, Manny A. sent me the following note, labelled as a ""compliment""Manny A.San Francisco, CA 0 friends 4 reviews 4 photos Just a Note 5/18/2017For your review of: Taste of the Himalayas""Looks like your very sensitive person.i don't know your age but you sound like a lil cry baby""Wonder if the owner of the Taste of the Himalayas got upset and had his buddy bro send me this nastygram...lol. In any event, I guess the truth hurts, and my review upset someone. Sorry, next time do better."
243,"There is such a positive vibe in this place, from the friendly ""Namaste"" greeting to the beautiful decor.Service was fast and friendly, which is always a plus.We ordered the chicken tikka masala, shrimp korma, and garlic naan bread. All of which was season to perfect. Our meals were served with lentil soup, which was also very tasty."
244,"First time here, saw a deal on Groupon and bought it because of the reviews. We ordered on the phone since the Groupon was for take out ($20 for $10). 1. We ordered lamb tarkari and 2 garlic naans and this was about $25 before applying the Groupon. Along with our order, we got some kind of soup and a side of rice. I was really happy about the rice because I didn't expect it.2. I've had better lamb curries in my life. There were a lot of lamb chunks but they weren't tender. This lamb was slightly overcooked. The curry itself lacked spice. 3. The garlic naan was probably the highlight of our meal. I wish they didn't wrap it in foil because the naan became slightly soggy. 4. I wish they told us what kind of soup they gave us though. It was kind of squash-y and pea-y - couldn't really tell but it lacked flavor."
245,Momos mean dumplings and that's their specialty here. I like their lamb momos. It's lightly on the gamey side. Tikka masala is nicely creamy. Rice and naan was spot on.Calming decor vibes and service was friendly.
246,"(Preface: I absolutely love Indian food, having been spoiled by authentic and affordable cuisine in central Jersey.) So the lamb kadai was only alright: the sauce was pretty standard and the lamb was fattier than the lamb kadai I've had at other places. The portion was small but filling. I went with a party of 20 and I'm pretty sure most people's reactions were that the size was much smaller than expected. The momo's (dumplings) were quite nice and had strong tang of ginger in the filling, which I love, but may not be everyone's  cup of tea. Some issues that made me *almost* bump this review to 2 stars:I ordered a red wine, which was fine, but was dismayed to find the dregs at the bottom of the glass (see pictures). That should never, ever happen. I mean, would you serve your friends the dregs from the bottom of the bottle?? Another member of my party waited a good 10 minutes for her naan to come out. They gave her twice the portion to make up for it, but she didn't need more...she just needed it to be ready with her warm dish when it first came out. I tried the naan too -- it was a bit thick and undercooked for my taste. It was also bland."
247,"8/6/16: Sorry, it's been too long since I ate here, and I've forgotten most of the details except my overall impression.  My friend talked it up before we got here, so I was expecting something pretty special and yummy, but to be honest, this food is extremely similar to Indian.  Of course, I'm not Indian so I'm sure they'd disagree, but for the rest of us, I doubt there's too huge of a difference.  For instance, they got nan's, though I guess the difference would be it's spelled ""nan"" instead of ""naan.""  But otherwise, tastes the same.  The curries taste the same too.  I think just about the only thing we tried that they don't have at Indian restaurants would be the dumplings.Anyway, this is what we had:1. Mango Lassi $3.502. Cono Sur Reisling $73. #2 Vegetable Pakora (5 Pieces) $4.95 ""mixed golden-fried vegetable fritters, served with mint sauce"":  Was okay. Like the fried vegetables at Indian buffets. 5/104. #9 Mixed Momo $10.95 ""momo sampler platter; 3 pieces of chicken, lamb and vegetable momo, served with tomato chutney""5. Nan of the month Badami Nan $3.95 ""stuffed cherry and nuts"":  Tastes like a PBJ sandwich. Really odd. Better suited for dessert. No one ate it after a bite. 3/106. Special #1 Baigain Bhartha $12.95 ""tandoor roasted eggplant, mashed and tempered with garlic and mustard seeds, then cooked with green peas in onion tomato based sauce"":  I remember this actually tasted pretty good, with a wonderfully tasty sauce. 7/107. #31 Himalayan Balti $15.95 ""assorted pieces of chicken breast, lamb cubes, shrimps, cauliflower, and potatoes cooked in house special sauce"":  Don't remember details except it wasn't that impressive. 5/108. Special #4 Lamb Kadai $14.95 with Garlic Nan $1.50 ""slow cooked boneless leg of lamb sauteed with onion and bell peppers then cooked with tomato and onion based gravy"":  Same deal. Tasted fine but nothing special. 5/103/5#himalayan #napalese #indian #naan #nan"
248,"Food was alright didn't really had taste to it everything tasted the same except the Chicken they were pretty good,Mango lassi tasted like over dose of yogurt no mango flavor Make sure to ask them for utensils when you order for delivery they do not even include napkins"
249,"One of the worst restaurant meals I've ever had. Dishwater broth, Naan was greasy and under cooked. The rest of the meal was poor in taste and portion.Service was rude and incompetent.This was a couple of years ago, perhaps they've improved but I won't know. Only blocks from home, but it was so bad I'll never go back."
250,One of my all time favorite restaurants. The food is fabulous the Naan is to die for and the service is friendly and fast and professional.
251,I've eaten here before and it was good. Recently I had a to-go order that took forever.I randomly (probably starvingly) wanted samosas. I called and ordered.They claimed it would be ready in 10mins. I arrived. Then I had to wait an additional 20 mins. Not fun at all. The samosas were ok. But I don't like waiting so I think I would hesitate to go back in fear of waiting an eternity.
252,"There isn't a glimmer of doubt in my mind that this is the finest Indian food I've tasted. These flavors jump boldly off the plate and unabashedly embrace the palette. Carefully developed balances of spice, savory, sweet, and sour seem to engage in some ancient dance to produce a dazzling and mystifying culinary experience. Combined with tasteful decor, excellent service, and a menu overflowing with vegan and vegetarian dishes, I eagerly anticipate my next visit to Taste of the Himalayas."
253,"I REALLY enjoy spicy Indian food and this restaurant got it right! The goat Biriyani was fantastic. The raita could have had more cucumber but was very good.I enjoyed the dall as well. One star off for the dryness of the rice.I will eat here more often and try other things. Their vegetarian menu looks fantastic, so I may eat here at least twice a monthBerkeley has a lot of Indian restaurants, but the great flavors here and the reasonable prices win my heart and wallet"
254,I have been to Taste of the Himalayas multiple times.  It has always been a very positive experience.  The people are courteous.  The food is VERY authentic and so delicious.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.My only criticism: I wish they were open for Sunday lunch. That way I can avoid the craziness of Berkeley traffic and parking.
255,I love Taste of the Himalayan restaurant. I basically tried momo and mango lassi they have and the service and staff are friendly.
256,"The food and service were great , quality of the food overall I would say is pretty goood especially after trying from various indian restaurants around I give this place a thumbs up ! Also With anything you order , you get a free lentil soup and rice with your order while you wait  , which was awesome and unexpected by me !"

298,"This is really my favorite indian food lately.  Some old standard indian places have let me down lately, but this is consistently good, and their lunch special is cool with a nice assortment of different things.  Just wish they included Palak Paneer as a choice.  Nice ambiance and drinks selection too- okay for a quick work lunch or for celebrating a nicer meal."
299,"Weeknight dinner. Chicken tikka masala (mild) with brown rice was delicious, as were the delicately buttered naan bread and the lentil soup. Comfortable atmosphere and amiable, welcoming, attentive, and helpful staff. Hope to return soon to try more dishes."
300,"Service was excellent. The staff was friendly & attentive.Chicken & veggie momos were tasty. Pretty large portion and filling.The ""aloo bhanta"" eggplant vegetarian dish was delicious.Naan was perfect. Will definitely return soon."
301,"I was really disappointed with the restaurant especially knowing it has 4stars rating on Yelp.The momos was hardly comparable to the ones I've had in Hong Kong. The lamb was still a bit uncooked. (I had stomach problem later in the day, not sure if related to this.) Quite a few of them also had broken skins.Samosa was dry and pretty bland. The garlic naan was good and probably the only decent dish of all.Chicken Tikka Masala had nice sauce but the chicken itself was pretty dry. Shrimp vindaloo was okay but there were only a few shrimps inside.The mango lassi had too much yoghort inside and I couldn't really taste the mango.Overall the serving portions were really small (except for the momos, which we couldn't even finish) and the taste was barely okay.This was probably one of the worst meals I've had this year. Definitely not coming back here."
302,"Got the Groupon for this restaurant and had lunch there recently. This restaurant is nicely situated next to some other cool shops and restaurants in Berkeley. I had high hopes for this restaurant delivering on some quality Indian and Nepalese cuisine.There was not a lot of flexibility on where we could sit, despite the near empty restaurant. We were steered towards a small table in the back and middle of the room. I think I was seated in the darkest part of the restaurant - highly recommend sitting closer to the windows with sunlight streaming in or center of the dining room.Service was delivered with a smile but was pretty slow. The mixed biryani was fairly bland. Samosas were just OK - needed more flavor and seemed to have used the bare minimum in spices. Don't be fooled by the value offered by the Groupon - unless this place can up the taste and flavor of its entrees, it's not worth spending your time or energy trying to dine here.UPDATED: After I posted this, Manny A. sent me the following note, labelled as a ""compliment""Manny A.San Francisco, CA 0 friends 4 reviews 4 photos Just a Note 5/18/2017For your review of: Taste of the Himalayas""Looks like your very sensitive person.i don't know your age but you sound like a lil cry baby""Wonder if the owner of the Taste of the Himalayas got upset and had his buddy bro send me this nastygram...lol. In any event, I guess the truth hurts, and my review upset someone. Sorry, next time do better."
303,"There is such a positive vibe in this place, from the friendly ""Namaste"" greeting to the beautiful decor.Service was fast and friendly, which is always a plus.We ordered the chicken tikka masala, shrimp korma, and garlic naan bread. All of which was season to perfect. Our meals were served with lentil soup, which was also very tasty."
304,"First time here, saw a deal on Groupon and bought it because of the reviews. We ordered on the phone since the Groupon was for take out ($20 for $10). 1. We ordered lamb tarkari and 2 garlic naans and this was about $25 before applying the Groupon. Along with our order, we got some kind of soup and a side of rice. I was really happy about the rice because I didn't expect it.2. I've had better lamb curries in my life. There were a lot of lamb chunks but they weren't tender. This lamb was slightly overcooked. The curry itself lacked spice. 3. The garlic naan was probably the highlight of our meal. I wish they didn't wrap it in foil because the naan became slightly soggy. 4. I wish they told us what kind of soup they gave us though. It was kind of squash-y and pea-y - couldn't really tell but it lacked flavor."
305,Momos mean dumplings and that's their specialty here. I like their lamb momos. It's lightly on the gamey side. Tikka masala is nicely creamy. Rice and naan was spot on.Calming decor vibes and service was friendly.
306,"(Preface: I absolutely love Indian food, having been spoiled by authentic and affordable cuisine in central Jersey.) So the lamb kadai was only alright: the sauce was pretty standard and the lamb was fattier than the lamb kadai I've had at other places. The portion was small but filling. I went with a party of 20 and I'm pretty sure most people's reactions were that the size was much smaller than expected. The momo's (dumplings) were quite nice and had strong tang of ginger in the filling, which I love, but may not be everyone's  cup of tea. Some issues that made me *almost* bump this review to 2 stars:I ordered a red wine, which was fine, but was dismayed to find the dregs at the bottom of the glass (see pictures). That should never, ever happen. I mean, would you serve your friends the dregs from the bottom of the bottle?? Another member of my party waited a good 10 minutes for her naan to come out. They gave her twice the portion to make up for it, but she didn't need more...she just needed it to be ready with her warm dish when it first came out. I tried the naan too -- it was a bit thick and undercooked for my taste. It was also bland."
307,"8/6/16: Sorry, it's been too long since I ate here, and I've forgotten most of the details except my overall impression.  My friend talked it up before we got here, so I was expecting something pretty special and yummy, but to be honest, this food is extremely similar to Indian.  Of course, I'm not Indian so I'm sure they'd disagree, but for the rest of us, I doubt there's too huge of a difference.  For instance, they got nan's, though I guess the difference would be it's spelled ""nan"" instead of ""naan.""  But otherwise, tastes the same.  The curries taste the same too.  I think just about the only thing we tried that they don't have at Indian restaurants would be the dumplings.Anyway, this is what we had:1. Mango Lassi $3.502. Cono Sur Reisling $73. #2 Vegetable Pakora (5 Pieces) $4.95 ""mixed golden-fried vegetable fritters, served with mint sauce"":  Was okay. Like the fried vegetables at Indian buffets. 5/104. #9 Mixed Momo $10.95 ""momo sampler platter; 3 pieces of chicken, lamb and vegetable momo, served with tomato chutney""5. Nan of the month Badami Nan $3.95 ""stuffed cherry and nuts"":  Tastes like a PBJ sandwich. Really odd. Better suited for dessert. No one ate it after a bite. 3/106. Special #1 Baigain Bhartha $12.95 ""tandoor roasted eggplant, mashed and tempered with garlic and mustard seeds, then cooked with green peas in onion tomato based sauce"":  I remember this actually tasted pretty good, with a wonderfully tasty sauce. 7/107. #31 Himalayan Balti $15.95 ""assorted pieces of chicken breast, lamb cubes, shrimps, cauliflower, and potatoes cooked in house special sauce"":  Don't remember details except it wasn't that impressive. 5/108. Special #4 Lamb Kadai $14.95 with Garlic Nan $1.50 ""slow cooked boneless leg of lamb sauteed with onion and bell peppers then cooked with tomato and onion based gravy"":  Same deal. Tasted fine but nothing special. 5/103/5#himalayan #napalese #indian #naan #nan"
308,"Food was alright didn't really had taste to it everything tasted the same except the Chicken they were pretty good,Mango lassi tasted like over dose of yogurt no mango flavor Make sure to ask them for utensils when you order for delivery they do not even include napkins"
309,"One of the worst restaurant meals I've ever had. Dishwater broth, Naan was greasy and under cooked. The rest of the meal was poor in taste and portion.Service was rude and incompetent.This was a couple of years ago, perhaps they've improved but I won't know. Only blocks from home, but it was so bad I'll never go back."
310,One of my all time favorite restaurants. The food is fabulous the Naan is to die for and the service is friendly and fast and professional.
311,I've eaten here before and it was good. Recently I had a to-go order that took forever.I randomly (probably starvingly) wanted samosas. I called and ordered.They claimed it would be ready in 10mins. I arrived. Then I had to wait an additional 20 mins. Not fun at all. The samosas were ok. But I don't like waiting so I think I would hesitate to go back in fear of waiting an eternity.
312,"There isn't a glimmer of doubt in my mind that this is the finest Indian food I've tasted. These flavors jump boldly off the plate and unabashedly embrace the palette. Carefully developed balances of spice, savory, sweet, and sour seem to engage in some ancient dance to produce a dazzling and mystifying culinary experience. Combined with tasteful decor, excellent service, and a menu overflowing with vegan and vegetarian dishes, I eagerly anticipate my next visit to Taste of the Himalayas."
313,"I REALLY enjoy spicy Indian food and this restaurant got it right! The goat Biriyani was fantastic. The raita could have had more cucumber but was very good.I enjoyed the dall as well. One star off for the dryness of the rice.I will eat here more often and try other things. Their vegetarian menu looks fantastic, so I may eat here at least twice a monthBerkeley has a lot of Indian restaurants, but the great flavors here and the reasonable prices win my heart and wallet"
314,I have been to Taste of the Himalayas multiple times.  It has always been a very positive experience.  The people are courteous.  The food is VERY authentic and so delicious.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.My only criticism: I wish they were open for Sunday lunch. That way I can avoid the craziness of Berkeley traffic and parking.
315,I love Taste of the Himalayan restaurant. I basically tried momo and mango lassi they have and the service and staff are friendly.
316,"The food and service were great , quality of the food overall I would say is pretty goood especially after trying from various indian restaurants around I give this place a thumbs up !

358,"This is really my favorite indian food lately.  Some old standard indian places have let me down lately, but this is consistently good, and their lunch special is cool with a nice assortment of different things.  Just wish they included Palak Paneer as a choice.  Nice ambiance and drinks selection too- okay for a quick work lunch or for celebrating a nicer meal."
359,"Weeknight dinner. Chicken tikka masala (mild) with brown rice was delicious, as were the delicately buttered naan bread and the lentil soup. Comfortable atmosphere and amiable, welcoming, attentive, and helpful staff. Hope to return soon to try more dishes."
360,"Service was excellent. The staff was friendly & attentive.Chicken & veggie momos were tasty. Pretty large portion and filling.The ""aloo bhanta"" eggplant vegetarian dish was delicious.Naan was perfect. Will definitely return soon."
361,"I was really disappointed with the restaurant especially knowing it has 4stars rating on Yelp.The momos was hardly comparable to the ones I've had in Hong Kong. The lamb was still a bit uncooked. (I had stomach problem later in the day, not sure if related to this.) Quite a few of them also had broken skins.Samosa was dry and pretty bland. The garlic naan was good and probably the only decent dish of all.Chicken Tikka Masala had nice sauce but the chicken itself was pretty dry. Shrimp vindaloo was okay but there were only a few shrimps inside.The mango lassi had too much yoghort inside and I couldn't really taste the mango.Overall the serving portions were really small (except for the momos, which we couldn't even finish) and the taste was barely okay.This was probably one of the worst meals I've had this year. Definitely not coming back here."
362,"Got the Groupon for this restaurant and had lunch there recently. This restaurant is nicely situated next to some other cool shops and restaurants in Berkeley. I had high hopes for this restaurant delivering on some quality Indian and Nepalese cuisine.There was not a lot of flexibility on where we could sit, despite the near empty restaurant. We were steered towards a small table in the back and middle of the room. I think I was seated in the darkest part of the restaurant - highly recommend sitting closer to the windows with sunlight streaming in or center of the dining room.Service was delivered with a smile but was pretty slow. The mixed biryani was fairly bland. Samosas were just OK - needed more flavor and seemed to have used the bare minimum in spices. Don't be fooled by the value offered by the Groupon - unless this place can up the taste and flavor of its entrees, it's not worth spending your time or energy trying to dine here.UPDATED: After I posted this, Manny A. sent me the following note, labelled as a ""compliment""Manny A.San Francisco, CA 0 friends 4 reviews 4 photos Just a Note 5/18/2017For your review of: Taste of the Himalayas""Looks like your very sensitive person.i don't know your age but you sound like a lil cry baby""Wonder if the owner of the Taste of the Himalayas got upset and had his buddy bro send me this nastygram...lol. In any event, I guess the truth hurts, and my review upset someone. Sorry, next time do better."
363,"There is such a positive vibe in this place, from the friendly ""Namaste"" greeting to the beautiful decor.Service was fast and friendly, which is always a plus.We ordered the chicken tikka masala, shrimp korma, and garlic naan bread. All of which was season to perfect. Our meals were served with lentil soup, which was also very tasty."
364,"First time here, saw a deal on Groupon and bought it because of the reviews. We ordered on the phone since the Groupon was for take out ($20 for $10). 1. We ordered lamb tarkari and 2 garlic naans and this was about $25 before applying the Groupon. Along with our order, we got some kind of soup and a side of rice. I was really happy about the rice because I didn't expect it.2. I've had better lamb curries in my life. There were a lot of lamb chunks but they weren't tender. This lamb was slightly overcooked. The curry itself lacked spice. 3. The garlic naan was probably the highlight of our meal. I wish they didn't wrap it in foil because the naan became slightly soggy. 4. I wish they told us what kind of soup they gave us though. It was kind of squash-y and pea-y - couldn't really tell but it lacked flavor."
365,Momos mean dumplings and that's their specialty here. I like their lamb momos. It's lightly on the gamey side. Tikka masala is nicely creamy. Rice and naan was spot on.Calming decor vibes and service was friendly.
366,"(Preface: I absolutely love Indian food, having been spoiled by authentic and affordable cuisine in central Jersey.) So the lamb kadai was only alright: the sauce was pretty standard and the lamb was fattier than the lamb kadai I've had at other places. The portion was small but filling. I went with a party of 20 and I'm pretty sure most people's reactions were that the size was much smaller than expected. The momo's (dumplings) were quite nice and had strong tang of ginger in the filling, which I love, but may not be everyone's  cup of tea. Some issues that made me *almost* bump this review to 2 stars:I ordered a red wine, which was fine, but was dismayed to find the dregs at the bottom of the glass (see pictures). That should never, ever happen. I mean, would you serve your friends the dregs from the bottom of the bottle?? Another member of my party waited a good 10 minutes for her naan to come out. They gave her twice the portion to make up for it, but she didn't need more...she just needed it to be ready with her warm dish when it first came out. I tried the naan too -- it was a bit thick and undercooked for my taste. It was also bland."
367,"8/6/16: Sorry, it's been too long since I ate here, and I've forgotten most of the details except my overall impression.  My friend talked it up before we got here, so I was expecting something pretty special and yummy, but to be honest, this food is extremely similar to Indian.  Of course, I'm not Indian so I'm sure they'd disagree, but for the rest of us, I doubt there's too huge of a difference.  For instance, they got nan's, though I guess the difference would be it's spelled ""nan"" instead of ""naan.""  But otherwise, tastes the same.  The curries taste the same too.  I think just about the only thing we tried that they don't have at Indian restaurants would be the dumplings.Anyway, this is what we had:1. Mango Lassi $3.502. Cono Sur Reisling $73. #2 Vegetable Pakora (5 Pieces) $4.95 ""mixed golden-fried vegetable fritters, served with mint sauce"":  Was okay. Like the fried vegetables at Indian buffets. 5/104. #9 Mixed Momo $10.95 ""momo sampler platter; 3 pieces of chicken, lamb and vegetable momo, served with tomato chutney""5. Nan of the month Badami Nan $3.95 ""stuffed cherry and nuts"":  Tastes like a PBJ sandwich. Really odd. Better suited for dessert. No one ate it after a bite. 3/106. Special #1 Baigain Bhartha $12.95 ""tandoor roasted eggplant, mashed and tempered with garlic and mustard seeds, then cooked with green peas in onion tomato based sauce"":  I remember this actually tasted pretty good, with a wonderfully tasty sauce. 7/107. #31 Himalayan Balti $15.95 ""assorted pieces of chicken breast, lamb cubes, shrimps, cauliflower, and potatoes cooked in house special sauce"":  Don't remember details except it wasn't that impressive. 5/108. Special #4 Lamb Kadai $14.95 with Garlic Nan $1.50 ""slow cooked boneless leg of lamb sauteed with onion and bell peppers then cooked with tomato and onion based gravy"":  Same deal. Tasted fine but nothing special. 5/103/5#himalayan #napalese #indian #naan #nan"
368,"Food was alright didn't really had taste to it everything tasted the same except the Chicken they were pretty good,Mango lassi tasted like over dose of yogurt no mango flavor Make sure to ask them for utensils when you order for delivery they do not even include napkins"
369,"One of the worst restaurant meals I've ever had. Dishwater broth, Naan was greasy and under cooked. The rest of the meal was poor in taste and portion.Service was rude and incompetent.This was a couple of years ago, perhaps they've improved but I won't know. Only blocks from home, but it was so bad I'll never go back."
370,One of my all time favorite restaurants. The food is fabulous the Naan is to die for and the service is friendly and fast and professional.
371,I've eaten here before and it was good. Recently I had a to-go order that took forever.I randomly (probably starvingly) wanted samosas. I called and ordered.They claimed it would be ready in 10mins. I arrived. Then I had to wait an additional 20 mins. Not fun at all. The samosas were ok. But I don't like waiting so I think I would hesitate to go back in fear of waiting an eternity.
372,"There isn't a glimmer of doubt in my mind that this is the finest Indian food I've tasted. These flavors jump boldly off the plate and unabashedly embrace the palette. Carefully developed balances of spice, savory, sweet, and sour seem to engage in some ancient dance to produce a dazzling and mystifying culinary experience. Combined with tasteful decor, excellent service, and a menu overflowing with vegan and vegetarian dishes, I eagerly anticipate my next visit to Taste of the Himalayas."
373,"I REALLY enjoy spicy Indian food and this restaurant got it right! The goat Biriyani was fantastic. The raita could have had more cucumber but was very good.I enjoyed the dall as well. One star off for the dryness of the rice.I will eat here more often and try other things. Their vegetarian menu looks fantastic, so I may eat here at least twice a monthBerkeley has a lot of Indian restaurants, but the great flavors here and the reasonable prices win my heart and wallet"
374,I have been to Taste of the Himalayas multiple times.  It has always been a very positive experience.  The people are courteous.  The food is VERY authentic and so delicious.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.My only criticism: I wish they were open for Sunday lunch. That way I can avoid the craziness of Berkeley traffic and parking.
375,I love Taste of the Himalayan restaurant. I basically tried momo and mango lassi they have and the service and staff are friendly.
376,"The food and service were great , quality of the food overall I would say is pretty goood especially after trying from various indian restaurants around I give this place a thumbs up !

418,"This is really my favorite indian food lately.  Some old standard indian places have let me down lately, but this is consistently good, and their lunch special is cool with a nice assortment of different things.  Just wish they included Palak Paneer as a choice.  Nice ambiance and drinks selection too- okay for a quick work lunch or for celebrating a nicer meal."
419,"Weeknight dinner. Chicken tikka masala (mild) with brown rice was delicious, as were the delicately buttered naan bread and the lentil soup. Comfortable atmosphere and amiable, welcoming, attentive, and helpful staff. Hope to return soon to try more dishes."
420,"Service was excellent. The staff was friendly & attentive.Chicken & veggie momos were tasty. Pretty large portion and filling.The ""aloo bhanta"" eggplant vegetarian dish was delicious.Naan was perfect. Will definitely return soon."
421,"I was really disappointed with the restaurant especially knowing it has 4stars rating on Yelp.The momos was hardly comparable to the ones I've had in Hong Kong. The lamb was still a bit uncooked. (I had stomach problem later in the day, not sure if related to this.) Quite a few of them also had broken skins.Samosa was dry and pretty bland. The garlic naan was good and probably the only decent dish of all.Chicken Tikka Masala had nice sauce but the chicken itself was pretty dry. Shrimp vindaloo was okay but there were only a few shrimps inside.The mango lassi had too much yoghort inside and I couldn't really taste the mango.Overall the serving portions were really small (except for the momos, which we couldn't even finish) and the taste was barely okay.This was probably one of the worst meals I've had this year. Definitely not coming back here."
422,"Got the Groupon for this restaurant and had lunch there recently. This restaurant is nicely situated next to some other cool shops and restaurants in Berkeley. I had high hopes for this restaurant delivering on some quality Indian and Nepalese cuisine.There was not a lot of flexibility on where we could sit, despite the near empty restaurant. We were steered towards a small table in the back and middle of the room. I think I was seated in the darkest part of the restaurant - highly recommend sitting closer to the windows with sunlight streaming in or center of the dining room.Service was delivered with a smile but was pretty slow. The mixed biryani was fairly bland. Samosas were just OK - needed more flavor and seemed to have used the bare minimum in spices. Don't be fooled by the value offered by the Groupon - unless this place can up the taste and flavor of its entrees, it's not worth spending your time or energy trying to dine here.UPDATED: After I posted this, Manny A. sent me the following note, labelled as a ""compliment""Manny A.San Francisco, CA 0 friends 4 reviews 4 photos Just a Note 5/18/2017For your review of: Taste of the Himalayas""Looks like your very sensitive person.i don't know your age but you sound like a lil cry baby""Wonder if the owner of the Taste of the Himalayas got upset and had his buddy bro send me this nastygram...lol. In any event, I guess the truth hurts, and my review upset someone. Sorry, next time do better."
423,"There is such a positive vibe in this place, from the friendly ""Namaste"" greeting to the beautiful decor.Service was fast and friendly, which is always a plus.We ordered the chicken tikka masala, shrimp korma, and garlic naan bread. All of which was season to perfect. Our meals were served with lentil soup, which was also very tasty."
424,"First time here, saw a deal on Groupon and bought it because of the reviews. We ordered on the phone since the Groupon was for take out ($20 for $10). 1. We ordered lamb tarkari and 2 garlic naans and this was about $25 before applying the Groupon. Along with our order, we got some kind of soup and a side of rice. I was really happy about the rice because I didn't expect it.2. I've had better lamb curries in my life. There were a lot of lamb chunks but they weren't tender. This lamb was slightly overcooked. The curry itself lacked spice. 3. The garlic naan was probably the highlight of our meal. I wish they didn't wrap it in foil because the naan became slightly soggy. 4. I wish they told us what kind of soup they gave us though. It was kind of squash-y and pea-y - couldn't really tell but it lacked flavor."
425,Momos mean dumplings and that's their specialty here. I like their lamb momos. It's lightly on the gamey side. Tikka masala is nicely creamy. Rice and naan was spot on.Calming decor vibes and service was friendly.
426,"(Preface: I absolutely love Indian food, having been spoiled by authentic and affordable cuisine in central Jersey.) So the lamb kadai was only alright: the sauce was pretty standard and the lamb was fattier than the lamb kadai I've had at other places. The portion was small but filling. I went with a party of 20 and I'm pretty sure most people's reactions were that the size was much smaller than expected. The momo's (dumplings) were quite nice and had strong tang of ginger in the filling, which I love, but may not be everyone's  cup of tea. Some issues that made me *almost* bump this review to 2 stars:I ordered a red wine, which was fine, but was dismayed to find the dregs at the bottom of the glass (see pictures). That should never, ever happen. I mean, would you serve your friends the dregs from the bottom of the bottle?? Another member of my party waited a good 10 minutes for her naan to come out. They gave her twice the portion to make up for it, but she didn't need more...she just needed it to be ready with her warm dish when it first came out. I tried the naan too -- it was a bit thick and undercooked for my taste. It was also bland."
427,"8/6/16: Sorry, it's been too long since I ate here, and I've forgotten most of the details except my overall impression.  My friend talked it up before we got here, so I was expecting something pretty special and yummy, but to be honest, this food is extremely similar to Indian.  Of course, I'm not Indian so I'm sure they'd disagree, but for the rest of us, I doubt there's too huge of a difference.  For instance, they got nan's, though I guess the difference would be it's spelled ""nan"" instead of ""naan.""  But otherwise, tastes the same.  The curries taste the same too.  I think just about the only thing we tried that they don't have at Indian restaurants would be the dumplings.Anyway, this is what we had:1. Mango Lassi $3.502. Cono Sur Reisling $73. #2 Vegetable Pakora (5 Pieces) $4.95 ""mixed golden-fried vegetable fritters, served with mint sauce"":  Was okay. Like the fried vegetables at Indian buffets. 5/104. #9 Mixed Momo $10.95 ""momo sampler platter; 3 pieces of chicken, lamb and vegetable momo, served with tomato chutney""5. Nan of the month Badami Nan $3.95 ""stuffed cherry and nuts"":  Tastes like a PBJ sandwich. Really odd. Better suited for dessert. No one ate it after a bite. 3/106. Special #1 Baigain Bhartha $12.95 ""tandoor roasted eggplant, mashed and tempered with garlic and mustard seeds, then cooked with green peas in onion tomato based sauce"":  I remember this actually tasted pretty good, with a wonderfully tasty sauce. 7/107. #31 Himalayan Balti $15.95 ""assorted pieces of chicken breast, lamb cubes, shrimps, cauliflower, and potatoes cooked in house special sauce"":  Don't remember details except it wasn't that impressive. 5/108. Special #4 Lamb Kadai $14.95 with Garlic Nan $1.50 ""slow cooked boneless leg of lamb sauteed with onion and bell peppers then cooked with tomato and onion based gravy"":  Same deal. Tasted fine but nothing special. 5/103/5#himalayan #napalese #indian #naan #nan"
428,"Food was alright didn't really had taste to it everything tasted the same except the Chicken they were pretty good,Mango lassi tasted like over dose of yogurt no mango flavor Make sure to ask them for utensils when you order for delivery they do not even include napkins"
429,"One of the worst restaurant meals I've ever had. Dishwater broth, Naan was greasy and under cooked. The rest of the meal was poor in taste and portion.Service was rude and incompetent.This was a couple of years ago, perhaps they've improved but I won't know. Only blocks from home, but it was so bad I'll never go back."
430,One of my all time favorite restaurants. The food is fabulous the Naan is to die for and the service is friendly and fast and professional.
431,I've eaten here before and it was good. Recently I had a to-go order that took forever.I randomly (probably starvingly) wanted samosas. I called and ordered.They claimed it would be ready in 10mins. I arrived. Then I had to wait an additional 20 mins. Not fun at all. The samosas were ok. But I don't like waiting so I think I would hesitate to go back in fear of waiting an eternity.
432,"There isn't a glimmer of doubt in my mind that this is the finest Indian food I've tasted. These flavors jump boldly off the plate and unabashedly embrace the palette. Carefully developed balances of spice, savory, sweet, and sour seem to engage in some ancient dance to produce a dazzling and mystifying culinary experience. Combined with tasteful decor, excellent service, and a menu overflowing with vegan and vegetarian dishes, I eagerly anticipate my next visit to Taste of the Himalayas."
433,"I REALLY enjoy spicy Indian food and this restaurant got it right! The goat Biriyani was fantastic. The raita could have had more cucumber but was very good.I enjoyed the dall as well. One star off for the dryness of the rice.I will eat here more often and try other things. Their vegetarian menu looks fantastic, so I may eat here at least twice a monthBerkeley has a lot of Indian restaurants, but the great flavors here and the reasonable prices win my heart and wallet"
434,I have been to Taste of the Himalayas multiple times.  It has always been a very positive experience.  The people are courteous.  The food is VERY authentic and so delicious.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.My only criticism: I wish they were open for Sunday lunch. That way I can avoid the craziness of Berkeley traffic and parking.
435,I love Taste of the Himalayan restaurant. I basically tried momo and mango lassi they have and the service and staff are friendly.
436,"The food and service were great , quality of the food overall I would say is pretty goood especially after trying from various indian restaurants around I give this place a thumbs up !

478,"This is really my favorite indian food lately.  Some old standard indian places have let me down lately, but this is consistently good, and their lunch special is cool with a nice assortment of different things.  Just wish they included Palak Paneer as a choice.  Nice ambiance and drinks selection too- okay for a quick work lunch or for celebrating a nicer meal."
479,"Weeknight dinner. Chicken tikka masala (mild) with brown rice was delicious, as were the delicately buttered naan bread and the lentil soup. Comfortable atmosphere and amiable, welcoming, attentive, and helpful staff. Hope to return soon to try more dishes."
480,"Service was excellent. The staff was friendly & attentive.Chicken & veggie momos were tasty. Pretty large portion and filling.The ""aloo bhanta"" eggplant vegetarian dish was delicious.Naan was perfect. Will definitely return soon."
481,"I was really disappointed with the restaurant especially knowing it has 4stars rating on Yelp.The momos was hardly comparable to the ones I've had in Hong Kong. The lamb was still a bit uncooked. (I had stomach problem later in the day, not sure if related to this.) Quite a few of them also had broken skins.Samosa was dry and pretty bland. The garlic naan was good and probably the only decent dish of all.Chicken Tikka Masala had nice sauce but the chicken itself was pretty dry. Shrimp vindaloo was okay but there were only a few shrimps inside.The mango lassi had too much yoghort inside and I couldn't really taste the mango.Overall the serving portions were really small (except for the momos, which we couldn't even finish) and the taste was barely okay.This was probably one of the worst meals I've had this year. Definitely not coming back here."
482,"Got the Groupon for this restaurant and had lunch there recently. This restaurant is nicely situated next to some other cool shops and restaurants in Berkeley. I had high hopes for this restaurant delivering on some quality Indian and Nepalese cuisine.There was not a lot of flexibility on where we could sit, despite the near empty restaurant. We were steered towards a small table in the back and middle of the room. I think I was seated in the darkest part of the restaurant - highly recommend sitting closer to the windows with sunlight streaming in or center of the dining room.Service was delivered with a smile but was pretty slow. The mixed biryani was fairly bland. Samosas were just OK - needed more flavor and seemed to have used the bare minimum in spices. Don't be fooled by the value offered by the Groupon - unless this place can up the taste and flavor of its entrees, it's not worth spending your time or energy trying to dine here.UPDATED: After I posted this, Manny A. sent me the following note, labelled as a ""compliment""Manny A.San Francisco, CA 0 friends 4 reviews 4 photos Just a Note 5/18/2017For your review of: Taste of the Himalayas""Looks like your very sensitive person.i don't know your age but you sound like a lil cry baby""Wonder if the owner of the Taste of the Himalayas got upset and had his buddy bro send me this nastygram...lol. In any event, I guess the truth hurts, and my review upset someone. Sorry, next time do better."
483,"There is such a positive vibe in this place, from the friendly ""Namaste"" greeting to the beautiful decor.Service was fast and friendly, which is always a plus.We ordered the chicken tikka masala, shrimp korma, and garlic naan bread. All of which was season to perfect. Our meals were served with lentil soup, which was also very tasty."
484,"First time here, saw a deal on Groupon and bought it because of the reviews. We ordered on the phone since the Groupon was for take out ($20 for $10). 1. We ordered lamb tarkari and 2 garlic naans and this was about $25 before applying the Groupon. Along with our order, we got some kind of soup and a side of rice. I was really happy about the rice because I didn't expect it.2. I've had better lamb curries in my life. There were a lot of lamb chunks but they weren't tender. This lamb was slightly overcooked. The curry itself lacked spice. 3. The garlic naan was probably the highlight of our meal. I wish they didn't wrap it in foil because the naan became slightly soggy. 4. I wish they told us what kind of soup they gave us though. It was kind of squash-y and pea-y - couldn't really tell but it lacked flavor."
485,Momos mean dumplings and that's their specialty here. I like their lamb momos. It's lightly on the gamey side. Tikka masala is nicely creamy. Rice and naan was spot on.Calming decor vibes and service was friendly.
486,"(Preface: I absolutely love Indian food, having been spoiled by authentic and affordable cuisine in central Jersey.) So the lamb kadai was only alright: the sauce was pretty standard and the lamb was fattier than the lamb kadai I've had at other places. The portion was small but filling. I went with a party of 20 and I'm pretty sure most people's reactions were that the size was much smaller than expected. The momo's (dumplings) were quite nice and had strong tang of ginger in the filling, which I love, but may not be everyone's  cup of tea. Some issues that made me *almost* bump this review to 2 stars:I ordered a red wine, which was fine, but was dismayed to find the dregs at the bottom of the glass (see pictures). That should never, ever happen. I mean, would you serve your friends the dregs from the bottom of the bottle?? Another member of my party waited a good 10 minutes for her naan to come out. They gave her twice the portion to make up for it, but she didn't need more...she just needed it to be ready with her warm dish when it first came out. I tried the naan too -- it was a bit thick and undercooked for my taste. It was also bland."
487,"8/6/16: Sorry, it's been too long since I ate here, and I've forgotten most of the details except my overall impression.  My friend talked it up before we got here, so I was expecting something pretty special and yummy, but to be honest, this food is extremely similar to Indian.  Of course, I'm not Indian so I'm sure they'd disagree, but for the rest of us, I doubt there's too huge of a difference.  For instance, they got nan's, though I guess the difference would be it's spelled ""nan"" instead of ""naan.""  But otherwise, tastes the same.  The curries taste the same too.  I think just about the only thing we tried that they don't have at Indian restaurants would be the dumplings.Anyway, this is what we had:1. Mango Lassi $3.502. Cono Sur Reisling $73. #2 Vegetable Pakora (5 Pieces) $4.95 ""mixed golden-fried vegetable fritters, served with mint sauce"":  Was okay. Like the fried vegetables at Indian buffets. 5/104. #9 Mixed Momo $10.95 ""momo sampler platter; 3 pieces of chicken, lamb and vegetable momo, served with tomato chutney""5. Nan of the month Badami Nan $3.95 ""stuffed cherry and nuts"":  Tastes like a PBJ sandwich. Really odd. Better suited for dessert. No one ate it after a bite. 3/106. Special #1 Baigain Bhartha $12.95 ""tandoor roasted eggplant, mashed and tempered with garlic and mustard seeds, then cooked with green peas in onion tomato based sauce"":  I remember this actually tasted pretty good, with a wonderfully tasty sauce. 7/107. #31 Himalayan Balti $15.95 ""assorted pieces of chicken breast, lamb cubes, shrimps, cauliflower, and potatoes cooked in house special sauce"":  Don't remember details except it wasn't that impressive. 5/108. Special #4 Lamb Kadai $14.95 with Garlic Nan $1.50 ""slow cooked boneless leg of lamb sauteed with onion and bell peppers then cooked with tomato and onion based gravy"":  Same deal. Tasted fine but nothing special. 5/103/5#himalayan #napalese #indian #naan #nan"
488,"Food was alright didn't really had taste to it everything tasted the same except the Chicken they were pretty good,Mango lassi tasted like over dose of yogurt no mango flavor Make sure to ask them for utensils when you order for delivery they do not even include napkins"
489,"One of the worst restaurant meals I've ever had. Dishwater broth, Naan was greasy and under cooked. The rest of the meal was poor in taste and portion.Service was rude and incompetent.This was a couple of years ago, perhaps they've improved but I won't know. Only blocks from home, but it was so bad I'll never go back."
490,One of my all time favorite restaurants. The food is fabulous the Naan is to die for and the service is friendly and fast and professional.
491,I've eaten here before and it was good. Recently I had a to-go order that took forever.I randomly (probably starvingly) wanted samosas. I called and ordered.They claimed it would be ready in 10mins. I arrived. Then I had to wait an additional 20 mins. Not fun at all. The samosas were ok. But I don't like waiting so I think I would hesitate to go back in fear of waiting an eternity.
492,"There isn't a glimmer of doubt in my mind that this is the finest Indian food I've tasted. These flavors jump boldly off the plate and unabashedly embrace the palette. Carefully developed balances of spice, savory, sweet, and sour seem to engage in some ancient dance to produce a dazzling and mystifying culinary experience. Combined with tasteful decor, excellent service, and a menu overflowing with vegan and vegetarian dishes, I eagerly anticipate my next visit to Taste of the Himalayas."
493,"I REALLY enjoy spicy Indian food and this restaurant got it right! The goat Biriyani was fantastic. The raita could have had more cucumber but was very good.I enjoyed the dall as well. One star off for the dryness of the rice.I will eat here more often and try other things. Their vegetarian menu looks fantastic, so I may eat here at least twice a monthBerkeley has a lot of Indian restaurants, but the great flavors here and the reasonable prices win my heart and wallet"
494,I have been to Taste of the Himalayas multiple times.  It has always been a very positive experience.  The people are courteous.  The food is VERY authentic and so delicious.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.My only criticism: I wish they were open for Sunday lunch. That way I can avoid the craziness of Berkeley traffic and parking.
495,I love Taste of the Himalayan restaurant. I basically tried momo and mango lassi they have and the service and staff are friendly.
496,"The food and service were great , quality of the food overall I would say is pretty goood especially after trying from various indian restaurants around I give this place a thumbs up !

538,"This is really my favorite indian food lately.  Some old standard indian places have let me down lately, but this is consistently good, and their lunch special is cool with a nice assortment of different things.  Just wish they included Palak Paneer as a choice.  Nice ambiance and drinks selection too- okay for a quick work lunch or for celebrating a nicer meal."
539,"Weeknight dinner. Chicken tikka masala (mild) with brown rice was delicious, as were the delicately buttered naan bread and the lentil soup. Comfortable atmosphere and amiable, welcoming, attentive, and helpful staff. Hope to return soon to try more dishes."
540,"Service was excellent. The staff was friendly & attentive.Chicken & veggie momos were tasty. Pretty large portion and filling.The ""aloo bhanta"" eggplant vegetarian dish was delicious.Naan was perfect. Will definitely return soon."
541,"I was really disappointed with the restaurant especially knowing it has 4stars rating on Yelp.The momos was hardly comparable to the ones I've had in Hong Kong. The lamb was still a bit uncooked. (I had stomach problem later in the day, not sure if related to this.) Quite a few of them also had broken skins.Samosa was dry and pretty bland. The garlic naan was good and probably the only decent dish of all.Chicken Tikka Masala had nice sauce but the chicken itself was pretty dry. Shrimp vindaloo was okay but there were only a few shrimps inside.The mango lassi had too much yoghort inside and I couldn't really taste the mango.Overall the serving portions were really small (except for the momos, which we couldn't even finish) and the taste was barely okay.This was probably one of the worst meals I've had this year. Definitely not coming back here."
542,"Got the Groupon for this restaurant and had lunch there recently. This restaurant is nicely situated next to some other cool shops and restaurants in Berkeley. I had high hopes for this restaurant delivering on some quality Indian and Nepalese cuisine.There was not a lot of flexibility on where we could sit, despite the near empty restaurant. We were steered towards a small table in the back and middle of the room. I think I was seated in the darkest part of the restaurant - highly recommend sitting closer to the windows with sunlight streaming in or center of the dining room.Service was delivered with a smile but was pretty slow. The mixed biryani was fairly bland. Samosas were just OK - needed more flavor and seemed to have used the bare minimum in spices. Don't be fooled by the value offered by the Groupon - unless this place can up the taste and flavor of its entrees, it's not worth spending your time or energy trying to dine here.UPDATED: After I posted this, Manny A. sent me the following note, labelled as a ""compliment""Manny A.San Francisco, CA 0 friends 4 reviews 4 photos Just a Note 5/18/2017For your review of: Taste of the Himalayas""Looks like your very sensitive person.i don't know your age but you sound like a lil cry baby""Wonder if the owner of the Taste of the Himalayas got upset and had his buddy bro send me this nastygram...lol. In any event, I guess the truth hurts, and my review upset someone. Sorry, next time do better."
543,"There is such a positive vibe in this place, from the friendly ""Namaste"" greeting to the beautiful decor.Service was fast and friendly, which is always a plus.We ordered the chicken tikka masala, shrimp korma, and garlic naan bread. All of which was season to perfect. Our meals were served with lentil soup, which was also very tasty."
544,"First time here, saw a deal on Groupon and bought it because of the reviews. We ordered on the phone since the Groupon was for take out ($20 for $10). 1. We ordered lamb tarkari and 2 garlic naans and this was about $25 before applying the Groupon. Along with our order, we got some kind of soup and a side of rice. I was really happy about the rice because I didn't expect it.2. I've had better lamb curries in my life. There were a lot of lamb chunks but they weren't tender. This lamb was slightly overcooked. The curry itself lacked spice. 3. The garlic naan was probably the highlight of our meal. I wish they didn't wrap it in foil because the naan became slightly soggy. 4. I wish they told us what kind of soup they gave us though. It was kind of squash-y and pea-y - couldn't really tell but it lacked flavor."
545,Momos mean dumplings and that's their specialty here. I like their lamb momos. It's lightly on the gamey side. Tikka masala is nicely creamy. Rice and naan was spot on.Calming decor vibes and service was friendly.
546,"(Preface: I absolutely love Indian food, having been spoiled by authentic and affordable cuisine in central Jersey.) So the lamb kadai was only alright: the sauce was pretty standard and the lamb was fattier than the lamb kadai I've had at other places. The portion was small but filling. I went with a party of 20 and I'm pretty sure most people's reactions were that the size was much smaller than expected. The momo's (dumplings) were quite nice and had strong tang of ginger in the filling, which I love, but may not be everyone's  cup of tea. Some issues that made me *almost* bump this review to 2 stars:I ordered a red wine, which was fine, but was dismayed to find the dregs at the bottom of the glass (see pictures). That should never, ever happen. I mean, would you serve your friends the dregs from the bottom of the bottle?? Another member of my party waited a good 10 minutes for her naan to come out. They gave her twice the portion to make up for it, but she didn't need more...she just needed it to be ready with her warm dish when it first came out. I tried the naan too -- it was a bit thick and undercooked for my taste. It was also bland."
547,"8/6/16: Sorry, it's been too long since I ate here, and I've forgotten most of the details except my overall impression.  My friend talked it up before we got here, so I was expecting something pretty special and yummy, but to be honest, this food is extremely similar to Indian.  Of course, I'm not Indian so I'm sure they'd disagree, but for the rest of us, I doubt there's too huge of a difference.  For instance, they got nan's, though I guess the difference would be it's spelled ""nan"" instead of ""naan.""  But otherwise, tastes the same.  The curries taste the same too.  I think just about the only thing we tried that they don't have at Indian restaurants would be the dumplings.Anyway, this is what we had:1. Mango Lassi $3.502. Cono Sur Reisling $73. #2 Vegetable Pakora (5 Pieces) $4.95 ""mixed golden-fried vegetable fritters, served with mint sauce"":  Was okay. Like the fried vegetables at Indian buffets. 5/104. #9 Mixed Momo $10.95 ""momo sampler platter; 3 pieces of chicken, lamb and vegetable momo, served with tomato chutney""5. Nan of the month Badami Nan $3.95 ""stuffed cherry and nuts"":  Tastes like a PBJ sandwich. Really odd. Better suited for dessert. No one ate it after a bite. 3/106. Special #1 Baigain Bhartha $12.95 ""tandoor roasted eggplant, mashed and tempered with garlic and mustard seeds, then cooked with green peas in onion tomato based sauce"":  I remember this actually tasted pretty good, with a wonderfully tasty sauce. 7/107. #31 Himalayan Balti $15.95 ""assorted pieces of chicken breast, lamb cubes, shrimps, cauliflower, and potatoes cooked in house special sauce"":  Don't remember details except it wasn't that impressive. 5/108. Special #4 Lamb Kadai $14.95 with Garlic Nan $1.50 ""slow cooked boneless leg of lamb sauteed with onion and bell peppers then cooked with tomato and onion based gravy"":  Same deal. Tasted fine but nothing special. 5/103/5#himalayan #napalese #indian #naan #nan"
548,"Food was alright didn't really had taste to it everything tasted the same except the Chicken they were pretty good,Mango lassi tasted like over dose of yogurt no mango flavor Make sure to ask them for utensils when you order for delivery they do not even include napkins"
549,"One of the worst restaurant meals I've ever had. Dishwater broth, Naan was greasy and under cooked. The rest of the meal was poor in taste and portion.Service was rude and incompetent.This was a couple of years ago, perhaps they've improved but I won't know. Only blocks from home, but it was so bad I'll never go back."
550,One of my all time favorite restaurants. The food is fabulous the Naan is to die for and the service is friendly and fast and professional.
551,I've eaten here before and it was good. Recently I had a to-go order that took forever.I randomly (probably starvingly) wanted samosas. I called and ordered.They claimed it would be ready in 10mins. I arrived. Then I had to wait an additional 20 mins. Not fun at all. The samosas were ok. But I don't like waiting so I think I would hesitate to go back in fear of waiting an eternity.
552,"There isn't a glimmer of doubt in my mind that this is the finest Indian food I've tasted. These flavors jump boldly off the plate and unabashedly embrace the palette. Carefully developed balances of spice, savory, sweet, and sour seem to engage in some ancient dance to produce a dazzling and mystifying culinary experience. Combined with tasteful decor, excellent service, and a menu overflowing with vegan and vegetarian dishes, I eagerly anticipate my next visit to Taste of the Himalayas."
553,"I REALLY enjoy spicy Indian food and this restaurant got it right! The goat Biriyani was fantastic. The raita could have had more cucumber but was very good.I enjoyed the dall as well. One star off for the dryness of the rice.I will eat here more often and try other things. Their vegetarian menu looks fantastic, so I may eat here at least twice a monthBerkeley has a lot of Indian restaurants, but the great flavors here and the reasonable prices win my heart and wallet"
554,I have been to Taste of the Himalayas multiple times.  It has always been a very positive experience.  The people are courteous.  The food is VERY authentic and so delicious.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.My only criticism: I wish they were open for Sunday lunch. That way I can avoid the craziness of Berkeley traffic and parking.
555,I love Taste of the Himalayan restaurant. I basically tried momo and mango lassi they have and the service and staff are friendly.
556,"The food and service were great , quality of the food overall I would say is pretty goood especially after trying from various indian restaurants around I give this place a thumbs up !

598,"This is really my favorite indian food lately.  Some old standard indian places have let me down lately, but this is consistently good, and their lunch special is cool with a nice assortment of different things.  Just wish they included Palak Paneer as a choice.  Nice ambiance and drinks selection too- okay for a quick work lunch or for celebrating a nicer meal."
599,"Weeknight dinner. Chicken tikka masala (mild) with brown rice was delicious, as were the delicately buttered naan bread and the lentil soup. Comfortable atmosphere and amiable, welcoming, attentive, and helpful staff. Hope to return soon to try more dishes."
600,"Service was excellent. The staff was friendly & attentive.Chicken & veggie momos were tasty. Pretty large portion and filling.The ""aloo bhanta"" eggplant vegetarian dish was delicious.Naan was perfect. Will definitely return soon."
601,"I was really disappointed with the restaurant especially knowing it has 4stars rating on Yelp.The momos was hardly comparable to the ones I've had in Hong Kong. The lamb was still a bit uncooked. (I had stomach problem later in the day, not sure if related to this.) Quite a few of them also had broken skins.Samosa was dry and pretty bland. The garlic naan was good and probably the only decent dish of all.Chicken Tikka Masala had nice sauce but the chicken itself was pretty dry. Shrimp vindaloo was okay but there were only a few shrimps inside.The mango lassi had too much yoghort inside and I couldn't really taste the mango.Overall the serving portions were really small (except for the momos, which we couldn't even finish) and the taste was barely okay.This was probably one of the worst meals I've had this year. Definitely not coming back here."
602,"Got the Groupon for this restaurant and had lunch there recently. This restaurant is nicely situated next to some other cool shops and restaurants in Berkeley. I had high hopes for this restaurant delivering on some quality Indian and Nepalese cuisine.There was not a lot of flexibility on where we could sit, despite the near empty restaurant. We were steered towards a small table in the back and middle of the room. I think I was seated in the darkest part of the restaurant - highly recommend sitting closer to the windows with sunlight streaming in or center of the dining room.Service was delivered with a smile but was pretty slow. The mixed biryani was fairly bland. Samosas were just OK - needed more flavor and seemed to have used the bare minimum in spices. Don't be fooled by the value offered by the Groupon - unless this place can up the taste and flavor of its entrees, it's not worth spending your time or energy trying to dine here.UPDATED: After I posted this, Manny A. sent me the following note, labelled as a ""compliment""Manny A.San Francisco, CA 0 friends 4 reviews 4 photos Just a Note 5/18/2017For your review of: Taste of the Himalayas""Looks like your very sensitive person.i don't know your age but you sound like a lil cry baby""Wonder if the owner of the Taste of the Himalayas got upset and had his buddy bro send me this nastygram...lol. In any event, I guess the truth hurts, and my review upset someone. Sorry, next time do better."
603,"There is such a positive vibe in this place, from the friendly ""Namaste"" greeting to the beautiful decor.Service was fast and friendly, which is always a plus.We ordered the chicken tikka masala, shrimp korma, and garlic naan bread. All of which was season to perfect. Our meals were served with lentil soup, which was also very tasty."
604,"First time here, saw a deal on Groupon and bought it because of the reviews. We ordered on the phone since the Groupon was for take out ($20 for $10). 1. We ordered lamb tarkari and 2 garlic naans and this was about $25 before applying the Groupon. Along with our order, we got some kind of soup and a side of rice. I was really happy about the rice because I didn't expect it.2. I've had better lamb curries in my life. There were a lot of lamb chunks but they weren't tender. This lamb was slightly overcooked. The curry itself lacked spice. 3. The garlic naan was probably the highlight of our meal. I wish they didn't wrap it in foil because the naan became slightly soggy. 4. I wish they told us what kind of soup they gave us though. It was kind of squash-y and pea-y - couldn't really tell but it lacked flavor."
605,Momos mean dumplings and that's their specialty here. I like their lamb momos. It's lightly on the gamey side. Tikka masala is nicely creamy. Rice and naan was spot on.Calming decor vibes and service was friendly.
606,"(Preface: I absolutely love Indian food, having been spoiled by authentic and affordable cuisine in central Jersey.) So the lamb kadai was only alright: the sauce was pretty standard and the lamb was fattier than the lamb kadai I've had at other places. The portion was small but filling. I went with a party of 20 and I'm pretty sure most people's reactions were that the size was much smaller than expected. The momo's (dumplings) were quite nice and had strong tang of ginger in the filling, which I love, but may not be everyone's  cup of tea. Some issues that made me *almost* bump this review to 2 stars:I ordered a red wine, which was fine, but was dismayed to find the dregs at the bottom of the glass (see pictures). That should never, ever happen. I mean, would you serve your friends the dregs from the bottom of the bottle?? Another member of my party waited a good 10 minutes for her naan to come out. They gave her twice the portion to make up for it, but she didn't need more...she just needed it to be ready with her warm dish when it first came out. I tried the naan too -- it was a bit thick and undercooked for my taste. It was also bland."
607,"8/6/16: Sorry, it's been too long since I ate here, and I've forgotten most of the details except my overall impression.  My friend talked it up before we got here, so I was expecting something pretty special and yummy, but to be honest, this food is extremely similar to Indian.  Of course, I'm not Indian so I'm sure they'd disagree, but for the rest of us, I doubt there's too huge of a difference.  For instance, they got nan's, though I guess the difference would be it's spelled ""nan"" instead of ""naan.""  But otherwise, tastes the same.  The curries taste the same too.  I think just about the only thing we tried that they don't have at Indian restaurants would be the dumplings.Anyway, this is what we had:1. Mango Lassi $3.502. Cono Sur Reisling $73. #2 Vegetable Pakora (5 Pieces) $4.95 ""mixed golden-fried vegetable fritters, served with mint sauce"":  Was okay. Like the fried vegetables at Indian buffets. 5/104. #9 Mixed Momo $10.95 ""momo sampler platter; 3 pieces of chicken, lamb and vegetable momo, served with tomato chutney""5. Nan of the month Badami Nan $3.95 ""stuffed cherry and nuts"":  Tastes like a PBJ sandwich. Really odd. Better suited for dessert. No one ate it after a bite. 3/106. Special #1 Baigain Bhartha $12.95 ""tandoor roasted eggplant, mashed and tempered with garlic and mustard seeds, then cooked with green peas in onion tomato based sauce"":  I remember this actually tasted pretty good, with a wonderfully tasty sauce. 7/107. #31 Himalayan Balti $15.95 ""assorted pieces of chicken breast, lamb cubes, shrimps, cauliflower, and potatoes cooked in house special sauce"":  Don't remember details except it wasn't that impressive. 5/108. Special #4 Lamb Kadai $14.95 with Garlic Nan $1.50 ""slow cooked boneless leg of lamb sauteed with onion and bell peppers then cooked with tomato and onion based gravy"":  Same deal. Tasted fine but nothing special. 5/103/5#himalayan #napalese #indian #naan #nan"
608,"Food was alright didn't really had taste to it everything tasted the same except the Chicken they were pretty good,Mango lassi tasted like over dose of yogurt no mango flavor Make sure to ask them for utensils when you order for delivery they do not even include napkins"
609,"One of the worst restaurant meals I've ever had. Dishwater broth, Naan was greasy and under cooked. The rest of the meal was poor in taste and portion.Service was rude and incompetent.This was a couple of years ago, perhaps they've improved but I won't know. Only blocks from home, but it was so bad I'll never go back."
610,One of my all time favorite restaurants. The food is fabulous the Naan is to die for and the service is friendly and fast and professional.
611,I've eaten here before and it was good. Recently I had a to-go order that took forever.I randomly (probably starvingly) wanted samosas. I called and ordered.They claimed it would be ready in 10mins. I arrived. Then I had to wait an additional 20 mins. Not fun at all. The samosas were ok. But I don't like waiting so I think I would hesitate to go back in fear of waiting an eternity.
612,"There isn't a glimmer of doubt in my mind that this is the finest Indian food I've tasted. These flavors jump boldly off the plate and unabashedly embrace the palette. Carefully developed balances of spice, savory, sweet, and sour seem to engage in some ancient dance to produce a dazzling and mystifying culinary experience. Combined with tasteful decor, excellent service, and a menu overflowing with vegan and vegetarian dishes, I eagerly anticipate my next visit to Taste of the Himalayas."
613,"I REALLY enjoy spicy Indian food and this restaurant got it right! The goat Biriyani was fantastic. The raita could have had more cucumber but was very good.I enjoyed the dall as well. One star off for the dryness of the rice.I will eat here more often and try other things. Their vegetarian menu looks fantastic, so I may eat here at least twice a monthBerkeley has a lot of Indian restaurants, but the great flavors here and the reasonable prices win my heart and wallet"
614,I have been to Taste of the Himalayas multiple times.  It has always been a very positive experience.  The people are courteous.  The food is VERY authentic and so delicious.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.My only criticism: I wish they were open for Sunday lunch. That way I can avoid the craziness of Berkeley traffic and parking.
615,I love Taste of the Himalayan restaurant. I basically tried momo and mango lassi they have and the service and staff are friendly.
616,"The food and service were great , quality of the food overall I would say is pretty goood especially after trying from various indian restaurants around I give this place a thumbs up !

658,"This is really my favorite indian food lately.  Some old standard indian places have let me down lately, but this is consistently good, and their lunch special is cool with a nice assortment of different things.  Just wish they included Palak Paneer as a choice.  Nice ambiance and drinks selection too- okay for a quick work lunch or for celebrating a nicer meal."
659,"Weeknight dinner. Chicken tikka masala (mild) with brown rice was delicious, as were the delicately buttered naan bread and the lentil soup. Comfortable atmosphere and amiable, welcoming, attentive, and helpful staff. Hope to return soon to try more dishes."
660,"Service was excellent. The staff was friendly & attentive.Chicken & veggie momos were tasty. Pretty large portion and filling.The ""aloo bhanta"" eggplant vegetarian dish was delicious.Naan was perfect. Will definitely return soon."
661,"I was really disappointed with the restaurant especially knowing it has 4stars rating on Yelp.The momos was hardly comparable to the ones I've had in Hong Kong. The lamb was still a bit uncooked. (I had stomach problem later in the day, not sure if related to this.) Quite a few of them also had broken skins.Samosa was dry and pretty bland. The garlic naan was good and probably the only decent dish of all.Chicken Tikka Masala had nice sauce but the chicken itself was pretty dry. Shrimp vindaloo was okay but there were only a few shrimps inside.The mango lassi had too much yoghort inside and I couldn't really taste the mango.Overall the serving portions were really small (except for the momos, which we couldn't even finish) and the taste was barely okay.This was probably one of the worst meals I've had this year. Definitely not coming back here."
662,"Got the Groupon for this restaurant and had lunch there recently. This restaurant is nicely situated next to some other cool shops and restaurants in Berkeley. I had high hopes for this restaurant delivering on some quality Indian and Nepalese cuisine.There was not a lot of flexibility on where we could sit, despite the near empty restaurant. We were steered towards a small table in the back and middle of the room. I think I was seated in the darkest part of the restaurant - highly recommend sitting closer to the windows with sunlight streaming in or center of the dining room.Service was delivered with a smile but was pretty slow. The mixed biryani was fairly bland. Samosas were just OK - needed more flavor and seemed to have used the bare minimum in spices. Don't be fooled by the value offered by the Groupon - unless this place can up the taste and flavor of its entrees, it's not worth spending your time or energy trying to dine here.UPDATED: After I posted this, Manny A. sent me the following note, labelled as a ""compliment""Manny A.San Francisco, CA 0 friends 4 reviews 4 photos Just a Note 5/18/2017For your review of: Taste of the Himalayas""Looks like your very sensitive person.i don't know your age but you sound like a lil cry baby""Wonder if the owner of the Taste of the Himalayas got upset and had his buddy bro send me this nastygram...lol. In any event, I guess the truth hurts, and my review upset someone. Sorry, next time do better."
663,"There is such a positive vibe in this place, from the friendly ""Namaste"" greeting to the beautiful decor.Service was fast and friendly, which is always a plus.We ordered the chicken tikka masala, shrimp korma, and garlic naan bread. All of which was season to perfect. Our meals were served with lentil soup, which was also very tasty."
664,"First time here, saw a deal on Groupon and bought it because of the reviews. We ordered on the phone since the Groupon was for take out ($20 for $10). 1. We ordered lamb tarkari and 2 garlic naans and this was about $25 before applying the Groupon. Along with our order, we got some kind of soup and a side of rice. I was really happy about the rice because I didn't expect it.2. I've had better lamb curries in my life. There were a lot of lamb chunks but they weren't tender. This lamb was slightly overcooked. The curry itself lacked spice. 3. The garlic naan was probably the highlight of our meal. I wish they didn't wrap it in foil because the naan became slightly soggy. 4. I wish they told us what kind of soup they gave us though. It was kind of squash-y and pea-y - couldn't really tell but it lacked flavor."
665,Momos mean dumplings and that's their specialty here. I like their lamb momos. It's lightly on the gamey side. Tikka masala is nicely creamy. Rice and naan was spot on.Calming decor vibes and service was friendly.
666,"(Preface: I absolutely love Indian food, having been spoiled by authentic and affordable cuisine in central Jersey.) So the lamb kadai was only alright: the sauce was pretty standard and the lamb was fattier than the lamb kadai I've had at other places. The portion was small but filling. I went with a party of 20 and I'm pretty sure most people's reactions were that the size was much smaller than expected. The momo's (dumplings) were quite nice and had strong tang of ginger in the filling, which I love, but may not be everyone's  cup of tea. Some issues that made me *almost* bump this review to 2 stars:I ordered a red wine, which was fine, but was dismayed to find the dregs at the bottom of the glass (see pictures). That should never, ever happen. I mean, would you serve your friends the dregs from the bottom of the bottle?? Another member of my party waited a good 10 minutes for her naan to come out. They gave her twice the portion to make up for it, but she didn't need more...she just needed it to be ready with her warm dish when it first came out. I tried the naan too -- it was a bit thick and undercooked for my taste. It was also bland."
667,"8/6/16: Sorry, it's been too long since I ate here, and I've forgotten most of the details except my overall impression.  My friend talked it up before we got here, so I was expecting something pretty special and yummy, but to be honest, this food is extremely similar to Indian.  Of course, I'm not Indian so I'm sure they'd disagree, but for the rest of us, I doubt there's too huge of a difference.  For instance, they got nan's, though I guess the difference would be it's spelled ""nan"" instead of ""naan.""  But otherwise, tastes the same.  The curries taste the same too.  I think just about the only thing we tried that they don't have at Indian restaurants would be the dumplings.Anyway, this is what we had:1. Mango Lassi $3.502. Cono Sur Reisling $73. #2 Vegetable Pakora (5 Pieces) $4.95 ""mixed golden-fried vegetable fritters, served with mint sauce"":  Was okay. Like the fried vegetables at Indian buffets. 5/104. #9 Mixed Momo $10.95 ""momo sampler platter; 3 pieces of chicken, lamb and vegetable momo, served with tomato chutney""5. Nan of the month Badami Nan $3.95 ""stuffed cherry and nuts"":  Tastes like a PBJ sandwich. Really odd. Better suited for dessert. No one ate it after a bite. 3/106. Special #1 Baigain Bhartha $12.95 ""tandoor roasted eggplant, mashed and tempered with garlic and mustard seeds, then cooked with green peas in onion tomato based sauce"":  I remember this actually tasted pretty good, with a wonderfully tasty sauce. 7/107. #31 Himalayan Balti $15.95 ""assorted pieces of chicken breast, lamb cubes, shrimps, cauliflower, and potatoes cooked in house special sauce"":  Don't remember details except it wasn't that impressive. 5/108. Special #4 Lamb Kadai $14.95 with Garlic Nan $1.50 ""slow cooked boneless leg of lamb sauteed with onion and bell peppers then cooked with tomato and onion based gravy"":  Same deal. Tasted fine but nothing special. 5/103/5#himalayan #napalese #indian #naan #nan"
668,"Food was alright didn't really had taste to it everything tasted the same except the Chicken they were pretty good,Mango lassi tasted like over dose of yogurt no mango flavor Make sure to ask them for utensils when you order for delivery they do not even include napkins"
669,"One of the worst restaurant meals I've ever had. Dishwater broth, Naan was greasy and under cooked. The rest of the meal was poor in taste and portion.Service was rude and incompetent.This was a couple of years ago, perhaps they've improved but I won't know. Only blocks from home, but it was so bad I'll never go back."
670,One of my all time favorite restaurants. The food is fabulous the Naan is to die for and the service is friendly and fast and professional.
671,I've eaten here before and it was good. Recently I had a to-go order that took forever.I randomly (probably starvingly) wanted samosas. I called and ordered.They claimed it would be ready in 10mins. I arrived. Then I had to wait an additional 20 mins. Not fun at all. The samosas were ok. But I don't like waiting so I think I would hesitate to go back in fear of waiting an eternity.
672,"There isn't a glimmer of doubt in my mind that this is the finest Indian food I've tasted. These flavors jump boldly off the plate and unabashedly embrace the palette. Carefully developed balances of spice, savory, sweet, and sour seem to engage in some ancient dance to produce a dazzling and mystifying culinary experience. Combined with tasteful decor, excellent service, and a menu overflowing with vegan and vegetarian dishes, I eagerly anticipate my next visit to Taste of the Himalayas."
673,"I REALLY enjoy spicy Indian food and this restaurant got it right! The goat Biriyani was fantastic. The raita could have had more cucumber but was very good.I enjoyed the dall as well. One star off for the dryness of the rice.I will eat here more often and try other things. Their vegetarian menu looks fantastic, so I may eat here at least twice a monthBerkeley has a lot of Indian restaurants, but the great flavors here and the reasonable prices win my heart and wallet"
674,I have been to Taste of the Himalayas multiple times.  It has always been a very positive experience.  The people are courteous.  The food is VERY authentic and so delicious.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.My only criticism: I wish they were open for Sunday lunch. That way I can avoid the craziness of Berkeley traffic and parking.
675,I love Taste of the Himalayan restaurant. I basically tried momo and mango lassi they have and the service and staff are friendly.
676,"The food and service were great , quality of the food overall I would say is pretty goood especially after trying from various indian restaurants around I give this place a thumbs up !

718,"This is really my favorite indian food lately.  Some old standard indian places have let me down lately, but this is consistently good, and their lunch special is cool with a nice assortment of different things.  Just wish they included Palak Paneer as a choice.  Nice ambiance and drinks selection too- okay for a quick work lunch or for celebrating a nicer meal."
719,"Weeknight dinner. Chicken tikka masala (mild) with brown rice was delicious, as were the delicately buttered naan bread and the lentil soup. Comfortable atmosphere and amiable, welcoming, attentive, and helpful staff. Hope to return soon to try more dishes."
720,"Service was excellent. The staff was friendly & attentive.Chicken & veggie momos were tasty. Pretty large portion and filling.The ""aloo bhanta"" eggplant vegetarian dish was delicious.Naan was perfect. Will definitely return soon."
721,"I was really disappointed with the restaurant especially knowing it has 4stars rating on Yelp.The momos was hardly comparable to the ones I've had in Hong Kong. The lamb was still a bit uncooked. (I had stomach problem later in the day, not sure if related to this.) Quite a few of them also had broken skins.Samosa was dry and pretty bland. The garlic naan was good and probably the only decent dish of all.Chicken Tikka Masala had nice sauce but the chicken itself was pretty dry. Shrimp vindaloo was okay but there were only a few shrimps inside.The mango lassi had too much yoghort inside and I couldn't really taste the mango.Overall the serving portions were really small (except for the momos, which we couldn't even finish) and the taste was barely okay.This was probably one of the worst meals I've had this year. Definitely not coming back here."
722,"Got the Groupon for this restaurant and had lunch there recently. This restaurant is nicely situated next to some other cool shops and restaurants in Berkeley. I had high hopes for this restaurant delivering on some quality Indian and Nepalese cuisine.There was not a lot of flexibility on where we could sit, despite the near empty restaurant. We were steered towards a small table in the back and middle of the room. I think I was seated in the darkest part of the restaurant - highly recommend sitting closer to the windows with sunlight streaming in or center of the dining room.Service was delivered with a smile but was pretty slow. The mixed biryani was fairly bland. Samosas were just OK - needed more flavor and seemed to have used the bare minimum in spices. Don't be fooled by the value offered by the Groupon - unless this place can up the taste and flavor of its entrees, it's not worth spending your time or energy trying to dine here.UPDATED: After I posted this, Manny A. sent me the following note, labelled as a ""compliment""Manny A.San Francisco, CA 0 friends 4 reviews 4 photos Just a Note 5/18/2017For your review of: Taste of the Himalayas""Looks like your very sensitive person.i don't know your age but you sound like a lil cry baby""Wonder if the owner of the Taste of the Himalayas got upset and had his buddy bro send me this nastygram...lol. In any event, I guess the truth hurts, and my review upset someone. Sorry, next time do better."
723,"There is such a positive vibe in this place, from the friendly ""Namaste"" greeting to the beautiful decor.Service was fast and friendly, which is always a plus.We ordered the chicken tikka masala, shrimp korma, and garlic naan bread. All of which was season to perfect. Our meals were served with lentil soup, which was also very tasty."
724,"First time here, saw a deal on Groupon and bought it because of the reviews. We ordered on the phone since the Groupon was for take out ($20 for $10). 1. We ordered lamb tarkari and 2 garlic naans and this was about $25 before applying the Groupon. Along with our order, we got some kind of soup and a side of rice. I was really happy about the rice because I didn't expect it.2. I've had better lamb curries in my life. There were a lot of lamb chunks but they weren't tender. This lamb was slightly overcooked. The curry itself lacked spice. 3. The garlic naan was probably the highlight of our meal. I wish they didn't wrap it in foil because the naan became slightly soggy. 4. I wish they told us what kind of soup they gave us though. It was kind of squash-y and pea-y - couldn't really tell but it lacked flavor."
725,Momos mean dumplings and that's their specialty here. I like their lamb momos. It's lightly on the gamey side. Tikka masala is nicely creamy. Rice and naan was spot on.Calming decor vibes and service was friendly.
726,"(Preface: I absolutely love Indian food, having been spoiled by authentic and affordable cuisine in central Jersey.) So the lamb kadai was only alright: the sauce was pretty standard and the lamb was fattier than the lamb kadai I've had at other places. The portion was small but filling. I went with a party of 20 and I'm pretty sure most people's reactions were that the size was much smaller than expected. The momo's (dumplings) were quite nice and had strong tang of ginger in the filling, which I love, but may not be everyone's  cup of tea. Some issues that made me *almost* bump this review to 2 stars:I ordered a red wine, which was fine, but was dismayed to find the dregs at the bottom of the glass (see pictures). That should never, ever happen. I mean, would you serve your friends the dregs from the bottom of the bottle?? Another member of my party waited a good 10 minutes for her naan to come out. They gave her twice the portion to make up for it, but she didn't need more...she just needed it to be ready with her warm dish when it first came out. I tried the naan too -- it was a bit thick and undercooked for my taste. It was also bland."
727,"8/6/16: Sorry, it's been too long since I ate here, and I've forgotten most of the details except my overall impression.  My friend talked it up before we got here, so I was expecting something pretty special and yummy, but to be honest, this food is extremely similar to Indian.  Of course, I'm not Indian so I'm sure they'd disagree, but for the rest of us, I doubt there's too huge of a difference.  For instance, they got nan's, though I guess the difference would be it's spelled ""nan"" instead of ""naan.""  But otherwise, tastes the same.  The curries taste the same too.  I think just about the only thing we tried that they don't have at Indian restaurants would be the dumplings.Anyway, this is what we had:1. Mango Lassi $3.502. Cono Sur Reisling $73. #2 Vegetable Pakora (5 Pieces) $4.95 ""mixed golden-fried vegetable fritters, served with mint sauce"":  Was okay. Like the fried vegetables at Indian buffets. 5/104. #9 Mixed Momo $10.95 ""momo sampler platter; 3 pieces of chicken, lamb and vegetable momo, served with tomato chutney""5. Nan of the month Badami Nan $3.95 ""stuffed cherry and nuts"":  Tastes like a PBJ sandwich. Really odd. Better suited for dessert. No one ate it after a bite. 3/106. Special #1 Baigain Bhartha $12.95 ""tandoor roasted eggplant, mashed and tempered with garlic and mustard seeds, then cooked with green peas in onion tomato based sauce"":  I remember this actually tasted pretty good, with a wonderfully tasty sauce. 7/107. #31 Himalayan Balti $15.95 ""assorted pieces of chicken breast, lamb cubes, shrimps, cauliflower, and potatoes cooked in house special sauce"":  Don't remember details except it wasn't that impressive. 5/108. Special #4 Lamb Kadai $14.95 with Garlic Nan $1.50 ""slow cooked boneless leg of lamb sauteed with onion and bell peppers then cooked with tomato and onion based gravy"":  Same deal. Tasted fine but nothing special. 5/103/5#himalayan #napalese #indian #naan #nan"
728,"Food was alright didn't really had taste to it everything tasted the same except the Chicken they were pretty good,Mango lassi tasted like over dose of yogurt no mango flavor Make sure to ask them for utensils when you order for delivery they do not even include napkins"
729,"One of the worst restaurant meals I've ever had. Dishwater broth, Naan was greasy and under cooked. The rest of the meal was poor in taste and portion.Service was rude and incompetent.This was a couple of years ago, perhaps they've improved but I won't know. Only blocks from home, but it was so bad I'll never go back."
730,One of my all time favorite restaurants. The food is fabulous the Naan is to die for and the service is friendly and fast and professional.
731,I've eaten here before and it was good. Recently I had a to-go order that took forever.I randomly (probably starvingly) wanted samosas. I called and ordered.They claimed it would be ready in 10mins. I arrived. Then I had to wait an additional 20 mins. Not fun at all. The samosas were ok. But I don't like waiting so I think I would hesitate to go back in fear of waiting an eternity.
732,"There isn't a glimmer of doubt in my mind that this is the finest Indian food I've tasted. These flavors jump boldly off the plate and unabashedly embrace the palette. Carefully developed balances of spice, savory, sweet, and sour seem to engage in some ancient dance to produce a dazzling and mystifying culinary experience. Combined with tasteful decor, excellent service, and a menu overflowing with vegan and vegetarian dishes, I eagerly anticipate my next visit to Taste of the Himalayas."
733,"I REALLY enjoy spicy Indian food and this restaurant got it right! The goat Biriyani was fantastic. The raita could have had more cucumber but was very good.I enjoyed the dall as well. One star off for the dryness of the rice.I will eat here more often and try other things. Their vegetarian menu looks fantastic, so I may eat here at least twice a monthBerkeley has a lot of Indian restaurants, but the great flavors here and the reasonable prices win my heart and wallet"
734,I have been to Taste of the Himalayas multiple times.  It has always been a very positive experience.  The people are courteous.  The food is VERY authentic and so delicious.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.My only criticism: I wish they were open for Sunday lunch. That way I can avoid the craziness of Berkeley traffic and parking.
735,I love Taste of the Himalayan restaurant. I basically tried momo and mango lassi they have and the service and staff are friendly.
736,"The food and service were great , quality of the food overall I would say is pretty goood especially after trying from various indian restaurants around I give this place a thumbs up !

778,"This is really my favorite indian food lately.  Some old standard indian places have let me down lately, but this is consistently good, and their lunch special is cool with a nice assortment of different things.  Just wish they included Palak Paneer as a choice.  Nice ambiance and drinks selection too- okay for a quick work lunch or for celebrating a nicer meal."
779,"Weeknight dinner. Chicken tikka masala (mild) with brown rice was delicious, as were the delicately buttered naan bread and the lentil soup. Comfortable atmosphere and amiable, welcoming, attentive, and helpful staff. Hope to return soon to try more dishes."
