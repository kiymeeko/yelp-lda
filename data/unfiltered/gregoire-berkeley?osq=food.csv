1,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
2,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
3,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
4,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
5,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
6,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
7,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
8,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
9,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
10,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
11,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
12,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
13,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
14,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
15,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
16,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
17,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
18,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
19,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."

For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
42,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
43,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
44,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
45,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
46,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
47,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
48,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
49,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
50,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
51,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
52,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
53,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
54,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
55,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
56,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
57,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
58,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
59,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
60,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
61,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind.

I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
82,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
83,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
84,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
85,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
86,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
87,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
88,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
89,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
90,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
91,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
92,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
93,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
94,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
95,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
96,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
97,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
98,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
99,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
100,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
101,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register.

You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
124,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
125,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
126,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
127,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
128,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
129,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
130,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
131,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
132,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
133,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
134,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
135,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
136,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
137,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
138,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
139,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
140,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
141,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
142,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"

I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
164,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
165,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
166,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
167,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
168,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
169,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
170,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
171,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
172,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
173,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
174,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
175,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
176,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
177,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
178,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
179,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
180,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
181,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
182,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
183,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside.

I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
205,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
206,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
207,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
208,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
209,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
210,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
211,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
212,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
213,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
214,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
215,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
216,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
217,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
218,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
219,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
220,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
221,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
222,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
223,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food!

246,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
247,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
248,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
249,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
250,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
251,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
252,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
253,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
254,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
255,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
256,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
257,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
258,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
259,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
260,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
261,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
262,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
263,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"

It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
287,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
288,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
289,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
290,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
291,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
292,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
293,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
294,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
295,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
296,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
297,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
298,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
299,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
300,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
301,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
302,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
303,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
304,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
305,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."

327,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
328,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
329,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
330,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
331,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
332,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
333,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
334,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
335,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
336,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
337,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
338,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
339,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
340,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
341,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
342,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
343,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
344,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
345,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
346,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food.

368,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
369,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
370,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
371,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
372,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
373,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
374,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
375,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
376,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
377,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
378,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
379,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
380,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
381,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
382,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
383,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
384,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
385,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
386,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."

I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
409,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
410,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
411,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
412,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
413,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
414,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
415,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
416,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
417,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
418,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
419,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
420,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
421,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
422,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
423,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
424,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
425,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
426,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
427,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"

449,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
450,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
451,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
452,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
453,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
454,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
455,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
456,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
457,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
458,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
459,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
460,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
461,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
462,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
463,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
464,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
465,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
466,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
467,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
468,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior.

When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
490,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
491,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
492,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
493,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
494,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
495,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
496,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
497,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
498,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
499,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
500,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
501,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
502,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
503,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
504,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
505,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
506,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
507,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
508,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."

531,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
532,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
533,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
534,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
535,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
536,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
537,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
538,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
539,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
540,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
541,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
542,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
543,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
544,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
545,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
546,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
547,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
548,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
549,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there.

Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
573,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
574,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
575,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
576,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
577,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
578,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
579,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
580,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
581,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
582,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
583,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
584,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
585,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
586,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
587,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
588,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
589,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
590,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich?

Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
615,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
616,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
617,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
618,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
619,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
620,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
621,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
622,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
623,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
624,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
625,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
626,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
627,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
628,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
629,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
630,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
631,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
632,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board.

We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs.

656,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
657,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
658,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
659,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
660,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
661,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
662,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
663,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
664,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
665,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
666,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
667,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
668,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
669,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
670,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
671,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
672,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
673,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."

The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
698,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
699,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
700,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
701,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
702,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
703,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
704,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
705,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
706,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
707,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
708,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
709,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
710,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
711,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
712,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
713,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."

Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
715,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
716,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."

It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
738,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
739,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
740,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
741,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
742,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
743,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
744,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
745,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
746,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
747,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
748,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
749,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
750,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
751,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
752,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
753,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."

Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
755,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
756,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."

779,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
780,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
781,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
782,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
783,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
784,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
785,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
786,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
787,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
788,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
789,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
790,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
791,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
792,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
793,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
794,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
795,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
796,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
797,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."

820,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
821,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
822,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
823,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
824,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
825,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
826,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
827,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
828,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
829,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
830,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
831,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
832,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
833,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
834,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
835,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
836,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
837,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
838,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"

861,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
862,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
863,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
864,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
865,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
866,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
867,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
868,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
869,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
870,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
871,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
872,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
873,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
874,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
875,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
876,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
877,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
878,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"

I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
902,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
903,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
904,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
905,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
906,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
907,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
908,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
909,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
910,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
911,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
912,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
913,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
914,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
915,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
916,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
917,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
918,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
919,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."

I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
942,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
943,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
944,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
945,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
946,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
947,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
948,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
949,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
950,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
951,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
952,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
953,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
954,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
955,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
956,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
957,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
958,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
959,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."

961,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry.

Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
982,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
983,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
984,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
985,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
986,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
987,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
988,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
989,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
990,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
991,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
992,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
993,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
994,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
995,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
996,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
997,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
998,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
999,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
1000,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
1001,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here.

1022,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
1023,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
1024,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
1025,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
1026,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
1027,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
1028,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
1029,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
1030,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
1031,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
1032,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
1033,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
1034,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
1035,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
1036,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
1037,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
1038,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
1039,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
1040,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
1041,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here.

You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
1064,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
1065,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
1066,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
1067,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
1068,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
1069,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
1070,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
1071,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
1072,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
1073,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
1074,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
1075,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
1076,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
1077,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
1078,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
1079,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
1080,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
1081,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
1082,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"

I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
1104,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
1105,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
1106,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
1107,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
1108,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
1109,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
1110,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
1111,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
1112,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
1113,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
1114,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
1115,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
1116,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
1117,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
1118,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
1119,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
1120,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
1121,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
1122,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
1123,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside.

There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
1144,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
1145,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
1146,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
1147,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
1148,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
1149,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
1150,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
1151,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
1152,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
1153,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
1154,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
1155,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
1156,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
1157,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
1158,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
1159,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
1160,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
1161,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
1162,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
1163,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs.

1185,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
1186,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
1187,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
1188,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
1189,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
1190,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
1191,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
1192,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
1193,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
1194,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
1195,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
1196,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
1197,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
1198,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
1199,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
1200,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
1201,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
1202,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
1203,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"

It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
1227,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
1228,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
1229,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
1230,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
1231,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
1232,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
1233,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
1234,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
1235,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
1236,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
1237,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
1238,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
1239,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
1240,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
1241,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
1242,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
1243,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
1244,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain.

It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
1267,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
1268,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
1269,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
1270,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
1271,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
1272,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
1273,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
1274,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
1275,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
1276,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
1277,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
1278,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
1279,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
1280,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
1281,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
1282,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
1283,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
1284,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
1285,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."

Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
1307,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
1308,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
1309,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
1310,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
1311,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
1312,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
1313,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
1314,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
1315,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
1316,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
1317,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
1318,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
1319,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
1320,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
1321,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
1322,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
1323,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
1324,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
1325,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
1326,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat.

1347,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
1348,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
1349,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
1350,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
1351,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
1352,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
1353,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
1354,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
1355,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
1356,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
1357,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
1358,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
1359,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
1360,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
1361,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
1362,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
1363,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
1364,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
1365,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
1366,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food.

The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
1388,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
1389,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
1390,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
1391,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
1392,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
1393,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
1394,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
1395,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
1396,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
1397,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
1398,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
1399,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
1400,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
1401,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
1402,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
1403,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
1404,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
1405,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
1406,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."

These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
1429,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
1430,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
1431,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
1432,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
1433,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
1434,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
1435,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
1436,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
1437,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
1438,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
1439,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
1440,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
1441,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
1442,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
1443,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
1444,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
1445,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
1446,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."

I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
1469,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
1470,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
1471,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
1472,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
1473,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
1474,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
1475,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
1476,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
1477,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
1478,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
1479,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
1480,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
1481,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
1482,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
1483,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
1484,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
1485,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
1486,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
1487,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"

They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
1509,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
1510,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
1511,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
1512,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
1513,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
1514,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
1515,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
1516,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
1517,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
1518,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
1519,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
1520,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
1521,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
1522,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
1523,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
1524,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
1525,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
1526,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
1527,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"

Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior.

I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
1550,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
1551,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
1552,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
1553,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
1554,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
1555,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
1556,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
1557,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
1558,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
1559,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
1560,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
1561,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
1562,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
1563,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
1564,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
1565,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
1566,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
1567,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
1568,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."

And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
1591,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
1592,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
1593,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
1594,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
1595,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
1596,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
1597,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
1598,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
1599,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
1600,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
1601,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
1602,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
1603,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
1604,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
1605,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
1606,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
1607,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
1608,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
1609,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there.

We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
1633,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
1634,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
1635,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
1636,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
1637,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
1638,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
1639,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
1640,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
1641,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
1642,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
1643,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
1644,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
1645,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
1646,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
1647,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
1648,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
1649,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
1650,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich?

However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
1674,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
1675,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
1676,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
1677,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
1678,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
1679,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
1680,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
1681,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
1682,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
1683,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
1684,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
1685,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
1686,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
1687,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
1688,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
1689,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
1690,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich?

We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay.

Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
1715,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
1716,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
1717,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
1718,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
1719,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
1720,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
1721,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
1722,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
1723,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
1724,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
1725,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
1726,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
1727,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
1728,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
1729,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
1730,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
1731,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
1732,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
1733,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."

1756,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
1757,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
1758,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
1759,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
1760,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
1761,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
1762,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
1763,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
1764,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
1765,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
1766,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
1767,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
1768,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
1769,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
1770,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
1771,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
1772,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
1773,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."

1797,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
1798,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
1799,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
1800,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
1801,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
1802,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
1803,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
1804,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
1805,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
1806,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
1807,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
1808,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
1809,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
1810,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
1811,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
1812,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
1813,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
1814,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
1815,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
1816,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more.

You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
1838,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
1839,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
1840,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
1841,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
1842,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
1843,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
1844,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
1845,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
1846,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
1847,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
1848,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
1849,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
1850,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
1851,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
1852,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
1853,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
1854,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
1855,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
1856,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."

Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
1879,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
1880,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
1881,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
1882,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
1883,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
1884,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
1885,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
1886,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
1887,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
1888,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
1889,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
1890,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
1891,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
1892,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
1893,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
1894,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
1895,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
1896,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
1897,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees.

1919,"Like mashed potatoes and fried things?  Then the potato puffs ($6) at Gregoire's should be calling your name right now.  These little round balls are a signature item and are worth tasting once.  However, my go-to is the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich ($11).  The chicken is lightly fried and the spicy coleslaw mix on a french roll included in the sandwich balances the fried portion of the sandwich.  I get it every time I go and would recommend it if you like chicken sandwiches.  Everything is cooked from scratch and made to order.There are only a few seats outside of the restaurant so many people order it to go.  If you haven't been to Gregoire's lately, they have also added a combo option where you can add on a couple potato puffs or fries without having to put in a full order."
1920,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
1921,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
1922,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
1923,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
1924,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
1925,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
1926,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
1927,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
1928,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
1929,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
1930,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
1931,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
1932,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
1933,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
1934,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
1935,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
1936,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
1937,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
1938,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there.

1960,Always a solid choice. Get it to go since seating is limitedGet the potato puffCan't really go wrong otherwiseNot the cheapest place ever but a nice treat! Has awesome containers it's served in
1961,"Mixed emotions about this humble joint with amazing food. Perhaps I'll begin with why I love it before I ease into my qualms.The potato puffs. Sweet baby Jesus almighty. I'm going to be dreaming of these little suckers for such a long time. Think mashed potato balls scooped up and hit with a flash fry. You get a beautiful golden brown crust and a buttery and fluffy center of carb goodness that you can dip in their amazing aioli. If I knew how good these were, I would've had ordered more so I wouldn't have had to share!The tri-tip sandwich with mushrooms also made my morning. I split the sandwich with my friend and I too regret being so kind. The bread was amazing, the tri-tip and mushrooms were really satisfying, and what really brought the sandwich together was the horseradish cream. I admit, I'm salivating just thinking about this as I write about it.To satiate my sweet tooth, I also ordered the blueberry bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I love bread pudding and when I dug into it, it was so incredibly moist and dense. For someone who hates chocolate, I loved the accompaniment, perhaps because it reminded me more of condensed milk than anything else.I highly recommend all three things that I had ordered if you make a trip here. However, I did preface my review by saying I wasn't completely happy about my stop here and that's due to my experience with the worker at the register. So as I was reviewing the menu since I'm from out of town and approached to order (mind you, this is Saturday morning when they just opened so no one's here besides myself), I'm greeted with an abrasive ""what do you want?"" After placing the first item, he snapped at me and asked for my name first. Afterwards, he snarkily remarked the total and I felt confused because I was going to order more. Under his disgruntled breath, he undid whatever he had to on the register and waited until I put in the rest of my order. I proceeded to pass the time by looking at all the baked goods available for sale on the shelves when I hear a bag haphazardly tossed onto the counter. I didn't think anything of it but twenty seconds later I hear the same callous voice saying ""you, here, take it."" I don't know what his problem was but the whole experience was so souring I didn't bother eating out in front with my friends because I was so put off by this particular worker.Amazing food but apparently I'm going to have to lower my expectations of being treated respectfully here. That or just ask someone to pick it up for me."
1962,"Good for breakfast and lunch! I love their salad option so I have healthier options!Their sandwiches are yummy and potatoes as well. For dinner time, the food tastes good but I think it's a bit pricey so I don't prefer going there during dinner time.For the customer service, the casher was not really friendly... but other than that I was happy with this place :D"
1963,"Gregoire is a tiny take-out restaurant in the Gourmet Ghetto with just a few seats outside. However, when the lines aren't long, the turnover is quick, and my group got a seat right after ordering on a Sunday afternoon. You'd never expect amazing food to come out of a place like this, but they just churn out takeout box after takeout box of simple deliciousness!!I ordered the tri-tip sandwich, which came on a soft yet chewy Semifreddi French bread roll. The slices of steak were so nice and tender, and there was an enormous pile of mushrooms on top, which added a great umami flavor! The best part of the sandwich that brought everything together was the horseradish cream, which had tons of garlicky, spicy flavor without being overwhelming. I also ordered the organic mixed green salad with baked zucchini, peppers, corn, and pickled beets--every bite of this salad was so fresh, and the seasonal ingredients were so tasty. I got the salad with baked scallops and the slightly spicy jalapeno dressing, which had tons of herbs and enveloped the vegetables and scallops beautifully!And now, we have to talk about the potato puffs. I'm usually not the biggest fan of deep-fried foods, but the potato puffs here are amazing--crispy on the outside, and absolutely ethereal on the inside--kind of like mashed potatoes, but better! Not the least bit gummy, but simply hot, creamy, and comforting! You can get just a few on the side (a ""Puffgrade"") along with the dipping sauce when you order a sandwich, and this is just enough for a nice, light side!Come here to try the food! There's nothing fancy about the seating or the setting, but somehow, Gregoire just churns out delicious French-inspired fast food at an absolutely fantastic value!"
1964,"I would like to rave about the potato balls. I enjoy the crispiness and creaminess these spuds contain. I suggest getting a topping such as the garlic & parsley because that totally makes the dish. I tried something else before but I forgot, so sorry I can't comment on other dishes. I have heard from my friend that their sandwiches are quite tasty. Anyway, I come for the potato balls."
1965,"This divey little restaurant is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat in Berkeley!What to get:- Fried Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich $11.00.  Crispy and delicious!- Crispy Potato Puffs $6.00 + $2.00 for adding garlic and parsley.  They're basically crispy balls of mashed potatoes served with an aoli sauce.  Highly recommended!It's definitely a small spot with limited seating, so I view it as more of a to-go place with street parking only.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is always excellent."
1966,"Food 3/5. Service 4/5. Ambiance 4/5. A great lunch place in Berkeley, that lacks in seating. It makes me question a little how anyone would come here to eat in dinner. It's just far enough that it's not overtaken by UC Berkeley students. I think the real star of the show was the crispy potato puffs. They are perfectly fried, not too oily, and nothing more than fried buttery mashed potatoes. It comes with with a great aioli and for an extra two dollars there is different choices of toppings to enhance them like Parmesan, garlic and parsley, or white truffle essence. I wasn't a big fan of my main entree for lunch. I got the beef bulgogi salad style. There wasn't enough meat really and the dressing for the salad didn't compliment the meat. The salad was just lacking and needed extra toppings to make it a complete meal. However, my friend got the fried butternut squash sandwich and she said it was delicious. Even though, I didn't enjoy the main dish of my lunch, I'll will definitely come back and try a dish that's not made into a salad. Tips - No matter what get the crispy potato puffs, delicious. Even without the extra toppings on top they are delicious. Get them addition to your lunch, small side but cheaper.Pros - A very friendly shop, with high quality food. They cook right in front of you! Cons - Lacks in seating, and during lunch rush, it's really crowded and squished."
1967,"Solid 3.5 stars from me: food is on the better side, service and location are just okayJust as others have mentioned, Gregoire's has very limited seating and the seats and tables are all outdoors so come with a backup plan or keep scoping out the seating situation while waiting for the food (which does take quite a bit of time even if the line doesn't seem long or if it's 'off hours')The potato puffs: they're fluffy yet carb-y in the best way--if they're made correctly. There's been some inconsistencies the last few times I've gone. The star really is the buttery sauce though!Out of the lunches, I've only gotten the fried chicken sandwich and the meat is sometimes dry but definitely a safe pick since the flavors are usually good.The location is a bit far from UC Berkeley campus but it is a nice walk up north side!"
1968,"Like everyone else- You're probably coming here for their infamous Potato Puffs, and yes; they're good and I don't think you'd regret picking it up. These fried potato puffs are every bit of worth it and are fried, creamy, balls of potato starchy goodness.This location is rather tiny, but something about the size of it and the overall aesthetic of Grégoire is really charming. Adorable, but really not the type of situation you'd want to bring a large amount of people to eat inside. Seating is really limited, but I would just recommend ordering any food you're getting to go and eating elsewhere.The garlic potato puffs take a little bit of time to cook, as I remember waiting a decent amount of time for them. I had a friend who decided to get something at Crepevine across the street while I was ordering and she had already gotten her food + come back to find me still waiting for my potato puffs.The Garlic Potato Puffs are amazing. Really crispy and fried nicely on the outside, it still retains the very soft, creamy, and smooth texture you'd expect from mashed potatoes on the interior. The dipping sauce also really enhances the flavor of the puffs as well. I'd definitely recommend them as I don't think you'd be disappointed trying them.Overall I mean I'm pretty much rating this place on their signature Potato Puffs. They're good, yes- and I would recommend them if you're here; but I wouldn't make a special trip to come and get them, especially if I was on a time restraint (ie there's a line already there unless you don't mind a long wait time), plus it's not the best place to have a sit down meal."
1969,"We ordered one order of potato puffs with the truffle aioli (9 potato puffs). Took about 10 minutes to get our order. These potato puffs were extremely disappointing. Even with the sauce (that they forgot to give at first), I was still not impressed at all. I don't know if I ordered the wrong thing or what.. but they were bland and just tasted like deep fried mush. Our batch looked like it spent way too long in the fryer compared to other pics on Yelp! I wouldn't recommend these at all and don't think I'll be back for them. Customer service was seriously lacking, or at least during my experience. When I stepped up to the counter at the very beginning, the man at the register just stared at me, without saying hello or asking if I was ready to order. Yes, I am here, right at the register, ready to order? He just gave off a very unfriendly vibe and didn't seem like he was happy to be there. Hoping to change my mind about this place by maybe ordering something else next time. But not sure if there will be a next time.."
1970,"Somebody needs to teach that asian dude how to greet a customer. He couldn't even say hello or would you like a drink with your sandwich? And for $13 for a sandwich one would think they would give you a few potato  chips or maybe a pickle, they surely didnt go overboard with the tri tip.I'll never go back, nothing speciall here."
1971,"The potato puffs are to die for! So delicious and not heavy! Got those and a steak salad! Yes, I ordered too much food, but oh so worth it. It wasn't the cheapest lunch but it was yummy, filling, and worth it!"
1972,"We decided to walk over here to get the crispy potato puffs ($6) with white truffle essence ($2) for a quick snack since a long line formed at Cheese Board. Jokes on us, the person waiting for the pizza got it before we got the potato puffs, even though the line was shorter here! We waited approximately 15 mins for the potato puffs, a bit too long of a wait I would say. As for the potato puffs, I thought they were okay. The order includes nine pieces and it's basically creamy mashed potatoes inside with a crispy deep-fried exterior. The dipping sauce provided more flavor for the potato puffs. Overall, the potato puffs were okay for a snack, but I wouldn't get it again if there's a long wait."
1973,"Horrible customer service (specifically the young guy with a pony tail working at the cashier). Have always had a pleasant experience at this Gegoire location (friendly staff and consistent food). However this past weekend the young gentleman cashier was extremely rude and didn't even ask me if I wanted to place my order when he saw me standing there for a good while. When I did come up and ask him if I could order, he sarcastically asked me what I wanted very loudly and he seemed very annoyed to be doing so. Gregoire management: either train him at giving decent respectable customer service so its pleasant or just fire him."
1974,"I came here to see what all of the hype was about. After eating here, I can see why the potato puffs are so popular! I'm a big fan of the potato puffs here! Despite having one cook, we didn't have to wait too long for our potato puffs, at least on the day that we came here.Seating is scarce here. It's limited to two small tables with bench like seating. Don't be shy to ask if you can dine at the table with complete strangers (if your party can fit of course).I look forward dining here again!"
1975,"Potato puffs with truffle essence are a sin.Eggplant lavash sandwich is so so, not enough eggplant or too much lettuce which robbed the star ingredient's flavor. Needed a little something to make it above average.Order took quite awhile, but I had no problem waiting,... it was worth it. Very limited seating so most people take it to go."
1976,"Was really excited to try this spot but was sadly disappointed.A lunchtime order of potato puffs took nearly 15 minutes which was strike one here. $6 gets you about 9 or so potato puffs and for once, I didn't even really wish it got me more. While both me and my partner expected something with a bit more bite and flavor, only the outside of the potato puff was crispy while the inside revealed some rather bland potatoes. It was soft enough that it was essentially just creamy mashed potatoes inside which caused the potato puffs to break when you tried to simply dip it in the sauce that it came with.The long wait, extremely scarce seating and underwhelming potato puffs means I probably won't be back any time soon."
1977,"Gregoire is one of those places that I would call a Berkeley staple. Definitely something that you should try, especially if you're only in town for a few days! The menu tends to change monthly, but you can always check their website for the current, up to date menu. They have a daily soup that changes, as you guessed it, daily. I tend to go in a grab the potato puffs and the soup of the day as a meal. The potato puffs are a definite must try item! I like to describe them as fried mashed potato balls, aka heaven in food form. You can add parsley & garlic or parmesan to potato puffs, but each addition costs $2 and the puffs already taste great without the add ons. I have tried the sandwiches and fries in the past and have enjoyed them as well. This place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get a ton of flavor for what you pay.Downside here is the service. It can be very brusque, particularly if the place is packed. I typically order online and then drop by to pick up the food so that I have less interaction with the employees. It also seems to be somewhat faster to order online."
1978,"A Berkeley classic. There can be a line, and food can take a little while to come out, but it is worth it. Only a couple tables outside, so don't count on eating there. Go picnic at a nearby patch of grass! The fried potato balls are a must try. Comes with a olive mayo dipping sauce, so toppings aren't totally necessary, but nice to add. 9 little potato balls in an order, crispy outside with a creamy dreamy interior. Fried chicken sandwich is another signature item that is worth a try. A cute spot to get a picnic lunch!"
