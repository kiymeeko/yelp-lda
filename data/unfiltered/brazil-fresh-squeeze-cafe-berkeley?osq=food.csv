0,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20. After I came back, the cashier quickly recognized me and gave me my order. Definitely enjoy the transparency of the service."
1,"Wow what a great find thanks to yelp. Needed a cheap, filling, fresh meal and this hit all the spots. I loved my bowl with tri tip, sauce, veggies and pita!  It was amazingly tasty and the extra sauces on the tables were a bonus. Highly recommended."
2,I've had this cafe bookmarked forever but never make the trip out to Berkeley. I managed to go on Memorial Day. Food IMO was nothing I would drive an hour for. The service could be improved and the wait was too long. I was looking most forward to the green sauce I see from the pictures here on Yelp. I make my own version of this sauce so I was curious to try theirs. I like spicy sauces so I was unimpressed when I tried Brazil cafe's as the spice level was basically non-existent to me. Although I'm not quite sure if it's meant to be spicy at all. Did enjoy the cheese or cream in the center of the sauce. And for those who love spicy like I do they had a variety of hot sauces. We ordered #84 Pedro's favorite tri-tip sandwich and the meat combo plate. Paid around $25? The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.
3,"Small, but impressive. My cousins and I were looking for a place to eat that was 1. dog friendly and 2. something that had protein. Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe it was! A quick scan of the Yelp reviews had tri-tip highlighted everywhere and that's exactly what we ordered. As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading. I think those must be from a food truck lot. This location only has a handful of tables).MENUOur group ordered different variations of the Tri-tip (Tri-tip bowl, Tri-tip plate, Tri-tip sandwhich). The only difference between the Tri-tip bowl and plate is that the bowl does not have any side veggies, and is a little smaller than the plate. I would recommend getting the plate if you want those extra greens, since just meat + rice can feel a little heavy. The meat itself was lightly flavored, a little chewy, but still very satisfying. I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."
4,"First time trying their meal. I ordered their tri-tip salad and it was surprisingly large portion. They put a variety items into the salad and sides, and everything taste great. The staff was really nice and friendly. They also offer u a free tri-tip dipped in cilantro sauce as free sample. Have to say, their cilantro sauce is amazing. The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."
5,"Brazil Fresh Squeeze Grill's Pedro's Favorite sandwich is now also my favorite.It took several minutes to prepare and serve. The steak inside is legit pieces of good meat. The jalapeños added a kick and the bread was fresh.The Complimentary mango smoothie with your check in was not half-assed just coz it was a freebie.Brazil Fresh Squeeze is a food stand located at the corner of the parking lot of a bike shop but I'm not sure you could actually park at this lot. No worries, there are plenty of street parking available on the streets."
6,"You know that feeling when you're out of food and you're full but you still want more? That's me at Brazil Cafe every single time.Right off the bat, be prepared to wait. The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it. As soon as the mediterranean tri-tip plate was handed to me, the first thing I noticed was how hefty it was. As soon as I opened it, it became clear what was so hefty: a generous helping of rice,  tri-tip, pita, sauce and salad along with the weight of the impending happiness that was about to enter me. The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
7,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food. The staff at the restaurant are friendly, and so are the folks that work here at this location. I discovered that you could order online through yelp24, so do that if you're in a hurry and need to grab and go! Ordering online will save you a bunch of time since they're so popular. This location is closer to campus, so much more convenient. They have a couple of tables and seats outside next to the shack, but they're usually taken. Just head over to campus and find a place to sit outside if it's a nice day and enjoy your yummy food. I got the tri-tip plate, my go to dish, which is probably a go to for many others as well.TL;DR LOVE this place, come and try the tri-tip plate!! (Don't forget to check in on Yelp for their FREE & DELICIOUS mango smoothie!)"
8,"I was looking for a place for lunch in Berkeley when my cousin suddenly remembered this place. She vouched and insisted that the food here is amazing, so I decided that I had to find out for myself.PARKING + AMBIENCEFind street parking around the neighborhood, the cafe is super close to the UC Berkeley campus, so parking can be sparse. The place is a hut located on the side of a bike store parking lot, with parking reserved only for the store customers. Since it's a small hut, there's only a couple of tables placed on the side of the place. The food is all packed into a container, so it's perfect to take to-go.  FOODThe Tri-Tip Plate includes rice, salad, bread, and cilantro garlic sauce. The beef was so tender and juicy! The grilled onions on top of the beef complimented the overall flavor as well. The plate is a huge portion of food, so expect to potentially have leftovers. I didn't finish all bread, the rice and salad was already enough for the base. The cilantro garlic sauce was amazingly flavorful, I mixed it with the hot sauce on the beef, a great combination of sauces for the beef.  Also, don't forget the free mango smoothie when you check-in on Yelp. It's a good refreshment for the big meal. SERVICEThe menu is next to the cashier, so decide on what you want and order right away. They cashier will call on your number when the food is ready for pick up, they will give you the free mango smoothie once you pick up your order.CONCLUSIONNo wonder all the locals rave about this place, it's definitely a UC Berkeley campus favorite and blew my expectations away! No complaints about Brazilian Fresh Squeeze Cafe at all, everything was good; the portions, the price, and the food! It's a must try if you find yourself in the Berkeley area."
9,"Okay, so this business listing is a bit confusing because the pictures posted by the business owner aren't of this location.  This place is a bit bigger than a kiosk and is this tiny shop right along the street.  There's some seating on the side which is great, but a lot of people also seem to take things to go.  The food here is pretty good, I really like the tri tip plate.  The green sauce is fantastic.  FYI, there's a lot of mayo in this so be prepared to feel gross afterward, but it is a tasty meal.  The workers here are friendly enough.  Also, keep in mind that the food takes quite a while to come out here.  Worth a try though if you're out here in Berkeley."
10,Come here for their trip tip sandwich or plate! You will not be disappointed. My bf and I look forward to eating here every time we're in the area. I swear something about their sauce. It's so addicting! And if you love it spicy don't forget to add the habanero hot sauce to your sandwich.
11,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce. Last year, I would come from vallejo to get my mom and plate, and I would keep bringing it to her so that she can get familiar with the sauce and try to replicate it. Although she does a very very very good job at making a mean replica, Brazil cafe still wins lol. Sorry mom. On don't forget! That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"
12,"Amazing, super juicy, tons of flavor tri-tip (I got the Pedro's sandwich, boyfriend got the plate- both amaze). Love the vibe of it being a tiny little shack on the corner with a few outdoor tables. The owner, or whom I believe to be, was super friendly, welcoming all who walked by, giving out samples of delicious meat covered in chimichurri. *Make sure to check into yelp for a free mango smoothie!*"
13,"The tri tip is bonkers, the garlic-cilantro sauce is out of this world, and that mango smoothie they've got is next-level refreshing. If I've got time to spare, I'll always stop by this little gem."
14,"If you're hangry and can't wait, don't come to this location. However, if you are hungry....their portions will satisfy you! NOTE: They have an indoor location 3 blocks away! But everyone likes to come to the ""original"", right? Place is a lot smaller than seen in photos. 5 tables, only about 15 chairs total. Definitely a grab and go place, since it's so closely located to the campus. This place is a two-man show (and 3, if you count Pedro, walking around and cleaning up the tables). Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum. DELICIOUS!!! -Chicken is too dry and skimpy slices. -Cilantro garlic sauce wasn't what I had hoped for....it was a bit too creamy and not enough cilantro taste. 1 tri-tip sandwich // YUM! I love the burst of flavors in this compact sandwich. Plentiful of meat juice, meat and sauces. I would eat two of these if I could...Definitely get this one! Pros:+Despite the long lines, the two guys in the kiosk are working their quickest!+Great menu options. I wanted to try everything!!! Cons:-Ehhh. Not exactly worth it to get their smoothies. Mango smoothie was some type of puree blended with ice...-The SO and I agree the tri-tip was really tough to chew. Not unpleasant, but not what we had entirely expected. Tips/Observations:-Water cups available! Just ask at the front.Everything I had expected and wanted to satisfy my weekly splurge. Holding off on a 5 until I can give a try at their other items..."
15,"Where has this pace been all my life... who knew that a tiny shack on the corner of a Berkeley street would house such yummy food?! Yelp was right on with this one. Don't judge a book by its cover or you'll be missing out on one of the tastiest meals you'll ever have! I recommend asking for extra green sauce (if you're a garlic lover like me). Any season, this spot is sure to satisfy!"
16,"Still the great Brazil fresh café as I remembered it. Still got it! If hungry, go for the plate, meat on rice and salad served with a slathering of the garlic green sauce!"
17,"I'll be honest. I'm not from Berkeley. I'm actually no where near Berkeley. But I make a pit stop in Berkeley just for Brazil cafe!! It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? The menu is filled with delicious Dishes and pro tip: don't leave here without trying the tri tip!!! I get the regular rice bowl and my friend gets the combo plate. Both come with rice (btw what is that rice? Never tasted anything like it), tri tip (or your choice of meat), their amazingggg green sauce, a ball of ricotta cheese, and three slices of bread. The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
18,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
19,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.

I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."
44,"First time trying their meal. I ordered their tri-tip salad and it was surprisingly large portion. They put a variety items into the salad and sides, and everything taste great. The staff was really nice and friendly. They also offer u a free tri-tip dipped in cilantro sauce as free sample. Have to say, their cilantro sauce is amazing. The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."
45,"Brazil Fresh Squeeze Grill's Pedro's Favorite sandwich is now also my favorite.It took several minutes to prepare and serve. The steak inside is legit pieces of good meat. The jalapeños added a kick and the bread was fresh.The Complimentary mango smoothie with your check in was not half-assed just coz it was a freebie.Brazil Fresh Squeeze is a food stand located at the corner of the parking lot of a bike shop but I'm not sure you could actually park at this lot. No worries, there are plenty of street parking available on the streets."
46,"You know that feeling when you're out of food and you're full but you still want more? That's me at Brazil Cafe every single time.Right off the bat, be prepared to wait. The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it. As soon as the mediterranean tri-tip plate was handed to me, the first thing I noticed was how hefty it was. As soon as I opened it, it became clear what was so hefty: a generous helping of rice,  tri-tip, pita, sauce and salad along with the weight of the impending happiness that was about to enter me. The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
47,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food. The staff at the restaurant are friendly, and so are the folks that work here at this location. I discovered that you could order online through yelp24, so do that if you're in a hurry and need to grab and go! Ordering online will save you a bunch of time since they're so popular. This location is closer to campus, so much more convenient. They have a couple of tables and seats outside next to the shack, but they're usually taken. Just head over to campus and find a place to sit outside if it's a nice day and enjoy your yummy food. I got the tri-tip plate, my go to dish, which is probably a go to for many others as well.TL;DR LOVE this place, come and try the tri-tip plate!! (Don't forget to check in on Yelp for their FREE & DELICIOUS mango smoothie!)"
48,"I was looking for a place for lunch in Berkeley when my cousin suddenly remembered this place. She vouched and insisted that the food here is amazing, so I decided that I had to find out for myself.PARKING + AMBIENCEFind street parking around the neighborhood, the cafe is super close to the UC Berkeley campus, so parking can be sparse. The place is a hut located on the side of a bike store parking lot, with parking reserved only for the store customers. Since it's a small hut, there's only a couple of tables placed on the side of the place. The food is all packed into a container, so it's perfect to take to-go.  FOODThe Tri-Tip Plate includes rice, salad, bread, and cilantro garlic sauce. The beef was so tender and juicy! The grilled onions on top of the beef complimented the overall flavor as well. The plate is a huge portion of food, so expect to potentially have leftovers. I didn't finish all bread, the rice and salad was already enough for the base. The cilantro garlic sauce was amazingly flavorful, I mixed it with the hot sauce on the beef, a great combination of sauces for the beef.  Also, don't forget the free mango smoothie when you check-in on Yelp. It's a good refreshment for the big meal. SERVICEThe menu is next to the cashier, so decide on what you want and order right away. They cashier will call on your number when the food is ready for pick up, they will give you the free mango smoothie once you pick up your order.CONCLUSIONNo wonder all the locals rave about this place, it's definitely a UC Berkeley campus favorite and blew my expectations away! No complaints about Brazilian Fresh Squeeze Cafe at all, everything was good; the portions, the price, and the food! It's a must try if you find yourself in the Berkeley area."
49,"Okay, so this business listing is a bit confusing because the pictures posted by the business owner aren't of this location.  This place is a bit bigger than a kiosk and is this tiny shop right along the street.  There's some seating on the side which is great, but a lot of people also seem to take things to go.  The food here is pretty good, I really like the tri tip plate.  The green sauce is fantastic.  FYI, there's a lot of mayo in this so be prepared to feel gross afterward, but it is a tasty meal.  The workers here are friendly enough.  Also, keep in mind that the food takes quite a while to come out here.  Worth a try though if you're out here in Berkeley."
50,Come here for their trip tip sandwich or plate! You will not be disappointed. My bf and I look forward to eating here every time we're in the area. I swear something about their sauce. It's so addicting! And if you love it spicy don't forget to add the habanero hot sauce to your sandwich.
51,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce. Last year, I would come from vallejo to get my mom and plate, and I would keep bringing it to her so that she can get familiar with the sauce and try to replicate it. Although she does a very very very good job at making a mean replica, Brazil cafe still wins lol. Sorry mom. On don't forget! That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"
52,"Amazing, super juicy, tons of flavor tri-tip (I got the Pedro's sandwich, boyfriend got the plate- both amaze). Love the vibe of it being a tiny little shack on the corner with a few outdoor tables. The owner, or whom I believe to be, was super friendly, welcoming all who walked by, giving out samples of delicious meat covered in chimichurri. *Make sure to check into yelp for a free mango smoothie!*"
53,"The tri tip is bonkers, the garlic-cilantro sauce is out of this world, and that mango smoothie they've got is next-level refreshing. If I've got time to spare, I'll always stop by this little gem."
54,"If you're hangry and can't wait, don't come to this location. However, if you are hungry....their portions will satisfy you! NOTE: They have an indoor location 3 blocks away! But everyone likes to come to the ""original"", right? Place is a lot smaller than seen in photos. 5 tables, only about 15 chairs total. Definitely a grab and go place, since it's so closely located to the campus. This place is a two-man show (and 3, if you count Pedro, walking around and cleaning up the tables). Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum. DELICIOUS!!! -Chicken is too dry and skimpy slices. -Cilantro garlic sauce wasn't what I had hoped for....it was a bit too creamy and not enough cilantro taste. 1 tri-tip sandwich // YUM! I love the burst of flavors in this compact sandwich. Plentiful of meat juice, meat and sauces. I would eat two of these if I could...Definitely get this one! Pros:+Despite the long lines, the two guys in the kiosk are working their quickest!+Great menu options. I wanted to try everything!!! Cons:-Ehhh. Not exactly worth it to get their smoothies. Mango smoothie was some type of puree blended with ice...-The SO and I agree the tri-tip was really tough to chew. Not unpleasant, but not what we had entirely expected. Tips/Observations:-Water cups available! Just ask at the front.Everything I had expected and wanted to satisfy my weekly splurge. Holding off on a 5 until I can give a try at their other items..."
55,"Where has this pace been all my life... who knew that a tiny shack on the corner of a Berkeley street would house such yummy food?! Yelp was right on with this one. Don't judge a book by its cover or you'll be missing out on one of the tastiest meals you'll ever have! I recommend asking for extra green sauce (if you're a garlic lover like me). Any season, this spot is sure to satisfy!"
56,"Still the great Brazil fresh café as I remembered it. Still got it! If hungry, go for the plate, meat on rice and salad served with a slathering of the garlic green sauce!"
57,"I'll be honest. I'm not from Berkeley. I'm actually no where near Berkeley. But I make a pit stop in Berkeley just for Brazil cafe!! It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? The menu is filled with delicious Dishes and pro tip: don't leave here without trying the tri tip!!! I get the regular rice bowl and my friend gets the combo plate. Both come with rice (btw what is that rice? Never tasted anything like it), tri tip (or your choice of meat), their amazingggg green sauce, a ball of ricotta cheese, and three slices of bread. The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
58,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
59,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
60,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20. After I came back, the cashier quickly recognized me and gave me my order. Definitely enjoy the transparency of the service."
61,"Wow what a great find thanks to yelp. Needed a cheap, filling, fresh meal and this hit all the spots. I loved my bowl with tri tip, sauce, veggies and pita!  It was amazingly tasty and the extra sauces on the tables were a bonus. Highly recommended."
62,I've had this cafe bookmarked forever but never make the trip out to Berkeley. I managed to go on Memorial Day. Food IMO was nothing I would drive an hour for. The service could be improved and the wait was too long. I was looking most forward to the green sauce I see from the pictures here on Yelp. I make my own version of this sauce so I was curious to try theirs. I like spicy sauces so I was unimpressed when I tried Brazil cafe's as the spice level was basically non-existent to me. Although I'm not quite sure if it's meant to be spicy at all. Did enjoy the cheese or cream in the center of the sauce. And for those who love spicy like I do they had a variety of hot sauces. We ordered #84 Pedro's favorite tri-tip sandwich and the meat combo plate. Paid around $25? The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.
63,"Small, but impressive. My cousins and I were looking for a place to eat that was 1. dog friendly and 2. something that had protein. Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe it was! A quick scan of the Yelp reviews had tri-tip highlighted everywhere and that's exactly what we ordered. As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading.

Just head over to campus and find a place to sit outside if it's a nice day and enjoy your yummy food. I got the tri-tip plate, my go to dish, which is probably a go to for many others as well.TL;DR LOVE this place, come and try the tri-tip plate!! (Don't forget to check in on Yelp for their FREE & DELICIOUS mango smoothie!)"
88,"I was looking for a place for lunch in Berkeley when my cousin suddenly remembered this place. She vouched and insisted that the food here is amazing, so I decided that I had to find out for myself.PARKING + AMBIENCEFind street parking around the neighborhood, the cafe is super close to the UC Berkeley campus, so parking can be sparse. The place is a hut located on the side of a bike store parking lot, with parking reserved only for the store customers. Since it's a small hut, there's only a couple of tables placed on the side of the place. The food is all packed into a container, so it's perfect to take to-go.  FOODThe Tri-Tip Plate includes rice, salad, bread, and cilantro garlic sauce. The beef was so tender and juicy! The grilled onions on top of the beef complimented the overall flavor as well. The plate is a huge portion of food, so expect to potentially have leftovers. I didn't finish all bread, the rice and salad was already enough for the base. The cilantro garlic sauce was amazingly flavorful, I mixed it with the hot sauce on the beef, a great combination of sauces for the beef.  Also, don't forget the free mango smoothie when you check-in on Yelp. It's a good refreshment for the big meal. SERVICEThe menu is next to the cashier, so decide on what you want and order right away. They cashier will call on your number when the food is ready for pick up, they will give you the free mango smoothie once you pick up your order.CONCLUSIONNo wonder all the locals rave about this place, it's definitely a UC Berkeley campus favorite and blew my expectations away! No complaints about Brazilian Fresh Squeeze Cafe at all, everything was good; the portions, the price, and the food! It's a must try if you find yourself in the Berkeley area."
89,"Okay, so this business listing is a bit confusing because the pictures posted by the business owner aren't of this location.  This place is a bit bigger than a kiosk and is this tiny shop right along the street.  There's some seating on the side which is great, but a lot of people also seem to take things to go.  The food here is pretty good, I really like the tri tip plate.  The green sauce is fantastic.  FYI, there's a lot of mayo in this so be prepared to feel gross afterward, but it is a tasty meal.  The workers here are friendly enough.  Also, keep in mind that the food takes quite a while to come out here.  Worth a try though if you're out here in Berkeley."
90,Come here for their trip tip sandwich or plate! You will not be disappointed. My bf and I look forward to eating here every time we're in the area. I swear something about their sauce. It's so addicting! And if you love it spicy don't forget to add the habanero hot sauce to your sandwich.
91,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce. Last year, I would come from vallejo to get my mom and plate, and I would keep bringing it to her so that she can get familiar with the sauce and try to replicate it. Although she does a very very very good job at making a mean replica, Brazil cafe still wins lol. Sorry mom. On don't forget! That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"
92,"Amazing, super juicy, tons of flavor tri-tip (I got the Pedro's sandwich, boyfriend got the plate- both amaze). Love the vibe of it being a tiny little shack on the corner with a few outdoor tables. The owner, or whom I believe to be, was super friendly, welcoming all who walked by, giving out samples of delicious meat covered in chimichurri. *Make sure to check into yelp for a free mango smoothie!*"
93,"The tri tip is bonkers, the garlic-cilantro sauce is out of this world, and that mango smoothie they've got is next-level refreshing. If I've got time to spare, I'll always stop by this little gem."
94,"If you're hangry and can't wait, don't come to this location. However, if you are hungry....their portions will satisfy you! NOTE: They have an indoor location 3 blocks away! But everyone likes to come to the ""original"", right? Place is a lot smaller than seen in photos. 5 tables, only about 15 chairs total. Definitely a grab and go place, since it's so closely located to the campus. This place is a two-man show (and 3, if you count Pedro, walking around and cleaning up the tables). Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum. DELICIOUS!!! -Chicken is too dry and skimpy slices. -Cilantro garlic sauce wasn't what I had hoped for....it was a bit too creamy and not enough cilantro taste. 1 tri-tip sandwich // YUM! I love the burst of flavors in this compact sandwich. Plentiful of meat juice, meat and sauces. I would eat two of these if I could...Definitely get this one! Pros:+Despite the long lines, the two guys in the kiosk are working their quickest!+Great menu options. I wanted to try everything!!! Cons:-Ehhh. Not exactly worth it to get their smoothies. Mango smoothie was some type of puree blended with ice...-The SO and I agree the tri-tip was really tough to chew. Not unpleasant, but not what we had entirely expected. Tips/Observations:-Water cups available! Just ask at the front.Everything I had expected and wanted to satisfy my weekly splurge. Holding off on a 5 until I can give a try at their other items..."
95,"Where has this pace been all my life... who knew that a tiny shack on the corner of a Berkeley street would house such yummy food?! Yelp was right on with this one. Don't judge a book by its cover or you'll be missing out on one of the tastiest meals you'll ever have! I recommend asking for extra green sauce (if you're a garlic lover like me). Any season, this spot is sure to satisfy!"
96,"Still the great Brazil fresh café as I remembered it. Still got it! If hungry, go for the plate, meat on rice and salad served with a slathering of the garlic green sauce!"
97,"I'll be honest. I'm not from Berkeley. I'm actually no where near Berkeley. But I make a pit stop in Berkeley just for Brazil cafe!! It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? The menu is filled with delicious Dishes and pro tip: don't leave here without trying the tri tip!!! I get the regular rice bowl and my friend gets the combo plate. Both come with rice (btw what is that rice? Never tasted anything like it), tri tip (or your choice of meat), their amazingggg green sauce, a ball of ricotta cheese, and three slices of bread. The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
98,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
99,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
100,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20. After I came back, the cashier quickly recognized me and gave me my order. Definitely enjoy the transparency of the service."
101,"Wow what a great find thanks to yelp. Needed a cheap, filling, fresh meal and this hit all the spots. I loved my bowl with tri tip, sauce, veggies and pita!  It was amazingly tasty and the extra sauces on the tables were a bonus. Highly recommended."
102,I've had this cafe bookmarked forever but never make the trip out to Berkeley. I managed to go on Memorial Day. Food IMO was nothing I would drive an hour for. The service could be improved and the wait was too long. I was looking most forward to the green sauce I see from the pictures here on Yelp. I make my own version of this sauce so I was curious to try theirs. I like spicy sauces so I was unimpressed when I tried Brazil cafe's as the spice level was basically non-existent to me. Although I'm not quite sure if it's meant to be spicy at all. Did enjoy the cheese or cream in the center of the sauce. And for those who love spicy like I do they had a variety of hot sauces. We ordered #84 Pedro's favorite tri-tip sandwich and the meat combo plate. Paid around $25? The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.
103,"Small, but impressive. My cousins and I were looking for a place to eat that was 1. dog friendly and 2. something that had protein. Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe it was! A quick scan of the Yelp reviews had tri-tip highlighted everywhere and that's exactly what we ordered. As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading. I think those must be from a food truck lot. This location only has a handful of tables).MENUOur group ordered different variations of the Tri-tip (Tri-tip bowl, Tri-tip plate, Tri-tip sandwhich). The only difference between the Tri-tip bowl and plate is that the bowl does not have any side veggies, and is a little smaller than the plate. I would recommend getting the plate if you want those extra greens, since just meat + rice can feel a little heavy. The meat itself was lightly flavored, a little chewy, but still very satisfying. I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."
104,"First time trying their meal. I ordered their tri-tip salad and it was surprisingly large portion. They put a variety items into the salad and sides, and everything taste great. The staff was really nice and friendly. They also offer u a free tri-tip dipped in cilantro sauce as free sample. Have to say, their cilantro sauce is amazing. The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."
105,"Brazil Fresh Squeeze Grill's Pedro's Favorite sandwich is now also my favorite.It took several minutes to prepare and serve. The steak inside is legit pieces of good meat. The jalapeños added a kick and the bread was fresh.The Complimentary mango smoothie with your check in was not half-assed just coz it was a freebie.Brazil Fresh Squeeze is a food stand located at the corner of the parking lot of a bike shop but I'm not sure you could actually park at this lot. No worries, there are plenty of street parking available on the streets."
106,"You know that feeling when you're out of food and you're full but you still want more? That's me at Brazil Cafe every single time.Right off the bat, be prepared to wait. The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it. As soon as the mediterranean tri-tip plate was handed to me, the first thing I noticed was how hefty it was. As soon as I opened it, it became clear what was so hefty: a generous helping of rice,  tri-tip, pita, sauce and salad along with the weight of the impending happiness that was about to enter me. The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
107,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food.

130,Come here for their trip tip sandwich or plate! You will not be disappointed. My bf and I look forward to eating here every time we're in the area. I swear something about their sauce. It's so addicting! And if you love it spicy don't forget to add the habanero hot sauce to your sandwich.
131,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce. Last year, I would come from vallejo to get my mom and plate, and I would keep bringing it to her so that she can get familiar with the sauce and try to replicate it. Although she does a very very very good job at making a mean replica, Brazil cafe still wins lol. Sorry mom. On don't forget! That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"
132,"Amazing, super juicy, tons of flavor tri-tip (I got the Pedro's sandwich, boyfriend got the plate- both amaze). Love the vibe of it being a tiny little shack on the corner with a few outdoor tables. The owner, or whom I believe to be, was super friendly, welcoming all who walked by, giving out samples of delicious meat covered in chimichurri. *Make sure to check into yelp for a free mango smoothie!*"
133,"The tri tip is bonkers, the garlic-cilantro sauce is out of this world, and that mango smoothie they've got is next-level refreshing. If I've got time to spare, I'll always stop by this little gem."
134,"If you're hangry and can't wait, don't come to this location. However, if you are hungry....their portions will satisfy you! NOTE: They have an indoor location 3 blocks away! But everyone likes to come to the ""original"", right? Place is a lot smaller than seen in photos. 5 tables, only about 15 chairs total. Definitely a grab and go place, since it's so closely located to the campus. This place is a two-man show (and 3, if you count Pedro, walking around and cleaning up the tables). Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum. DELICIOUS!!! -Chicken is too dry and skimpy slices. -Cilantro garlic sauce wasn't what I had hoped for....it was a bit too creamy and not enough cilantro taste. 1 tri-tip sandwich // YUM! I love the burst of flavors in this compact sandwich. Plentiful of meat juice, meat and sauces. I would eat two of these if I could...Definitely get this one! Pros:+Despite the long lines, the two guys in the kiosk are working their quickest!+Great menu options. I wanted to try everything!!! Cons:-Ehhh. Not exactly worth it to get their smoothies. Mango smoothie was some type of puree blended with ice...-The SO and I agree the tri-tip was really tough to chew. Not unpleasant, but not what we had entirely expected. Tips/Observations:-Water cups available! Just ask at the front.Everything I had expected and wanted to satisfy my weekly splurge. Holding off on a 5 until I can give a try at their other items..."
135,"Where has this pace been all my life... who knew that a tiny shack on the corner of a Berkeley street would house such yummy food?! Yelp was right on with this one. Don't judge a book by its cover or you'll be missing out on one of the tastiest meals you'll ever have! I recommend asking for extra green sauce (if you're a garlic lover like me). Any season, this spot is sure to satisfy!"
136,"Still the great Brazil fresh café as I remembered it. Still got it! If hungry, go for the plate, meat on rice and salad served with a slathering of the garlic green sauce!"
137,"I'll be honest. I'm not from Berkeley. I'm actually no where near Berkeley. But I make a pit stop in Berkeley just for Brazil cafe!! It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? The menu is filled with delicious Dishes and pro tip: don't leave here without trying the tri tip!!! I get the regular rice bowl and my friend gets the combo plate. Both come with rice (btw what is that rice? Never tasted anything like it), tri tip (or your choice of meat), their amazingggg green sauce, a ball of ricotta cheese, and three slices of bread. The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
138,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
139,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
140,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20. After I came back, the cashier quickly recognized me and gave me my order. Definitely enjoy the transparency of the service."
141,"Wow what a great find thanks to yelp. Needed a cheap, filling, fresh meal and this hit all the spots. I loved my bowl with tri tip, sauce, veggies and pita!  It was amazingly tasty and the extra sauces on the tables were a bonus. Highly recommended."
142,I've had this cafe bookmarked forever but never make the trip out to Berkeley. I managed to go on Memorial Day. Food IMO was nothing I would drive an hour for. The service could be improved and the wait was too long. I was looking most forward to the green sauce I see from the pictures here on Yelp. I make my own version of this sauce so I was curious to try theirs. I like spicy sauces so I was unimpressed when I tried Brazil cafe's as the spice level was basically non-existent to me. Although I'm not quite sure if it's meant to be spicy at all. Did enjoy the cheese or cream in the center of the sauce. And for those who love spicy like I do they had a variety of hot sauces. We ordered #84 Pedro's favorite tri-tip sandwich and the meat combo plate. Paid around $25? The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.
143,"Small, but impressive. My cousins and I were looking for a place to eat that was 1. dog friendly and 2. something that had protein. Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe it was! A quick scan of the Yelp reviews had tri-tip highlighted everywhere and that's exactly what we ordered. As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading. I think those must be from a food truck lot. This location only has a handful of tables).MENUOur group ordered different variations of the Tri-tip (Tri-tip bowl, Tri-tip plate, Tri-tip sandwhich). The only difference between the Tri-tip bowl and plate is that the bowl does not have any side veggies, and is a little smaller than the plate. I would recommend getting the plate if you want those extra greens, since just meat + rice can feel a little heavy. The meat itself was lightly flavored, a little chewy, but still very satisfying. I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."
144,"First time trying their meal. I ordered their tri-tip salad and it was surprisingly large portion. They put a variety items into the salad and sides, and everything taste great. The staff was really nice and friendly. They also offer u a free tri-tip dipped in cilantro sauce as free sample. Have to say, their cilantro sauce is amazing. The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."
145,"Brazil Fresh Squeeze Grill's Pedro's Favorite sandwich is now also my favorite.It took several minutes to prepare and serve. The steak inside is legit pieces of good meat. The jalapeños added a kick and the bread was fresh.The Complimentary mango smoothie with your check in was not half-assed just coz it was a freebie.Brazil Fresh Squeeze is a food stand located at the corner of the parking lot of a bike shop but I'm not sure you could actually park at this lot. No worries, there are plenty of street parking available on the streets."
146,"You know that feeling when you're out of food and you're full but you still want more? That's me at Brazil Cafe every single time.Right off the bat, be prepared to wait. The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it. As soon as the mediterranean tri-tip plate was handed to me, the first thing I noticed was how hefty it was. As soon as I opened it, it became clear what was so hefty: a generous helping of rice,  tri-tip, pita, sauce and salad along with the weight of the impending happiness that was about to enter me. The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
147,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food. The staff at the restaurant are friendly, and so are the folks that work here at this location. I discovered that you could order online through yelp24, so do that if you're in a hurry and need to grab and go! Ordering online will save you a bunch of time since they're so popular. This location is closer to campus, so much more convenient. They have a couple of tables and seats outside next to the shack, but they're usually taken. Just head over to campus and find a place to sit outside if it's a nice day and enjoy your yummy food. I got the tri-tip plate, my go to dish, which is probably a go to for many others as well.TL;DR LOVE this place, come and try the tri-tip plate!! (Don't forget to check in on Yelp for their FREE & DELICIOUS mango smoothie!)"

She vouched and insisted that the food here is amazing, so I decided that I had to find out for myself.PARKING + AMBIENCEFind street parking around the neighborhood, the cafe is super close to the UC Berkeley campus, so parking can be sparse. The place is a hut located on the side of a bike store parking lot, with parking reserved only for the store customers.

The food is all packed into a container, so it's perfect to take to-go.  FOODThe Tri-Tip Plate includes rice, salad, bread, and cilantro garlic sauce. The beef was so tender and juicy! The grilled onions on top of the beef complimented the overall flavor as well. The plate is a huge portion of food, so expect to potentially have leftovers. I didn't finish all bread, the rice and salad was already enough for the base. The cilantro garlic sauce was amazingly flavorful, I mixed it with the hot sauce on the beef, a great combination of sauces for the beef.  Also, don't forget the free mango smoothie when you check-in on Yelp. It's a good refreshment for the big meal. SERVICEThe menu is next to the cashier, so decide on what you want and order right away. They cashier will call on your number when the food is ready for pick up, they will give you the free mango smoothie once you pick up your order.CONCLUSIONNo wonder all the locals rave about this place, it's definitely a UC Berkeley campus favorite and blew my expectations away!

Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum. DELICIOUS!!! -Chicken is too dry and skimpy slices. -Cilantro garlic sauce wasn't what I had hoped for....it was a bit too creamy and not enough cilantro taste. 1 tri-tip sandwich // YUM! I love the burst of flavors in this compact sandwich. Plentiful of meat juice, meat and sauces. I would eat two of these if I could...Definitely get this one! Pros:+Despite the long lines, the two guys in the kiosk are working their quickest!+Great menu options. I wanted to try everything!!! Cons:-Ehhh. Not exactly worth it to get their smoothies. Mango smoothie was some type of puree blended with ice...-The SO and I agree the tri-tip was really tough to chew. Not unpleasant, but not what we had entirely expected. Tips/Observations:-Water cups available! Just ask at the front.Everything I had expected and wanted to satisfy my weekly splurge. Holding off on a 5 until I can give a try at their other items..."
175,"Where has this pace been all my life... who knew that a tiny shack on the corner of a Berkeley street would house such yummy food?! Yelp was right on with this one. Don't judge a book by its cover or you'll be missing out on one of the tastiest meals you'll ever have! I recommend asking for extra green sauce (if you're a garlic lover like me). Any season, this spot is sure to satisfy!"
176,"Still the great Brazil fresh café as I remembered it. Still got it! If hungry, go for the plate, meat on rice and salad served with a slathering of the garlic green sauce!"
177,"I'll be honest. I'm not from Berkeley. I'm actually no where near Berkeley. But I make a pit stop in Berkeley just for Brazil cafe!! It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? The menu is filled with delicious Dishes and pro tip: don't leave here without trying the tri tip!!! I get the regular rice bowl and my friend gets the combo plate. Both come with rice (btw what is that rice? Never tasted anything like it), tri tip (or your choice of meat), their amazingggg green sauce, a ball of ricotta cheese, and three slices of bread. The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
178,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
179,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
180,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20. After I came back, the cashier quickly recognized me and gave me my order. Definitely enjoy the transparency of the service."
181,"Wow what a great find thanks to yelp. Needed a cheap, filling, fresh meal and this hit all the spots. I loved my bowl with tri tip, sauce, veggies and pita!  It was amazingly tasty and the extra sauces on the tables were a bonus. Highly recommended."
182,I've had this cafe bookmarked forever but never make the trip out to Berkeley. I managed to go on Memorial Day. Food IMO was nothing I would drive an hour for. The service could be improved and the wait was too long. I was looking most forward to the green sauce I see from the pictures here on Yelp. I make my own version of this sauce so I was curious to try theirs. I like spicy sauces so I was unimpressed when I tried Brazil cafe's as the spice level was basically non-existent to me. Although I'm not quite sure if it's meant to be spicy at all. Did enjoy the cheese or cream in the center of the sauce. And for those who love spicy like I do they had a variety of hot sauces. We ordered #84 Pedro's favorite tri-tip sandwich and the meat combo plate. Paid around $25? The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.
183,"Small, but impressive. My cousins and I were looking for a place to eat that was 1. dog friendly and 2. something that had protein. Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe it was! A quick scan of the Yelp reviews had tri-tip highlighted everywhere and that's exactly what we ordered. As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading. I think those must be from a food truck lot. This location only has a handful of tables).MENUOur group ordered different variations of the Tri-tip (Tri-tip bowl, Tri-tip plate, Tri-tip sandwhich). The only difference between the Tri-tip bowl and plate is that the bowl does not have any side veggies, and is a little smaller than the plate. I would recommend getting the plate if you want those extra greens, since just meat + rice can feel a little heavy. The meat itself was lightly flavored, a little chewy, but still very satisfying. I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."
184,"First time trying their meal. I ordered their tri-tip salad and it was surprisingly large portion. They put a variety items into the salad and sides, and everything taste great. The staff was really nice and friendly. They also offer u a free tri-tip dipped in cilantro sauce as free sample. Have to say, their cilantro sauce is amazing. The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."
185,"Brazil Fresh Squeeze Grill's Pedro's Favorite sandwich is now also my favorite.It took several minutes to prepare and serve. The steak inside is legit pieces of good meat. The jalapeños added a kick and the bread was fresh.The Complimentary mango smoothie with your check in was not half-assed just coz it was a freebie.Brazil Fresh Squeeze is a food stand located at the corner of the parking lot of a bike shop but I'm not sure you could actually park at this lot. No worries, there are plenty of street parking available on the streets."
186,"You know that feeling when you're out of food and you're full but you still want more? That's me at Brazil Cafe every single time.Right off the bat, be prepared to wait. The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it. As soon as the mediterranean tri-tip plate was handed to me, the first thing I noticed was how hefty it was. As soon as I opened it, it became clear what was so hefty: a generous helping of rice,  tri-tip, pita, sauce and salad along with the weight of the impending happiness that was about to enter me. The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
187,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food. The staff at the restaurant are friendly, and so are the folks that work here at this location. I discovered that you could order online through yelp24, so do that if you're in a hurry and need to grab and go! Ordering online will save you a bunch of time since they're so popular. This location is closer to campus, so much more convenient. They have a couple of tables and seats outside next to the shack, but they're usually taken. Just head over to campus and find a place to sit outside if it's a nice day and enjoy your yummy food. I got the tri-tip plate, my go to dish, which is probably a go to for many others as well.TL;DR LOVE this place, come and try the tri-tip plate!! (Don't forget to check in on Yelp for their FREE & DELICIOUS mango smoothie!)"
188,"I was looking for a place for lunch in Berkeley when my cousin suddenly remembered this place. She vouched and insisted that the food here is amazing, so I decided that I had to find out for myself.PARKING + AMBIENCEFind street parking around the neighborhood, the cafe is super close to the UC Berkeley campus, so parking can be sparse. The place is a hut located on the side of a bike store parking lot, with parking reserved only for the store customers. Since it's a small hut, there's only a couple of tables placed on the side of the place. The food is all packed into a container, so it's perfect to take to-go.  FOODThe Tri-Tip Plate includes rice, salad, bread, and cilantro garlic sauce. The beef was so tender and juicy! The grilled onions on top of the beef complimented the overall flavor as well. The plate is a huge portion of food, so expect to potentially have leftovers. I didn't finish all bread, the rice and salad was already enough for the base. The cilantro garlic sauce was amazingly flavorful, I mixed it with the hot sauce on the beef, a great combination of sauces for the beef.  Also, don't forget the free mango smoothie when you check-in on Yelp. It's a good refreshment for the big meal. SERVICEThe menu is next to the cashier, so decide on what you want and order right away. They cashier will call on your number when the food is ready for pick up, they will give you the free mango smoothie once you pick up your order.CONCLUSIONNo wonder all the locals rave about this place, it's definitely a UC Berkeley campus favorite and blew my expectations away! No complaints about Brazilian Fresh Squeeze Cafe at all, everything was good; the portions, the price, and the food! It's a must try if you find yourself in the Berkeley area."
189,"Okay, so this business listing is a bit confusing because the pictures posted by the business owner aren't of this location.  This place is a bit bigger than a kiosk and is this tiny shop right along the street.  There's some seating on the side which is great, but a lot of people also seem to take things to go.  The food here is pretty good, I really like the tri tip plate.  The green sauce is fantastic.  FYI, there's a lot of mayo in this so be prepared to feel gross afterward, but it is a tasty meal.  The workers here are friendly enough.  Also, keep in mind that the food takes quite a while to come out here.  Worth a try though if you're out here in Berkeley."
190,Come here for their trip tip sandwich or plate! You will not be disappointed. My bf and I look forward to eating here every time we're in the area. I swear something about their sauce. It's so addicting! And if you love it spicy don't forget to add the habanero hot sauce to your sandwich.
191,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce. Last year, I would come from vallejo to get my mom and plate, and I would keep bringing it to her so that she can get familiar with the sauce and try to replicate it. Although she does a very very very good job at making a mean replica, Brazil cafe still wins lol. Sorry mom. On don't forget! That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"
192,"Amazing, super juicy, tons of flavor tri-tip (I got the Pedro's sandwich, boyfriend got the plate- both amaze). Love the vibe of it being a tiny little shack on the corner with a few outdoor tables. The owner, or whom I believe to be, was super friendly, welcoming all who walked by, giving out samples of delicious meat covered in chimichurri. *Make sure to check into yelp for a free mango smoothie!*"

The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
218,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
219,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
220,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20. After I came back, the cashier quickly recognized me and gave me my order. Definitely enjoy the transparency of the service."
221,"Wow what a great find thanks to yelp. Needed a cheap, filling, fresh meal and this hit all the spots. I loved my bowl with tri tip, sauce, veggies and pita!  It was amazingly tasty and the extra sauces on the tables were a bonus. Highly recommended."
222,I've had this cafe bookmarked forever but never make the trip out to Berkeley. I managed to go on Memorial Day. Food IMO was nothing I would drive an hour for. The service could be improved and the wait was too long. I was looking most forward to the green sauce I see from the pictures here on Yelp. I make my own version of this sauce so I was curious to try theirs. I like spicy sauces so I was unimpressed when I tried Brazil cafe's as the spice level was basically non-existent to me. Although I'm not quite sure if it's meant to be spicy at all. Did enjoy the cheese or cream in the center of the sauce. And for those who love spicy like I do they had a variety of hot sauces. We ordered #84 Pedro's favorite tri-tip sandwich and the meat combo plate. Paid around $25? The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.
223,"Small, but impressive. My cousins and I were looking for a place to eat that was 1. dog friendly and 2. something that had protein. Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe it was! A quick scan of the Yelp reviews had tri-tip highlighted everywhere and that's exactly what we ordered. As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading. I think those must be from a food truck lot. This location only has a handful of tables).MENUOur group ordered different variations of the Tri-tip (Tri-tip bowl, Tri-tip plate, Tri-tip sandwhich). The only difference between the Tri-tip bowl and plate is that the bowl does not have any side veggies, and is a little smaller than the plate. I would recommend getting the plate if you want those extra greens, since just meat + rice can feel a little heavy. The meat itself was lightly flavored, a little chewy, but still very satisfying. I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."
224,"First time trying their meal. I ordered their tri-tip salad and it was surprisingly large portion. They put a variety items into the salad and sides, and everything taste great. The staff was really nice and friendly. They also offer u a free tri-tip dipped in cilantro sauce as free sample. Have to say, their cilantro sauce is amazing. The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."
225,"Brazil Fresh Squeeze Grill's Pedro's Favorite sandwich is now also my favorite.It took several minutes to prepare and serve. The steak inside is legit pieces of good meat. The jalapeños added a kick and the bread was fresh.The Complimentary mango smoothie with your check in was not half-assed just coz it was a freebie.Brazil Fresh Squeeze is a food stand located at the corner of the parking lot of a bike shop but I'm not sure you could actually park at this lot. No worries, there are plenty of street parking available on the streets."
226,"You know that feeling when you're out of food and you're full but you still want more? That's me at Brazil Cafe every single time.Right off the bat, be prepared to wait. The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it. As soon as the mediterranean tri-tip plate was handed to me, the first thing I noticed was how hefty it was. As soon as I opened it, it became clear what was so hefty: a generous helping of rice,  tri-tip, pita, sauce and salad along with the weight of the impending happiness that was about to enter me. The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
227,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food. The staff at the restaurant are friendly, and so are the folks that work here at this location. I discovered that you could order online through yelp24, so do that if you're in a hurry and need to grab and go! Ordering online will save you a bunch of time since they're so popular. This location is closer to campus, so much more convenient. They have a couple of tables and seats outside next to the shack, but they're usually taken. Just head over to campus and find a place to sit outside if it's a nice day and enjoy your yummy food. I got the tri-tip plate, my go to dish, which is probably a go to for many others as well.TL;DR LOVE this place, come and try the tri-tip plate!! (Don't forget to check in on Yelp for their FREE & DELICIOUS mango smoothie!)"
228,"I was looking for a place for lunch in Berkeley when my cousin suddenly remembered this place. She vouched and insisted that the food here is amazing, so I decided that I had to find out for myself.PARKING + AMBIENCEFind street parking around the neighborhood, the cafe is super close to the UC Berkeley campus, so parking can be sparse. The place is a hut located on the side of a bike store parking lot, with parking reserved only for the store customers. Since it's a small hut, there's only a couple of tables placed on the side of the place. The food is all packed into a container, so it's perfect to take to-go.  FOODThe Tri-Tip Plate includes rice, salad, bread, and cilantro garlic sauce. The beef was so tender and juicy! The grilled onions on top of the beef complimented the overall flavor as well. The plate is a huge portion of food, so expect to potentially have leftovers. I didn't finish all bread, the rice and salad was already enough for the base. The cilantro garlic sauce was amazingly flavorful, I mixed it with the hot sauce on the beef, a great combination of sauces for the beef.  Also, don't forget the free mango smoothie when you check-in on Yelp. It's a good refreshment for the big meal. SERVICEThe menu is next to the cashier, so decide on what you want and order right away. They cashier will call on your number when the food is ready for pick up, they will give you the free mango smoothie once you pick up your order.CONCLUSIONNo wonder all the locals rave about this place, it's definitely a UC Berkeley campus favorite and blew my expectations away! No complaints about Brazilian Fresh Squeeze Cafe at all, everything was good; the portions, the price, and the food! It's a must try if you find yourself in the Berkeley area."
229,"Okay, so this business listing is a bit confusing because the pictures posted by the business owner aren't of this location.  This place is a bit bigger than a kiosk and is this tiny shop right along the street.  There's some seating on the side which is great, but a lot of people also seem to take things to go.  The food here is pretty good, I really like the tri tip plate.  The green sauce is fantastic.  FYI, there's a lot of mayo in this so be prepared to feel gross afterward, but it is a tasty meal.  The workers here are friendly enough.  Also, keep in mind that the food takes quite a while to come out here.  Worth a try though if you're out here in Berkeley."
230,Come here for their trip tip sandwich or plate! You will not be disappointed. My bf and I look forward to eating here every time we're in the area. I swear something about their sauce. It's so addicting! And if you love it spicy don't forget to add the habanero hot sauce to your sandwich.
231,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce. Last year, I would come from vallejo to get my mom and plate, and I would keep bringing it to her so that she can get familiar with the sauce and try to replicate it. Although she does a very very very good job at making a mean replica, Brazil cafe still wins lol. Sorry mom. On don't forget! That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"
232,"Amazing, super juicy, tons of flavor tri-tip (I got the Pedro's sandwich, boyfriend got the plate- both amaze). Love the vibe of it being a tiny little shack on the corner with a few outdoor tables. The owner, or whom I believe to be, was super friendly, welcoming all who walked by, giving out samples of delicious meat covered in chimichurri. *Make sure to check into yelp for a free mango smoothie!*"
233,"The tri tip is bonkers, the garlic-cilantro sauce is out of this world, and that mango smoothie they've got is next-level refreshing. If I've got time to spare, I'll always stop by this little gem."
234,"If you're hangry and can't wait, don't come to this location. However, if you are hungry....their portions will satisfy you! NOTE: They have an indoor location 3 blocks away! But everyone likes to come to the ""original"", right? Place is a lot smaller than seen in photos. 5 tables, only about 15 chairs total. Definitely a grab and go place, since it's so closely located to the campus. This place is a two-man show (and 3, if you count Pedro, walking around and cleaning up the tables). Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum. DELICIOUS!!! -Chicken is too dry and skimpy slices. -Cilantro garlic sauce wasn't what I had hoped for....it was a bit too creamy and not enough cilantro taste. 1 tri-tip sandwich // YUM! I love the burst of flavors in this compact sandwich. Plentiful of meat juice, meat and sauces. I would eat two of these if I could...Definitely get this one! Pros:+Despite the long lines, the two guys in the kiosk are working their quickest!+Great menu options. I wanted to try everything!!! Cons:-Ehhh. Not exactly worth it to get their smoothies. Mango smoothie was some type of puree blended with ice...-The SO and I agree the tri-tip was really tough to chew. Not unpleasant, but not what we had entirely expected. Tips/Observations:-Water cups available! Just ask at the front.Everything I had expected and wanted to satisfy my weekly splurge. Holding off on a 5 until I can give a try at their other items..."
235,"Where has this pace been all my life... who knew that a tiny shack on the corner of a Berkeley street would house such yummy food?! Yelp was right on with this one. Don't judge a book by its cover or you'll be missing out on one of the tastiest meals you'll ever have! I recommend asking for extra green sauce (if you're a garlic lover like me). Any season, this spot is sure to satisfy!"
236,"Still the great Brazil fresh café as I remembered it. Still got it! If hungry, go for the plate, meat on rice and salad served with a slathering of the garlic green sauce!"
237,"I'll be honest. I'm not from Berkeley. I'm actually no where near Berkeley. But I make a pit stop in Berkeley just for Brazil cafe!! It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right?

As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading. I think those must be from a food truck lot. This location only has a handful of tables).MENUOur group ordered different variations of the Tri-tip (Tri-tip bowl, Tri-tip plate, Tri-tip sandwhich). The only difference between the Tri-tip bowl and plate is that the bowl does not have any side veggies, and is a little smaller than the plate. I would recommend getting the plate if you want those extra greens, since just meat + rice can feel a little heavy. The meat itself was lightly flavored, a little chewy, but still very satisfying. I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."
264,"First time trying their meal. I ordered their tri-tip salad and it was surprisingly large portion. They put a variety items into the salad and sides, and everything taste great. The staff was really nice and friendly. They also offer u a free tri-tip dipped in cilantro sauce as free sample. Have to say, their cilantro sauce is amazing. The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."
265,"Brazil Fresh Squeeze Grill's Pedro's Favorite sandwich is now also my favorite.It took several minutes to prepare and serve. The steak inside is legit pieces of good meat. The jalapeños added a kick and the bread was fresh.The Complimentary mango smoothie with your check in was not half-assed just coz it was a freebie.Brazil Fresh Squeeze is a food stand located at the corner of the parking lot of a bike shop but I'm not sure you could actually park at this lot. No worries, there are plenty of street parking available on the streets."
266,"You know that feeling when you're out of food and you're full but you still want more? That's me at Brazil Cafe every single time.Right off the bat, be prepared to wait. The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it. As soon as the mediterranean tri-tip plate was handed to me, the first thing I noticed was how hefty it was. As soon as I opened it, it became clear what was so hefty: a generous helping of rice,  tri-tip, pita, sauce and salad along with the weight of the impending happiness that was about to enter me. The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
267,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food. The staff at the restaurant are friendly, and so are the folks that work here at this location. I discovered that you could order online through yelp24, so do that if you're in a hurry and need to grab and go! Ordering online will save you a bunch of time since they're so popular. This location is closer to campus, so much more convenient. They have a couple of tables and seats outside next to the shack, but they're usually taken. Just head over to campus and find a place to sit outside if it's a nice day and enjoy your yummy food. I got the tri-tip plate, my go to dish, which is probably a go to for many others as well.TL;DR LOVE this place, come and try the tri-tip plate!! (Don't forget to check in on Yelp for their FREE & DELICIOUS mango smoothie!)"
268,"I was looking for a place for lunch in Berkeley when my cousin suddenly remembered this place. She vouched and insisted that the food here is amazing, so I decided that I had to find out for myself.PARKING + AMBIENCEFind street parking around the neighborhood, the cafe is super close to the UC Berkeley campus, so parking can be sparse. The place is a hut located on the side of a bike store parking lot, with parking reserved only for the store customers. Since it's a small hut, there's only a couple of tables placed on the side of the place. The food is all packed into a container, so it's perfect to take to-go.  FOODThe Tri-Tip Plate includes rice, salad, bread, and cilantro garlic sauce. The beef was so tender and juicy! The grilled onions on top of the beef complimented the overall flavor as well. The plate is a huge portion of food, so expect to potentially have leftovers. I didn't finish all bread, the rice and salad was already enough for the base. The cilantro garlic sauce was amazingly flavorful, I mixed it with the hot sauce on the beef, a great combination of sauces for the beef.  Also, don't forget the free mango smoothie when you check-in on Yelp. It's a good refreshment for the big meal. SERVICEThe menu is next to the cashier, so decide on what you want and order right away. They cashier will call on your number when the food is ready for pick up, they will give you the free mango smoothie once you pick up your order.CONCLUSIONNo wonder all the locals rave about this place, it's definitely a UC Berkeley campus favorite and blew my expectations away! No complaints about Brazilian Fresh Squeeze Cafe at all, everything was good; the portions, the price, and the food! It's a must try if you find yourself in the Berkeley area."
269,"Okay, so this business listing is a bit confusing because the pictures posted by the business owner aren't of this location.  This place is a bit bigger than a kiosk and is this tiny shop right along the street.  There's some seating on the side which is great, but a lot of people also seem to take things to go.  The food here is pretty good, I really like the tri tip plate.  The green sauce is fantastic.  FYI, there's a lot of mayo in this so be prepared to feel gross afterward, but it is a tasty meal.  The workers here are friendly enough.  Also, keep in mind that the food takes quite a while to come out here.  Worth a try though if you're out here in Berkeley."
270,Come here for their trip tip sandwich or plate! You will not be disappointed. My bf and I look forward to eating here every time we're in the area. I swear something about their sauce. It's so addicting! And if you love it spicy don't forget to add the habanero hot sauce to your sandwich.
271,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce. Last year, I would come from vallejo to get my mom and plate, and I would keep bringing it to her so that she can get familiar with the sauce and try to replicate it. Although she does a very very very good job at making a mean replica, Brazil cafe still wins lol. Sorry mom. On don't forget! That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"
272,"Amazing, super juicy, tons of flavor tri-tip (I got the Pedro's sandwich, boyfriend got the plate- both amaze). Love the vibe of it being a tiny little shack on the corner with a few outdoor tables. The owner, or whom I believe to be, was super friendly, welcoming all who walked by, giving out samples of delicious meat covered in chimichurri. *Make sure to check into yelp for a free mango smoothie!*"
273,"The tri tip is bonkers, the garlic-cilantro sauce is out of this world, and that mango smoothie they've got is next-level refreshing. If I've got time to spare, I'll always stop by this little gem."
274,"If you're hangry and can't wait, don't come to this location. However, if you are hungry....their portions will satisfy you! NOTE: They have an indoor location 3 blocks away! But everyone likes to come to the ""original"", right? Place is a lot smaller than seen in photos. 5 tables, only about 15 chairs total. Definitely a grab and go place, since it's so closely located to the campus. This place is a two-man show (and 3, if you count Pedro, walking around and cleaning up the tables). Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum. DELICIOUS!!! -Chicken is too dry and skimpy slices. -Cilantro garlic sauce wasn't what I had hoped for....it was a bit too creamy and not enough cilantro taste. 1 tri-tip sandwich // YUM! I love the burst of flavors in this compact sandwich. Plentiful of meat juice, meat and sauces. I would eat two of these if I could...Definitely get this one! Pros:+Despite the long lines, the two guys in the kiosk are working their quickest!+Great menu options. I wanted to try everything!!! Cons:-Ehhh. Not exactly worth it to get their smoothies. Mango smoothie was some type of puree blended with ice...-The SO and I agree the tri-tip was really tough to chew. Not unpleasant, but not what we had entirely expected. Tips/Observations:-Water cups available! Just ask at the front.Everything I had expected and wanted to satisfy my weekly splurge. Holding off on a 5 until I can give a try at their other items..."
275,"Where has this pace been all my life... who knew that a tiny shack on the corner of a Berkeley street would house such yummy food?! Yelp was right on with this one. Don't judge a book by its cover or you'll be missing out on one of the tastiest meals you'll ever have! I recommend asking for extra green sauce (if you're a garlic lover like me). Any season, this spot is sure to satisfy!"
276,"Still the great Brazil fresh café as I remembered it. Still got it! If hungry, go for the plate, meat on rice and salad served with a slathering of the garlic green sauce!"
277,"I'll be honest. I'm not from Berkeley. I'm actually no where near Berkeley. But I make a pit stop in Berkeley just for Brazil cafe!! It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? The menu is filled with delicious Dishes and pro tip: don't leave here without trying the tri tip!!! I get the regular rice bowl and my friend gets the combo plate. Both come with rice (btw what is that rice? Never tasted anything like it), tri tip (or your choice of meat), their amazingggg green sauce, a ball of ricotta cheese, and three slices of bread. The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
278,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
279,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
280,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20. After I came back, the cashier quickly recognized me and gave me my order. Definitely enjoy the transparency of the service."
281,"Wow what a great find thanks to yelp. Needed a cheap, filling, fresh meal and this hit all the spots. I loved my bowl with tri tip, sauce, veggies and pita!  It was amazingly tasty and the extra sauces on the tables were a bonus. Highly recommended."
282,I've had this cafe bookmarked forever but never make the trip out to Berkeley. I managed to go on Memorial Day. Food IMO was nothing I would drive an hour for. The service could be improved and the wait was too long. I was looking most forward to the green sauce I see from the pictures here on Yelp. I make my own version of this sauce so I was curious to try theirs. I like spicy sauces so I was unimpressed when I tried Brazil cafe's as the spice level was basically non-existent to me. Although I'm not quite sure if it's meant to be spicy at all. Did enjoy the cheese or cream in the center of the sauce. And for those who love spicy like I do they had a variety of hot sauces. We ordered #84 Pedro's favorite tri-tip sandwich and the meat combo plate. Paid around $25? The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.

The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
307,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food. The staff at the restaurant are friendly, and so are the folks that work here at this location. I discovered that you could order online through yelp24, so do that if you're in a hurry and need to grab and go! Ordering online will save you a bunch of time since they're so popular. This location is closer to campus, so much more convenient. They have a couple of tables and seats outside next to the shack, but they're usually taken. Just head over to campus and find a place to sit outside if it's a nice day and enjoy your yummy food. I got the tri-tip plate, my go to dish, which is probably a go to for many others as well.TL;DR LOVE this place, come and try the tri-tip plate!! (Don't forget to check in on Yelp for their FREE & DELICIOUS mango smoothie!)"
308,"I was looking for a place for lunch in Berkeley when my cousin suddenly remembered this place. She vouched and insisted that the food here is amazing, so I decided that I had to find out for myself.PARKING + AMBIENCEFind street parking around the neighborhood, the cafe is super close to the UC Berkeley campus, so parking can be sparse. The place is a hut located on the side of a bike store parking lot, with parking reserved only for the store customers. Since it's a small hut, there's only a couple of tables placed on the side of the place. The food is all packed into a container, so it's perfect to take to-go.  FOODThe Tri-Tip Plate includes rice, salad, bread, and cilantro garlic sauce. The beef was so tender and juicy! The grilled onions on top of the beef complimented the overall flavor as well. The plate is a huge portion of food, so expect to potentially have leftovers. I didn't finish all bread, the rice and salad was already enough for the base. The cilantro garlic sauce was amazingly flavorful, I mixed it with the hot sauce on the beef, a great combination of sauces for the beef.  Also, don't forget the free mango smoothie when you check-in on Yelp. It's a good refreshment for the big meal. SERVICEThe menu is next to the cashier, so decide on what you want and order right away. They cashier will call on your number when the food is ready for pick up, they will give you the free mango smoothie once you pick up your order.CONCLUSIONNo wonder all the locals rave about this place, it's definitely a UC Berkeley campus favorite and blew my expectations away! No complaints about Brazilian Fresh Squeeze Cafe at all, everything was good; the portions, the price, and the food! It's a must try if you find yourself in the Berkeley area."
309,"Okay, so this business listing is a bit confusing because the pictures posted by the business owner aren't of this location.  This place is a bit bigger than a kiosk and is this tiny shop right along the street.  There's some seating on the side which is great, but a lot of people also seem to take things to go.  The food here is pretty good, I really like the tri tip plate.  The green sauce is fantastic.  FYI, there's a lot of mayo in this so be prepared to feel gross afterward, but it is a tasty meal.  The workers here are friendly enough.  Also, keep in mind that the food takes quite a while to come out here.  Worth a try though if you're out here in Berkeley."
310,Come here for their trip tip sandwich or plate! You will not be disappointed. My bf and I look forward to eating here every time we're in the area. I swear something about their sauce. It's so addicting! And if you love it spicy don't forget to add the habanero hot sauce to your sandwich.
311,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce. Last year, I would come from vallejo to get my mom and plate, and I would keep bringing it to her so that she can get familiar with the sauce and try to replicate it. Although she does a very very very good job at making a mean replica, Brazil cafe still wins lol. Sorry mom. On don't forget! That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"
312,"Amazing, super juicy, tons of flavor tri-tip (I got the Pedro's sandwich, boyfriend got the plate- both amaze). Love the vibe of it being a tiny little shack on the corner with a few outdoor tables. The owner, or whom I believe to be, was super friendly, welcoming all who walked by, giving out samples of delicious meat covered in chimichurri. *Make sure to check into yelp for a free mango smoothie!*"
313,"The tri tip is bonkers, the garlic-cilantro sauce is out of this world, and that mango smoothie they've got is next-level refreshing. If I've got time to spare, I'll always stop by this little gem."
314,"If you're hangry and can't wait, don't come to this location. However, if you are hungry....their portions will satisfy you! NOTE: They have an indoor location 3 blocks away! But everyone likes to come to the ""original"", right? Place is a lot smaller than seen in photos. 5 tables, only about 15 chairs total. Definitely a grab and go place, since it's so closely located to the campus. This place is a two-man show (and 3, if you count Pedro, walking around and cleaning up the tables). Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum. DELICIOUS!!! -Chicken is too dry and skimpy slices. -Cilantro garlic sauce wasn't what I had hoped for....it was a bit too creamy and not enough cilantro taste. 1 tri-tip sandwich // YUM! I love the burst of flavors in this compact sandwich. Plentiful of meat juice, meat and sauces. I would eat two of these if I could...Definitely get this one! Pros:+Despite the long lines, the two guys in the kiosk are working their quickest!+Great menu options. I wanted to try everything!!! Cons:-Ehhh. Not exactly worth it to get their smoothies. Mango smoothie was some type of puree blended with ice...-The SO and I agree the tri-tip was really tough to chew. Not unpleasant, but not what we had entirely expected. Tips/Observations:-Water cups available! Just ask at the front.Everything I had expected and wanted to satisfy my weekly splurge. Holding off on a 5 until I can give a try at their other items..."
315,"Where has this pace been all my life... who knew that a tiny shack on the corner of a Berkeley street would house such yummy food?! Yelp was right on with this one. Don't judge a book by its cover or you'll be missing out on one of the tastiest meals you'll ever have! I recommend asking for extra green sauce (if you're a garlic lover like me). Any season, this spot is sure to satisfy!"
316,"Still the great Brazil fresh café as I remembered it. Still got it! If hungry, go for the plate, meat on rice and salad served with a slathering of the garlic green sauce!"
317,"I'll be honest. I'm not from Berkeley. I'm actually no where near Berkeley. But I make a pit stop in Berkeley just for Brazil cafe!! It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? The menu is filled with delicious Dishes and pro tip: don't leave here without trying the tri tip!!! I get the regular rice bowl and my friend gets the combo plate. Both come with rice (btw what is that rice? Never tasted anything like it), tri tip (or your choice of meat), their amazingggg green sauce, a ball of ricotta cheese, and three slices of bread. The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
318,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
319,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
320,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20. After I came back, the cashier quickly recognized me and gave me my order. Definitely enjoy the transparency of the service."
321,"Wow what a great find thanks to yelp. Needed a cheap, filling, fresh meal and this hit all the spots. I loved my bowl with tri tip, sauce, veggies and pita!  It was amazingly tasty and the extra sauces on the tables were a bonus. Highly recommended."
322,I've had this cafe bookmarked forever but never make the trip out to Berkeley. I managed to go on Memorial Day. Food IMO was nothing I would drive an hour for. The service could be improved and the wait was too long. I was looking most forward to the green sauce I see from the pictures here on Yelp. I make my own version of this sauce so I was curious to try theirs. I like spicy sauces so I was unimpressed when I tried Brazil cafe's as the spice level was basically non-existent to me. Although I'm not quite sure if it's meant to be spicy at all. Did enjoy the cheese or cream in the center of the sauce. And for those who love spicy like I do they had a variety of hot sauces. We ordered #84 Pedro's favorite tri-tip sandwich and the meat combo plate. Paid around $25? The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.
323,"Small, but impressive. My cousins and I were looking for a place to eat that was 1. dog friendly and 2. something that had protein. Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe it was! A quick scan of the Yelp reviews had tri-tip highlighted everywhere and that's exactly what we ordered. As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading. I think those must be from a food truck lot. This location only has a handful of tables).MENUOur group ordered different variations of the Tri-tip (Tri-tip bowl, Tri-tip plate, Tri-tip sandwhich). The only difference between the Tri-tip bowl and plate is that the bowl does not have any side veggies, and is a little smaller than the plate. I would recommend getting the plate if you want those extra greens, since just meat + rice can feel a little heavy. The meat itself was lightly flavored, a little chewy, but still very satisfying. I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."
324,"First time trying their meal. I ordered their tri-tip salad and it was surprisingly large portion. They put a variety items into the salad and sides, and everything taste great. The staff was really nice and friendly. They also offer u a free tri-tip dipped in cilantro sauce as free sample. Have to say, their cilantro sauce is amazing. The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."
325,"Brazil Fresh Squeeze Grill's Pedro's Favorite sandwich is now also my favorite.It took several minutes to prepare and serve. The steak inside is legit pieces of good meat. The jalapeños added a kick and the bread was fresh.The Complimentary mango smoothie with your check in was not half-assed just coz it was a freebie.Brazil Fresh Squeeze is a food stand located at the corner of the parking lot of a bike shop but I'm not sure you could actually park at this lot. No worries, there are plenty of street parking available on the streets."
326,"You know that feeling when you're out of food and you're full but you still want more? That's me at Brazil Cafe every single time.Right off the bat, be prepared to wait. The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it.

They cashier will call on your number when the food is ready for pick up, they will give you the free mango smoothie once you pick up your order.CONCLUSIONNo wonder all the locals rave about this place, it's definitely a UC Berkeley campus favorite and blew my expectations away! No complaints about Brazilian Fresh Squeeze Cafe at all, everything was good; the portions, the price, and the food! It's a must try if you find yourself in the Berkeley area."
349,"Okay, so this business listing is a bit confusing because the pictures posted by the business owner aren't of this location.  This place is a bit bigger than a kiosk and is this tiny shop right along the street.  There's some seating on the side which is great, but a lot of people also seem to take things to go.  The food here is pretty good, I really like the tri tip plate.  The green sauce is fantastic.  FYI, there's a lot of mayo in this so be prepared to feel gross afterward, but it is a tasty meal.  The workers here are friendly enough.  Also, keep in mind that the food takes quite a while to come out here.  Worth a try though if you're out here in Berkeley."
350,Come here for their trip tip sandwich or plate! You will not be disappointed. My bf and I look forward to eating here every time we're in the area. I swear something about their sauce. It's so addicting! And if you love it spicy don't forget to add the habanero hot sauce to your sandwich.
351,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce. Last year, I would come from vallejo to get my mom and plate, and I would keep bringing it to her so that she can get familiar with the sauce and try to replicate it. Although she does a very very very good job at making a mean replica, Brazil cafe still wins lol. Sorry mom. On don't forget! That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"
352,"Amazing, super juicy, tons of flavor tri-tip (I got the Pedro's sandwich, boyfriend got the plate- both amaze). Love the vibe of it being a tiny little shack on the corner with a few outdoor tables. The owner, or whom I believe to be, was super friendly, welcoming all who walked by, giving out samples of delicious meat covered in chimichurri. *Make sure to check into yelp for a free mango smoothie!*"
353,"The tri tip is bonkers, the garlic-cilantro sauce is out of this world, and that mango smoothie they've got is next-level refreshing. If I've got time to spare, I'll always stop by this little gem."
354,"If you're hangry and can't wait, don't come to this location. However, if you are hungry....their portions will satisfy you! NOTE: They have an indoor location 3 blocks away! But everyone likes to come to the ""original"", right? Place is a lot smaller than seen in photos. 5 tables, only about 15 chairs total. Definitely a grab and go place, since it's so closely located to the campus. This place is a two-man show (and 3, if you count Pedro, walking around and cleaning up the tables). Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum. DELICIOUS!!! -Chicken is too dry and skimpy slices. -Cilantro garlic sauce wasn't what I had hoped for....it was a bit too creamy and not enough cilantro taste. 1 tri-tip sandwich // YUM! I love the burst of flavors in this compact sandwich. Plentiful of meat juice, meat and sauces. I would eat two of these if I could...Definitely get this one! Pros:+Despite the long lines, the two guys in the kiosk are working their quickest!+Great menu options. I wanted to try everything!!! Cons:-Ehhh. Not exactly worth it to get their smoothies. Mango smoothie was some type of puree blended with ice...-The SO and I agree the tri-tip was really tough to chew. Not unpleasant, but not what we had entirely expected. Tips/Observations:-Water cups available! Just ask at the front.Everything I had expected and wanted to satisfy my weekly splurge. Holding off on a 5 until I can give a try at their other items..."
355,"Where has this pace been all my life... who knew that a tiny shack on the corner of a Berkeley street would house such yummy food?! Yelp was right on with this one. Don't judge a book by its cover or you'll be missing out on one of the tastiest meals you'll ever have! I recommend asking for extra green sauce (if you're a garlic lover like me). Any season, this spot is sure to satisfy!"
356,"Still the great Brazil fresh café as I remembered it. Still got it! If hungry, go for the plate, meat on rice and salad served with a slathering of the garlic green sauce!"
357,"I'll be honest. I'm not from Berkeley. I'm actually no where near Berkeley. But I make a pit stop in Berkeley just for Brazil cafe!! It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? The menu is filled with delicious Dishes and pro tip: don't leave here without trying the tri tip!!! I get the regular rice bowl and my friend gets the combo plate. Both come with rice (btw what is that rice? Never tasted anything like it), tri tip (or your choice of meat), their amazingggg green sauce, a ball of ricotta cheese, and three slices of bread. The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
358,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
359,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
360,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20. After I came back, the cashier quickly recognized me and gave me my order. Definitely enjoy the transparency of the service."
361,"Wow what a great find thanks to yelp. Needed a cheap, filling, fresh meal and this hit all the spots. I loved my bowl with tri tip, sauce, veggies and pita!  It was amazingly tasty and the extra sauces on the tables were a bonus. Highly recommended."
362,I've had this cafe bookmarked forever but never make the trip out to Berkeley. I managed to go on Memorial Day. Food IMO was nothing I would drive an hour for. The service could be improved and the wait was too long. I was looking most forward to the green sauce I see from the pictures here on Yelp. I make my own version of this sauce so I was curious to try theirs. I like spicy sauces so I was unimpressed when I tried Brazil cafe's as the spice level was basically non-existent to me. Although I'm not quite sure if it's meant to be spicy at all. Did enjoy the cheese or cream in the center of the sauce. And for those who love spicy like I do they had a variety of hot sauces. We ordered #84 Pedro's favorite tri-tip sandwich and the meat combo plate. Paid around $25? The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.
363,"Small, but impressive. My cousins and I were looking for a place to eat that was 1. dog friendly and 2. something that had protein. Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe it was! A quick scan of the Yelp reviews had tri-tip highlighted everywhere and that's exactly what we ordered. As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading. I think those must be from a food truck lot. This location only has a handful of tables).MENUOur group ordered different variations of the Tri-tip (Tri-tip bowl, Tri-tip plate, Tri-tip sandwhich). The only difference between the Tri-tip bowl and plate is that the bowl does not have any side veggies, and is a little smaller than the plate. I would recommend getting the plate if you want those extra greens, since just meat + rice can feel a little heavy. The meat itself was lightly flavored, a little chewy, but still very satisfying. I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."
364,"First time trying their meal. I ordered their tri-tip salad and it was surprisingly large portion. They put a variety items into the salad and sides, and everything taste great. The staff was really nice and friendly. They also offer u a free tri-tip dipped in cilantro sauce as free sample. Have to say, their cilantro sauce is amazing. The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."
365,"Brazil Fresh Squeeze Grill's Pedro's Favorite sandwich is now also my favorite.It took several minutes to prepare and serve. The steak inside is legit pieces of good meat. The jalapeños added a kick and the bread was fresh.The Complimentary mango smoothie with your check in was not half-assed just coz it was a freebie.Brazil Fresh Squeeze is a food stand located at the corner of the parking lot of a bike shop but I'm not sure you could actually park at this lot. No worries, there are plenty of street parking available on the streets."
366,"You know that feeling when you're out of food and you're full but you still want more? That's me at Brazil Cafe every single time.Right off the bat, be prepared to wait. The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it. As soon as the mediterranean tri-tip plate was handed to me, the first thing I noticed was how hefty it was. As soon as I opened it, it became clear what was so hefty: a generous helping of rice,  tri-tip, pita, sauce and salad along with the weight of the impending happiness that was about to enter me. The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
367,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food. The staff at the restaurant are friendly, and so are the folks that work here at this location. I discovered that you could order online through yelp24, so do that if you're in a hurry and need to grab and go! Ordering online will save you a bunch of time since they're so popular. This location is closer to campus, so much more convenient. They have a couple of tables and seats outside next to the shack, but they're usually taken. Just head over to campus and find a place to sit outside if it's a nice day and enjoy your yummy food. I got the tri-tip plate, my go to dish, which is probably a go to for many others as well.TL;DR LOVE this place, come and try the tri-tip plate!!

394,"If you're hangry and can't wait, don't come to this location. However, if you are hungry....their portions will satisfy you! NOTE: They have an indoor location 3 blocks away! But everyone likes to come to the ""original"", right? Place is a lot smaller than seen in photos. 5 tables, only about 15 chairs total. Definitely a grab and go place, since it's so closely located to the campus. This place is a two-man show (and 3, if you count Pedro, walking around and cleaning up the tables). Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum. DELICIOUS!!! -Chicken is too dry and skimpy slices. -Cilantro garlic sauce wasn't what I had hoped for....it was a bit too creamy and not enough cilantro taste. 1 tri-tip sandwich // YUM! I love the burst of flavors in this compact sandwich. Plentiful of meat juice, meat and sauces. I would eat two of these if I could...Definitely get this one! Pros:+Despite the long lines, the two guys in the kiosk are working their quickest!+Great menu options. I wanted to try everything!!! Cons:-Ehhh. Not exactly worth it to get their smoothies. Mango smoothie was some type of puree blended with ice...-The SO and I agree the tri-tip was really tough to chew. Not unpleasant, but not what we had entirely expected. Tips/Observations:-Water cups available! Just ask at the front.Everything I had expected and wanted to satisfy my weekly splurge. Holding off on a 5 until I can give a try at their other items..."
395,"Where has this pace been all my life... who knew that a tiny shack on the corner of a Berkeley street would house such yummy food?! Yelp was right on with this one. Don't judge a book by its cover or you'll be missing out on one of the tastiest meals you'll ever have! I recommend asking for extra green sauce (if you're a garlic lover like me). Any season, this spot is sure to satisfy!"
396,"Still the great Brazil fresh café as I remembered it. Still got it! If hungry, go for the plate, meat on rice and salad served with a slathering of the garlic green sauce!"
397,"I'll be honest. I'm not from Berkeley. I'm actually no where near Berkeley. But I make a pit stop in Berkeley just for Brazil cafe!! It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? The menu is filled with delicious Dishes and pro tip: don't leave here without trying the tri tip!!! I get the regular rice bowl and my friend gets the combo plate. Both come with rice (btw what is that rice? Never tasted anything like it), tri tip (or your choice of meat), their amazingggg green sauce, a ball of ricotta cheese, and three slices of bread. The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
398,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
399,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
400,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20. After I came back, the cashier quickly recognized me and gave me my order. Definitely enjoy the transparency of the service."
401,"Wow what a great find thanks to yelp. Needed a cheap, filling, fresh meal and this hit all the spots. I loved my bowl with tri tip, sauce, veggies and pita!  It was amazingly tasty and the extra sauces on the tables were a bonus. Highly recommended."
402,I've had this cafe bookmarked forever but never make the trip out to Berkeley. I managed to go on Memorial Day. Food IMO was nothing I would drive an hour for. The service could be improved and the wait was too long. I was looking most forward to the green sauce I see from the pictures here on Yelp. I make my own version of this sauce so I was curious to try theirs. I like spicy sauces so I was unimpressed when I tried Brazil cafe's as the spice level was basically non-existent to me. Although I'm not quite sure if it's meant to be spicy at all. Did enjoy the cheese or cream in the center of the sauce. And for those who love spicy like I do they had a variety of hot sauces. We ordered #84 Pedro's favorite tri-tip sandwich and the meat combo plate. Paid around $25? The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.
403,"Small, but impressive. My cousins and I were looking for a place to eat that was 1. dog friendly and 2. something that had protein. Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe it was! A quick scan of the Yelp reviews had tri-tip highlighted everywhere and that's exactly what we ordered. As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading. I think those must be from a food truck lot. This location only has a handful of tables).MENUOur group ordered different variations of the Tri-tip (Tri-tip bowl, Tri-tip plate, Tri-tip sandwhich). The only difference between the Tri-tip bowl and plate is that the bowl does not have any side veggies, and is a little smaller than the plate. I would recommend getting the plate if you want those extra greens, since just meat + rice can feel a little heavy. The meat itself was lightly flavored, a little chewy, but still very satisfying. I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."
404,"First time trying their meal. I ordered their tri-tip salad and it was surprisingly large portion. They put a variety items into the salad and sides, and everything taste great. The staff was really nice and friendly. They also offer u a free tri-tip dipped in cilantro sauce as free sample. Have to say, their cilantro sauce is amazing. The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."
405,"Brazil Fresh Squeeze Grill's Pedro's Favorite sandwich is now also my favorite.It took several minutes to prepare and serve. The steak inside is legit pieces of good meat. The jalapeños added a kick and the bread was fresh.The Complimentary mango smoothie with your check in was not half-assed just coz it was a freebie.Brazil Fresh Squeeze is a food stand located at the corner of the parking lot of a bike shop but I'm not sure you could actually park at this lot. No worries, there are plenty of street parking available on the streets."
406,"You know that feeling when you're out of food and you're full but you still want more? That's me at Brazil Cafe every single time.Right off the bat, be prepared to wait. The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it. As soon as the mediterranean tri-tip plate was handed to me, the first thing I noticed was how hefty it was. As soon as I opened it, it became clear what was so hefty: a generous helping of rice,  tri-tip, pita, sauce and salad along with the weight of the impending happiness that was about to enter me. The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
407,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food. The staff at the restaurant are friendly, and so are the folks that work here at this location. I discovered that you could order online through yelp24, so do that if you're in a hurry and need to grab and go! Ordering online will save you a bunch of time since they're so popular. This location is closer to campus, so much more convenient. They have a couple of tables and seats outside next to the shack, but they're usually taken. Just head over to campus and find a place to sit outside if it's a nice day and enjoy your yummy food. I got the tri-tip plate, my go to dish, which is probably a go to for many others as well.TL;DR LOVE this place, come and try the tri-tip plate!! (Don't forget to check in on Yelp for their FREE & DELICIOUS mango smoothie!)"
408,"I was looking for a place for lunch in Berkeley when my cousin suddenly remembered this place. She vouched and insisted that the food here is amazing, so I decided that I had to find out for myself.PARKING + AMBIENCEFind street parking around the neighborhood, the cafe is super close to the UC Berkeley campus, so parking can be sparse. The place is a hut located on the side of a bike store parking lot, with parking reserved only for the store customers. Since it's a small hut, there's only a couple of tables placed on the side of the place. The food is all packed into a container, so it's perfect to take to-go.  FOODThe Tri-Tip Plate includes rice, salad, bread, and cilantro garlic sauce. The beef was so tender and juicy! The grilled onions on top of the beef complimented the overall flavor as well. The plate is a huge portion of food, so expect to potentially have leftovers. I didn't finish all bread, the rice and salad was already enough for the base. The cilantro garlic sauce was amazingly flavorful, I mixed it with the hot sauce on the beef, a great combination of sauces for the beef.  Also, don't forget the free mango smoothie when you check-in on Yelp. It's a good refreshment for the big meal. SERVICEThe menu is next to the cashier, so decide on what you want and order right away. They cashier will call on your number when the food is ready for pick up, they will give you the free mango smoothie once you pick up your order.CONCLUSIONNo wonder all the locals rave about this place, it's definitely a UC Berkeley campus favorite and blew my expectations away! No complaints about Brazilian Fresh Squeeze Cafe at all, everything was good; the portions, the price, and the food! It's a must try if you find yourself in the Berkeley area."
409,"Okay, so this business listing is a bit confusing because the pictures posted by the business owner aren't of this location.  This place is a bit bigger than a kiosk and is this tiny shop right along the street.  There's some seating on the side which is great, but a lot of people also seem to take things to go.  The food here is pretty good, I really like the tri tip plate.  The green sauce is fantastic.  FYI, there's a lot of mayo in this so be prepared to feel gross afterward, but it is a tasty meal.  The workers here are friendly enough.  Also, keep in mind that the food takes quite a while to come out here.  Worth a try though if you're out here in Berkeley."
410,Come here for their trip tip sandwich or plate! You will not be disappointed. My bf and I look forward to eating here every time we're in the area. I swear something about their sauce. It's so addicting! And if you love it spicy don't forget to add the habanero hot sauce to your sandwich.
411,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce. Last year, I would come from vallejo to get my mom and plate, and I would keep bringing it to her so that she can get familiar with the sauce and try to replicate it. Although she does a very very very good job at making a mean replica, Brazil cafe still wins lol. Sorry mom. On don't forget! That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"

It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? The menu is filled with delicious Dishes and pro tip: don't leave here without trying the tri tip!!! I get the regular rice bowl and my friend gets the combo plate. Both come with rice (btw what is that rice? Never tasted anything like it), tri tip (or your choice of meat), their amazingggg green sauce, a ball of ricotta cheese, and three slices of bread. The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
438,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
439,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
440,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20. After I came back, the cashier quickly recognized me and gave me my order. Definitely enjoy the transparency of the service."
441,"Wow what a great find thanks to yelp. Needed a cheap, filling, fresh meal and this hit all the spots. I loved my bowl with tri tip, sauce, veggies and pita!  It was amazingly tasty and the extra sauces on the tables were a bonus. Highly recommended."
442,I've had this cafe bookmarked forever but never make the trip out to Berkeley. I managed to go on Memorial Day. Food IMO was nothing I would drive an hour for. The service could be improved and the wait was too long. I was looking most forward to the green sauce I see from the pictures here on Yelp. I make my own version of this sauce so I was curious to try theirs. I like spicy sauces so I was unimpressed when I tried Brazil cafe's as the spice level was basically non-existent to me. Although I'm not quite sure if it's meant to be spicy at all. Did enjoy the cheese or cream in the center of the sauce. And for those who love spicy like I do they had a variety of hot sauces. We ordered #84 Pedro's favorite tri-tip sandwich and the meat combo plate. Paid around $25? The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.
443,"Small, but impressive. My cousins and I were looking for a place to eat that was 1. dog friendly and 2. something that had protein. Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe it was! A quick scan of the Yelp reviews had tri-tip highlighted everywhere and that's exactly what we ordered. As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading. I think those must be from a food truck lot. This location only has a handful of tables).MENUOur group ordered different variations of the Tri-tip (Tri-tip bowl, Tri-tip plate, Tri-tip sandwhich). The only difference between the Tri-tip bowl and plate is that the bowl does not have any side veggies, and is a little smaller than the plate. I would recommend getting the plate if you want those extra greens, since just meat + rice can feel a little heavy. The meat itself was lightly flavored, a little chewy, but still very satisfying. I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."
444,"First time trying their meal. I ordered their tri-tip salad and it was surprisingly large portion. They put a variety items into the salad and sides, and everything taste great. The staff was really nice and friendly. They also offer u a free tri-tip dipped in cilantro sauce as free sample. Have to say, their cilantro sauce is amazing. The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."
445,"Brazil Fresh Squeeze Grill's Pedro's Favorite sandwich is now also my favorite.It took several minutes to prepare and serve. The steak inside is legit pieces of good meat. The jalapeños added a kick and the bread was fresh.The Complimentary mango smoothie with your check in was not half-assed just coz it was a freebie.Brazil Fresh Squeeze is a food stand located at the corner of the parking lot of a bike shop but I'm not sure you could actually park at this lot. No worries, there are plenty of street parking available on the streets."
446,"You know that feeling when you're out of food and you're full but you still want more? That's me at Brazil Cafe every single time.Right off the bat, be prepared to wait. The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it. As soon as the mediterranean tri-tip plate was handed to me, the first thing I noticed was how hefty it was. As soon as I opened it, it became clear what was so hefty: a generous helping of rice,  tri-tip, pita, sauce and salad along with the weight of the impending happiness that was about to enter me. The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
447,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food. The staff at the restaurant are friendly, and so are the folks that work here at this location. I discovered that you could order online through yelp24, so do that if you're in a hurry and need to grab and go! Ordering online will save you a bunch of time since they're so popular. This location is closer to campus, so much more convenient. They have a couple of tables and seats outside next to the shack, but they're usually taken. Just head over to campus and find a place to sit outside if it's a nice day and enjoy your yummy food. I got the tri-tip plate, my go to dish, which is probably a go to for many others as well.TL;DR LOVE this place, come and try the tri-tip plate!! (Don't forget to check in on Yelp for their FREE & DELICIOUS mango smoothie!)"
448,"I was looking for a place for lunch in Berkeley when my cousin suddenly remembered this place. She vouched and insisted that the food here is amazing, so I decided that I had to find out for myself.PARKING + AMBIENCEFind street parking around the neighborhood, the cafe is super close to the UC Berkeley campus, so parking can be sparse. The place is a hut located on the side of a bike store parking lot, with parking reserved only for the store customers. Since it's a small hut, there's only a couple of tables placed on the side of the place. The food is all packed into a container, so it's perfect to take to-go.  FOODThe Tri-Tip Plate includes rice, salad, bread, and cilantro garlic sauce. The beef was so tender and juicy! The grilled onions on top of the beef complimented the overall flavor as well. The plate is a huge portion of food, so expect to potentially have leftovers. I didn't finish all bread, the rice and salad was already enough for the base. The cilantro garlic sauce was amazingly flavorful, I mixed it with the hot sauce on the beef, a great combination of sauces for the beef.  Also, don't forget the free mango smoothie when you check-in on Yelp. It's a good refreshment for the big meal. SERVICEThe menu is next to the cashier, so decide on what you want and order right away. They cashier will call on your number when the food is ready for pick up, they will give you the free mango smoothie once you pick up your order.CONCLUSIONNo wonder all the locals rave about this place, it's definitely a UC Berkeley campus favorite and blew my expectations away! No complaints about Brazilian Fresh Squeeze Cafe at all, everything was good; the portions, the price, and the food! It's a must try if you find yourself in the Berkeley area."
449,"Okay, so this business listing is a bit confusing because the pictures posted by the business owner aren't of this location.  This place is a bit bigger than a kiosk and is this tiny shop right along the street.  There's some seating on the side which is great, but a lot of people also seem to take things to go.  The food here is pretty good, I really like the tri tip plate.  The green sauce is fantastic.  FYI, there's a lot of mayo in this so be prepared to feel gross afterward, but it is a tasty meal.  The workers here are friendly enough.  Also, keep in mind that the food takes quite a while to come out here.  Worth a try though if you're out here in Berkeley."
450,Come here for their trip tip sandwich or plate! You will not be disappointed. My bf and I look forward to eating here every time we're in the area. I swear something about their sauce. It's so addicting! And if you love it spicy don't forget to add the habanero hot sauce to your sandwich.
451,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce. Last year, I would come from vallejo to get my mom and plate, and I would keep bringing it to her so that she can get familiar with the sauce and try to replicate it. Although she does a very very very good job at making a mean replica, Brazil cafe still wins lol. Sorry mom. On don't forget! That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"
452,"Amazing, super juicy, tons of flavor tri-tip (I got the Pedro's sandwich, boyfriend got the plate- both amaze). Love the vibe of it being a tiny little shack on the corner with a few outdoor tables. The owner, or whom I believe to be, was super friendly, welcoming all who walked by, giving out samples of delicious meat covered in chimichurri. *Make sure to check into yelp for a free mango smoothie!*"
453,"The tri tip is bonkers, the garlic-cilantro sauce is out of this world, and that mango smoothie they've got is next-level refreshing. If I've got time to spare, I'll always stop by this little gem."
454,"If you're hangry and can't wait, don't come to this location. However, if you are hungry....their portions will satisfy you! NOTE: They have an indoor location 3 blocks away! But everyone likes to come to the ""original"", right? Place is a lot smaller than seen in photos. 5 tables, only about 15 chairs total. Definitely a grab and go place, since it's so closely located to the campus. This place is a two-man show (and 3, if you count Pedro, walking around and cleaning up the tables). Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum. DELICIOUS!!! -Chicken is too dry and skimpy slices. -Cilantro garlic sauce wasn't what I had hoped for....it was a bit too creamy and not enough cilantro taste. 1 tri-tip sandwich // YUM! I love the burst of flavors in this compact sandwich. Plentiful of meat juice, meat and sauces. I would eat two of these if I could...Definitely get this one! Pros:+Despite the long lines, the two guys in the kiosk are working their quickest!+Great menu options. I wanted to try everything!!! Cons:-Ehhh. Not exactly worth it to get their smoothies. Mango smoothie was some type of puree blended with ice...-The SO and I agree the tri-tip was really tough to chew. Not unpleasant, but not what we had entirely expected. Tips/Observations:-Water cups available! Just ask at the front.Everything I had expected and wanted to satisfy my weekly splurge. Holding off on a 5 until I can give a try at their other items..."
455,"Where has this pace been all my life... who knew that a tiny shack on the corner of a Berkeley street would house such yummy food?! Yelp was right on with this one. Don't judge a book by its cover or you'll be missing out on one of the tastiest meals you'll ever have! I recommend asking for extra green sauce (if you're a garlic lover like me).

The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.
483,"Small, but impressive. My cousins and I were looking for a place to eat that was 1. dog friendly and 2. something that had protein. Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe it was! A quick scan of the Yelp reviews had tri-tip highlighted everywhere and that's exactly what we ordered. As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading. I think those must be from a food truck lot. This location only has a handful of tables).MENUOur group ordered different variations of the Tri-tip (Tri-tip bowl, Tri-tip plate, Tri-tip sandwhich). The only difference between the Tri-tip bowl and plate is that the bowl does not have any side veggies, and is a little smaller than the plate. I would recommend getting the plate if you want those extra greens, since just meat + rice can feel a little heavy. The meat itself was lightly flavored, a little chewy, but still very satisfying. I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."
484,"First time trying their meal. I ordered their tri-tip salad and it was surprisingly large portion. They put a variety items into the salad and sides, and everything taste great. The staff was really nice and friendly. They also offer u a free tri-tip dipped in cilantro sauce as free sample. Have to say, their cilantro sauce is amazing. The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."
485,"Brazil Fresh Squeeze Grill's Pedro's Favorite sandwich is now also my favorite.It took several minutes to prepare and serve. The steak inside is legit pieces of good meat. The jalapeños added a kick and the bread was fresh.The Complimentary mango smoothie with your check in was not half-assed just coz it was a freebie.Brazil Fresh Squeeze is a food stand located at the corner of the parking lot of a bike shop but I'm not sure you could actually park at this lot. No worries, there are plenty of street parking available on the streets."
486,"You know that feeling when you're out of food and you're full but you still want more? That's me at Brazil Cafe every single time.Right off the bat, be prepared to wait. The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it. As soon as the mediterranean tri-tip plate was handed to me, the first thing I noticed was how hefty it was. As soon as I opened it, it became clear what was so hefty: a generous helping of rice,  tri-tip, pita, sauce and salad along with the weight of the impending happiness that was about to enter me. The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
487,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food. The staff at the restaurant are friendly, and so are the folks that work here at this location. I discovered that you could order online through yelp24, so do that if you're in a hurry and need to grab and go! Ordering online will save you a bunch of time since they're so popular. This location is closer to campus, so much more convenient. They have a couple of tables and seats outside next to the shack, but they're usually taken. Just head over to campus and find a place to sit outside if it's a nice day and enjoy your yummy food. I got the tri-tip plate, my go to dish, which is probably a go to for many others as well.TL;DR LOVE this place, come and try the tri-tip plate!! (Don't forget to check in on Yelp for their FREE & DELICIOUS mango smoothie!)"
488,"I was looking for a place for lunch in Berkeley when my cousin suddenly remembered this place. She vouched and insisted that the food here is amazing, so I decided that I had to find out for myself.PARKING + AMBIENCEFind street parking around the neighborhood, the cafe is super close to the UC Berkeley campus, so parking can be sparse. The place is a hut located on the side of a bike store parking lot, with parking reserved only for the store customers. Since it's a small hut, there's only a couple of tables placed on the side of the place. The food is all packed into a container, so it's perfect to take to-go.  FOODThe Tri-Tip Plate includes rice, salad, bread, and cilantro garlic sauce. The beef was so tender and juicy! The grilled onions on top of the beef complimented the overall flavor as well. The plate is a huge portion of food, so expect to potentially have leftovers. I didn't finish all bread, the rice and salad was already enough for the base. The cilantro garlic sauce was amazingly flavorful, I mixed it with the hot sauce on the beef, a great combination of sauces for the beef.  Also, don't forget the free mango smoothie when you check-in on Yelp. It's a good refreshment for the big meal. SERVICEThe menu is next to the cashier, so decide on what you want and order right away. They cashier will call on your number when the food is ready for pick up, they will give you the free mango smoothie once you pick up your order.CONCLUSIONNo wonder all the locals rave about this place, it's definitely a UC Berkeley campus favorite and blew my expectations away! No complaints about Brazilian Fresh Squeeze Cafe at all, everything was good; the portions, the price, and the food! It's a must try if you find yourself in the Berkeley area."
489,"Okay, so this business listing is a bit confusing because the pictures posted by the business owner aren't of this location.  This place is a bit bigger than a kiosk and is this tiny shop right along the street.  There's some seating on the side which is great, but a lot of people also seem to take things to go.  The food here is pretty good, I really like the tri tip plate.  The green sauce is fantastic.  FYI, there's a lot of mayo in this so be prepared to feel gross afterward, but it is a tasty meal.  The workers here are friendly enough.  Also, keep in mind that the food takes quite a while to come out here.  Worth a try though if you're out here in Berkeley."
490,Come here for their trip tip sandwich or plate! You will not be disappointed. My bf and I look forward to eating here every time we're in the area. I swear something about their sauce. It's so addicting! And if you love it spicy don't forget to add the habanero hot sauce to your sandwich.
491,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce. Last year, I would come from vallejo to get my mom and plate, and I would keep bringing it to her so that she can get familiar with the sauce and try to replicate it. Although she does a very very very good job at making a mean replica, Brazil cafe still wins lol. Sorry mom. On don't forget! That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"
492,"Amazing, super juicy, tons of flavor tri-tip (I got the Pedro's sandwich, boyfriend got the plate- both amaze). Love the vibe of it being a tiny little shack on the corner with a few outdoor tables. The owner, or whom I believe to be, was super friendly, welcoming all who walked by, giving out samples of delicious meat covered in chimichurri. *Make sure to check into yelp for a free mango smoothie!*"
493,"The tri tip is bonkers, the garlic-cilantro sauce is out of this world, and that mango smoothie they've got is next-level refreshing. If I've got time to spare, I'll always stop by this little gem."
494,"If you're hangry and can't wait, don't come to this location. However, if you are hungry....their portions will satisfy you! NOTE: They have an indoor location 3 blocks away! But everyone likes to come to the ""original"", right? Place is a lot smaller than seen in photos. 5 tables, only about 15 chairs total. Definitely a grab and go place, since it's so closely located to the campus. This place is a two-man show (and 3, if you count Pedro, walking around and cleaning up the tables). Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum. DELICIOUS!!! -Chicken is too dry and skimpy slices. -Cilantro garlic sauce wasn't what I had hoped for....it was a bit too creamy and not enough cilantro taste. 1 tri-tip sandwich // YUM! I love the burst of flavors in this compact sandwich. Plentiful of meat juice, meat and sauces. I would eat two of these if I could...Definitely get this one! Pros:+Despite the long lines, the two guys in the kiosk are working their quickest!+Great menu options. I wanted to try everything!!! Cons:-Ehhh. Not exactly worth it to get their smoothies. Mango smoothie was some type of puree blended with ice...-The SO and I agree the tri-tip was really tough to chew. Not unpleasant, but not what we had entirely expected. Tips/Observations:-Water cups available! Just ask at the front.Everything I had expected and wanted to satisfy my weekly splurge. Holding off on a 5 until I can give a try at their other items..."
495,"Where has this pace been all my life... who knew that a tiny shack on the corner of a Berkeley street would house such yummy food?! Yelp was right on with this one. Don't judge a book by its cover or you'll be missing out on one of the tastiest meals you'll ever have! I recommend asking for extra green sauce (if you're a garlic lover like me). Any season, this spot is sure to satisfy!"
496,"Still the great Brazil fresh café as I remembered it. Still got it! If hungry, go for the plate, meat on rice and salad served with a slathering of the garlic green sauce!"
497,"I'll be honest. I'm not from Berkeley. I'm actually no where near Berkeley. But I make a pit stop in Berkeley just for Brazil cafe!! It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? The menu is filled with delicious Dishes and pro tip: don't leave here without trying the tri tip!!! I get the regular rice bowl and my friend gets the combo plate. Both come with rice (btw what is that rice? Never tasted anything like it), tri tip (or your choice of meat), their amazingggg green sauce, a ball of ricotta cheese, and three slices of bread. The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
498,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
499,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
500,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20. After I came back, the cashier quickly recognized me and gave me my order. Definitely enjoy the transparency of the service."
501,"Wow what a great find thanks to yelp. Needed a cheap, filling, fresh meal and this hit all the spots. I loved my bowl with tri tip, sauce, veggies and pita!  It was amazingly tasty and the extra sauces on the tables were a bonus. Highly recommended."
502,I've had this cafe bookmarked forever but never make the trip out to Berkeley. I managed to go on Memorial Day. Food IMO was nothing I would drive an hour for.

The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it. As soon as the mediterranean tri-tip plate was handed to me, the first thing I noticed was how hefty it was. As soon as I opened it, it became clear what was so hefty: a generous helping of rice,  tri-tip, pita, sauce and salad along with the weight of the impending happiness that was about to enter me. The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
527,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food. The staff at the restaurant are friendly, and so are the folks that work here at this location. I discovered that you could order online through yelp24, so do that if you're in a hurry and need to grab and go! Ordering online will save you a bunch of time since they're so popular. This location is closer to campus, so much more convenient. They have a couple of tables and seats outside next to the shack, but they're usually taken. Just head over to campus and find a place to sit outside if it's a nice day and enjoy your yummy food. I got the tri-tip plate, my go to dish, which is probably a go to for many others as well.TL;DR LOVE this place, come and try the tri-tip plate!! (Don't forget to check in on Yelp for their FREE & DELICIOUS mango smoothie!)"
528,"I was looking for a place for lunch in Berkeley when my cousin suddenly remembered this place. She vouched and insisted that the food here is amazing, so I decided that I had to find out for myself.PARKING + AMBIENCEFind street parking around the neighborhood, the cafe is super close to the UC Berkeley campus, so parking can be sparse. The place is a hut located on the side of a bike store parking lot, with parking reserved only for the store customers. Since it's a small hut, there's only a couple of tables placed on the side of the place. The food is all packed into a container, so it's perfect to take to-go.  FOODThe Tri-Tip Plate includes rice, salad, bread, and cilantro garlic sauce. The beef was so tender and juicy! The grilled onions on top of the beef complimented the overall flavor as well. The plate is a huge portion of food, so expect to potentially have leftovers. I didn't finish all bread, the rice and salad was already enough for the base. The cilantro garlic sauce was amazingly flavorful, I mixed it with the hot sauce on the beef, a great combination of sauces for the beef.  Also, don't forget the free mango smoothie when you check-in on Yelp. It's a good refreshment for the big meal. SERVICEThe menu is next to the cashier, so decide on what you want and order right away. They cashier will call on your number when the food is ready for pick up, they will give you the free mango smoothie once you pick up your order.CONCLUSIONNo wonder all the locals rave about this place, it's definitely a UC Berkeley campus favorite and blew my expectations away! No complaints about Brazilian Fresh Squeeze Cafe at all, everything was good; the portions, the price, and the food! It's a must try if you find yourself in the Berkeley area."
529,"Okay, so this business listing is a bit confusing because the pictures posted by the business owner aren't of this location.  This place is a bit bigger than a kiosk and is this tiny shop right along the street.  There's some seating on the side which is great, but a lot of people also seem to take things to go.  The food here is pretty good, I really like the tri tip plate.  The green sauce is fantastic.  FYI, there's a lot of mayo in this so be prepared to feel gross afterward, but it is a tasty meal.  The workers here are friendly enough.  Also, keep in mind that the food takes quite a while to come out here.  Worth a try though if you're out here in Berkeley."
530,Come here for their trip tip sandwich or plate! You will not be disappointed. My bf and I look forward to eating here every time we're in the area. I swear something about their sauce. It's so addicting! And if you love it spicy don't forget to add the habanero hot sauce to your sandwich.
531,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce. Last year, I would come from vallejo to get my mom and plate, and I would keep bringing it to her so that she can get familiar with the sauce and try to replicate it. Although she does a very very very good job at making a mean replica, Brazil cafe still wins lol. Sorry mom. On don't forget! That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"
532,"Amazing, super juicy, tons of flavor tri-tip (I got the Pedro's sandwich, boyfriend got the plate- both amaze). Love the vibe of it being a tiny little shack on the corner with a few outdoor tables. The owner, or whom I believe to be, was super friendly, welcoming all who walked by, giving out samples of delicious meat covered in chimichurri. *Make sure to check into yelp for a free mango smoothie!*"
533,"The tri tip is bonkers, the garlic-cilantro sauce is out of this world, and that mango smoothie they've got is next-level refreshing. If I've got time to spare, I'll always stop by this little gem."
534,"If you're hangry and can't wait, don't come to this location. However, if you are hungry....their portions will satisfy you! NOTE: They have an indoor location 3 blocks away! But everyone likes to come to the ""original"", right? Place is a lot smaller than seen in photos. 5 tables, only about 15 chairs total. Definitely a grab and go place, since it's so closely located to the campus. This place is a two-man show (and 3, if you count Pedro, walking around and cleaning up the tables). Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum. DELICIOUS!!! -Chicken is too dry and skimpy slices. -Cilantro garlic sauce wasn't what I had hoped for....it was a bit too creamy and not enough cilantro taste. 1 tri-tip sandwich // YUM! I love the burst of flavors in this compact sandwich. Plentiful of meat juice, meat and sauces. I would eat two of these if I could...Definitely get this one! Pros:+Despite the long lines, the two guys in the kiosk are working their quickest!+Great menu options. I wanted to try everything!!! Cons:-Ehhh. Not exactly worth it to get their smoothies. Mango smoothie was some type of puree blended with ice...-The SO and I agree the tri-tip was really tough to chew. Not unpleasant, but not what we had entirely expected. Tips/Observations:-Water cups available! Just ask at the front.Everything I had expected and wanted to satisfy my weekly splurge. Holding off on a 5 until I can give a try at their other items..."
535,"Where has this pace been all my life... who knew that a tiny shack on the corner of a Berkeley street would house such yummy food?! Yelp was right on with this one. Don't judge a book by its cover or you'll be missing out on one of the tastiest meals you'll ever have! I recommend asking for extra green sauce (if you're a garlic lover like me). Any season, this spot is sure to satisfy!"
536,"Still the great Brazil fresh café as I remembered it. Still got it! If hungry, go for the plate, meat on rice and salad served with a slathering of the garlic green sauce!"
537,"I'll be honest. I'm not from Berkeley. I'm actually no where near Berkeley. But I make a pit stop in Berkeley just for Brazil cafe!! It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? The menu is filled with delicious Dishes and pro tip: don't leave here without trying the tri tip!!! I get the regular rice bowl and my friend gets the combo plate. Both come with rice (btw what is that rice? Never tasted anything like it), tri tip (or your choice of meat), their amazingggg green sauce, a ball of ricotta cheese, and three slices of bread. The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
538,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
539,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
540,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20. After I came back, the cashier quickly recognized me and gave me my order. Definitely enjoy the transparency of the service."
541,"Wow what a great find thanks to yelp. Needed a cheap, filling, fresh meal and this hit all the spots. I loved my bowl with tri tip, sauce, veggies and pita!  It was amazingly tasty and the extra sauces on the tables were a bonus. Highly recommended."
542,I've had this cafe bookmarked forever but never make the trip out to Berkeley. I managed to go on Memorial Day. Food IMO was nothing I would drive an hour for. The service could be improved and the wait was too long. I was looking most forward to the green sauce I see from the pictures here on Yelp. I make my own version of this sauce so I was curious to try theirs. I like spicy sauces so I was unimpressed when I tried Brazil cafe's as the spice level was basically non-existent to me. Although I'm not quite sure if it's meant to be spicy at all. Did enjoy the cheese or cream in the center of the sauce. And for those who love spicy like I do they had a variety of hot sauces. We ordered #84 Pedro's favorite tri-tip sandwich and the meat combo plate. Paid around $25? The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.
543,"Small, but impressive. My cousins and I were looking for a place to eat that was 1. dog friendly and 2. something that had protein. Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe it was! A quick scan of the Yelp reviews had tri-tip highlighted everywhere and that's exactly what we ordered. As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading. I think those must be from a food truck lot. This location only has a handful of tables).MENUOur group ordered different variations of the Tri-tip (Tri-tip bowl, Tri-tip plate, Tri-tip sandwhich). The only difference between the Tri-tip bowl and plate is that the bowl does not have any side veggies, and is a little smaller than the plate. I would recommend getting the plate if you want those extra greens, since just meat + rice can feel a little heavy. The meat itself was lightly flavored, a little chewy, but still very satisfying. I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."
544,"First time trying their meal. I ordered their tri-tip salad and it was surprisingly large portion. They put a variety items into the salad and sides, and everything taste great. The staff was really nice and friendly. They also offer u a free tri-tip dipped in cilantro sauce as free sample. Have to say, their cilantro sauce is amazing. The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."
545,"Brazil Fresh Squeeze Grill's Pedro's Favorite sandwich is now also my favorite.It took several minutes to prepare and serve. The steak inside is legit pieces of good meat. The jalapeños added a kick and the bread was fresh.The Complimentary mango smoothie with your check in was not half-assed just coz it was a freebie.Brazil Fresh Squeeze is a food stand located at the corner of the parking lot of a bike shop but I'm not sure you could actually park at this lot.

I didn't finish all bread, the rice and salad was already enough for the base. The cilantro garlic sauce was amazingly flavorful, I mixed it with the hot sauce on the beef, a great combination of sauces for the beef.  Also, don't forget the free mango smoothie when you check-in on Yelp. It's a good refreshment for the big meal. SERVICEThe menu is next to the cashier, so decide on what you want and order right away. They cashier will call on your number when the food is ready for pick up, they will give you the free mango smoothie once you pick up your order.CONCLUSIONNo wonder all the locals rave about this place, it's definitely a UC Berkeley campus favorite and blew my expectations away! No complaints about Brazilian Fresh Squeeze Cafe at all, everything was good; the portions, the price, and the food! It's a must try if you find yourself in the Berkeley area."
569,"Okay, so this business listing is a bit confusing because the pictures posted by the business owner aren't of this location.  This place is a bit bigger than a kiosk and is this tiny shop right along the street.  There's some seating on the side which is great, but a lot of people also seem to take things to go.  The food here is pretty good, I really like the tri tip plate.  The green sauce is fantastic.  FYI, there's a lot of mayo in this so be prepared to feel gross afterward, but it is a tasty meal.  The workers here are friendly enough.  Also, keep in mind that the food takes quite a while to come out here.  Worth a try though if you're out here in Berkeley."
570,Come here for their trip tip sandwich or plate! You will not be disappointed. My bf and I look forward to eating here every time we're in the area. I swear something about their sauce. It's so addicting! And if you love it spicy don't forget to add the habanero hot sauce to your sandwich.
571,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce. Last year, I would come from vallejo to get my mom and plate, and I would keep bringing it to her so that she can get familiar with the sauce and try to replicate it. Although she does a very very very good job at making a mean replica, Brazil cafe still wins lol. Sorry mom. On don't forget! That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"
572,"Amazing, super juicy, tons of flavor tri-tip (I got the Pedro's sandwich, boyfriend got the plate- both amaze). Love the vibe of it being a tiny little shack on the corner with a few outdoor tables. The owner, or whom I believe to be, was super friendly, welcoming all who walked by, giving out samples of delicious meat covered in chimichurri. *Make sure to check into yelp for a free mango smoothie!*"
573,"The tri tip is bonkers, the garlic-cilantro sauce is out of this world, and that mango smoothie they've got is next-level refreshing. If I've got time to spare, I'll always stop by this little gem."
574,"If you're hangry and can't wait, don't come to this location. However, if you are hungry....their portions will satisfy you! NOTE: They have an indoor location 3 blocks away! But everyone likes to come to the ""original"", right? Place is a lot smaller than seen in photos. 5 tables, only about 15 chairs total. Definitely a grab and go place, since it's so closely located to the campus. This place is a two-man show (and 3, if you count Pedro, walking around and cleaning up the tables). Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum. DELICIOUS!!! -Chicken is too dry and skimpy slices. -Cilantro garlic sauce wasn't what I had hoped for....it was a bit too creamy and not enough cilantro taste. 1 tri-tip sandwich // YUM! I love the burst of flavors in this compact sandwich. Plentiful of meat juice, meat and sauces. I would eat two of these if I could...Definitely get this one! Pros:+Despite the long lines, the two guys in the kiosk are working their quickest!+Great menu options. I wanted to try everything!!! Cons:-Ehhh. Not exactly worth it to get their smoothies. Mango smoothie was some type of puree blended with ice...-The SO and I agree the tri-tip was really tough to chew. Not unpleasant, but not what we had entirely expected. Tips/Observations:-Water cups available! Just ask at the front.Everything I had expected and wanted to satisfy my weekly splurge. Holding off on a 5 until I can give a try at their other items..."
575,"Where has this pace been all my life... who knew that a tiny shack on the corner of a Berkeley street would house such yummy food?! Yelp was right on with this one. Don't judge a book by its cover or you'll be missing out on one of the tastiest meals you'll ever have! I recommend asking for extra green sauce (if you're a garlic lover like me). Any season, this spot is sure to satisfy!"
576,"Still the great Brazil fresh café as I remembered it. Still got it! If hungry, go for the plate, meat on rice and salad served with a slathering of the garlic green sauce!"
577,"I'll be honest. I'm not from Berkeley. I'm actually no where near Berkeley. But I make a pit stop in Berkeley just for Brazil cafe!! It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? The menu is filled with delicious Dishes and pro tip: don't leave here without trying the tri tip!!! I get the regular rice bowl and my friend gets the combo plate. Both come with rice (btw what is that rice? Never tasted anything like it), tri tip (or your choice of meat), their amazingggg green sauce, a ball of ricotta cheese, and three slices of bread. The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
578,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
579,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
580,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20. After I came back, the cashier quickly recognized me and gave me my order. Definitely enjoy the transparency of the service."
581,"Wow what a great find thanks to yelp. Needed a cheap, filling, fresh meal and this hit all the spots. I loved my bowl with tri tip, sauce, veggies and pita!  It was amazingly tasty and the extra sauces on the tables were a bonus. Highly recommended."
582,I've had this cafe bookmarked forever but never make the trip out to Berkeley. I managed to go on Memorial Day. Food IMO was nothing I would drive an hour for. The service could be improved and the wait was too long. I was looking most forward to the green sauce I see from the pictures here on Yelp. I make my own version of this sauce so I was curious to try theirs. I like spicy sauces so I was unimpressed when I tried Brazil cafe's as the spice level was basically non-existent to me. Although I'm not quite sure if it's meant to be spicy at all. Did enjoy the cheese or cream in the center of the sauce. And for those who love spicy like I do they had a variety of hot sauces. We ordered #84 Pedro's favorite tri-tip sandwich and the meat combo plate. Paid around $25? The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.
583,"Small, but impressive. My cousins and I were looking for a place to eat that was 1. dog friendly and 2. something that had protein. Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe it was! A quick scan of the Yelp reviews had tri-tip highlighted everywhere and that's exactly what we ordered. As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading. I think those must be from a food truck lot. This location only has a handful of tables).MENUOur group ordered different variations of the Tri-tip (Tri-tip bowl, Tri-tip plate, Tri-tip sandwhich). The only difference between the Tri-tip bowl and plate is that the bowl does not have any side veggies, and is a little smaller than the plate. I would recommend getting the plate if you want those extra greens, since just meat + rice can feel a little heavy. The meat itself was lightly flavored, a little chewy, but still very satisfying. I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."
584,"First time trying their meal. I ordered their tri-tip salad and it was surprisingly large portion. They put a variety items into the salad and sides, and everything taste great. The staff was really nice and friendly. They also offer u a free tri-tip dipped in cilantro sauce as free sample. Have to say, their cilantro sauce is amazing. The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."
585,"Brazil Fresh Squeeze Grill's Pedro's Favorite sandwich is now also my favorite.It took several minutes to prepare and serve. The steak inside is legit pieces of good meat. The jalapeños added a kick and the bread was fresh.The Complimentary mango smoothie with your check in was not half-assed just coz it was a freebie.Brazil Fresh Squeeze is a food stand located at the corner of the parking lot of a bike shop but I'm not sure you could actually park at this lot. No worries, there are plenty of street parking available on the streets."
586,"You know that feeling when you're out of food and you're full but you still want more? That's me at Brazil Cafe every single time.Right off the bat, be prepared to wait. The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it. As soon as the mediterranean tri-tip plate was handed to me, the first thing I noticed was how hefty it was. As soon as I opened it, it became clear what was so hefty: a generous helping of rice,  tri-tip, pita, sauce and salad along with the weight of the impending happiness that was about to enter me. The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
587,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food. The staff at the restaurant are friendly, and so are the folks that work here at this location. I discovered that you could order online through yelp24, so do that if you're in a hurry and need to grab and go! Ordering online will save you a bunch of time since they're so popular. This location is closer to campus, so much more convenient. They have a couple of tables and seats outside next to the shack, but they're usually taken. Just head over to campus and find a place to sit outside if it's a nice day and enjoy your yummy food. I got the tri-tip plate, my go to dish, which is probably a go to for many others as well.TL;DR LOVE this place, come and try the tri-tip plate!!

The owner, or whom I believe to be, was super friendly, welcoming all who walked by, giving out samples of delicious meat covered in chimichurri. *Make sure to check into yelp for a free mango smoothie!*"
613,"The tri tip is bonkers, the garlic-cilantro sauce is out of this world, and that mango smoothie they've got is next-level refreshing. If I've got time to spare, I'll always stop by this little gem."
614,"If you're hangry and can't wait, don't come to this location. However, if you are hungry....their portions will satisfy you! NOTE: They have an indoor location 3 blocks away! But everyone likes to come to the ""original"", right? Place is a lot smaller than seen in photos. 5 tables, only about 15 chairs total. Definitely a grab and go place, since it's so closely located to the campus. This place is a two-man show (and 3, if you count Pedro, walking around and cleaning up the tables). Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum. DELICIOUS!!! -Chicken is too dry and skimpy slices. -Cilantro garlic sauce wasn't what I had hoped for....it was a bit too creamy and not enough cilantro taste. 1 tri-tip sandwich // YUM! I love the burst of flavors in this compact sandwich. Plentiful of meat juice, meat and sauces. I would eat two of these if I could...Definitely get this one! Pros:+Despite the long lines, the two guys in the kiosk are working their quickest!+Great menu options. I wanted to try everything!!! Cons:-Ehhh. Not exactly worth it to get their smoothies. Mango smoothie was some type of puree blended with ice...-The SO and I agree the tri-tip was really tough to chew. Not unpleasant, but not what we had entirely expected. Tips/Observations:-Water cups available! Just ask at the front.Everything I had expected and wanted to satisfy my weekly splurge. Holding off on a 5 until I can give a try at their other items..."
615,"Where has this pace been all my life... who knew that a tiny shack on the corner of a Berkeley street would house such yummy food?! Yelp was right on with this one. Don't judge a book by its cover or you'll be missing out on one of the tastiest meals you'll ever have! I recommend asking for extra green sauce (if you're a garlic lover like me). Any season, this spot is sure to satisfy!"
616,"Still the great Brazil fresh café as I remembered it. Still got it! If hungry, go for the plate, meat on rice and salad served with a slathering of the garlic green sauce!"
617,"I'll be honest. I'm not from Berkeley. I'm actually no where near Berkeley. But I make a pit stop in Berkeley just for Brazil cafe!! It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? The menu is filled with delicious Dishes and pro tip: don't leave here without trying the tri tip!!! I get the regular rice bowl and my friend gets the combo plate. Both come with rice (btw what is that rice? Never tasted anything like it), tri tip (or your choice of meat), their amazingggg green sauce, a ball of ricotta cheese, and three slices of bread. The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
618,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
619,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
620,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20. After I came back, the cashier quickly recognized me and gave me my order. Definitely enjoy the transparency of the service."
621,"Wow what a great find thanks to yelp. Needed a cheap, filling, fresh meal and this hit all the spots. I loved my bowl with tri tip, sauce, veggies and pita!  It was amazingly tasty and the extra sauces on the tables were a bonus. Highly recommended."
622,I've had this cafe bookmarked forever but never make the trip out to Berkeley. I managed to go on Memorial Day. Food IMO was nothing I would drive an hour for. The service could be improved and the wait was too long. I was looking most forward to the green sauce I see from the pictures here on Yelp. I make my own version of this sauce so I was curious to try theirs. I like spicy sauces so I was unimpressed when I tried Brazil cafe's as the spice level was basically non-existent to me. Although I'm not quite sure if it's meant to be spicy at all. Did enjoy the cheese or cream in the center of the sauce. And for those who love spicy like I do they had a variety of hot sauces. We ordered #84 Pedro's favorite tri-tip sandwich and the meat combo plate. Paid around $25? The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.
623,"Small, but impressive. My cousins and I were looking for a place to eat that was 1. dog friendly and 2. something that had protein. Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe it was! A quick scan of the Yelp reviews had tri-tip highlighted everywhere and that's exactly what we ordered. As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading. I think those must be from a food truck lot. This location only has a handful of tables).MENUOur group ordered different variations of the Tri-tip (Tri-tip bowl, Tri-tip plate, Tri-tip sandwhich). The only difference between the Tri-tip bowl and plate is that the bowl does not have any side veggies, and is a little smaller than the plate. I would recommend getting the plate if you want those extra greens, since just meat + rice can feel a little heavy. The meat itself was lightly flavored, a little chewy, but still very satisfying. I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."
624,"First time trying their meal. I ordered their tri-tip salad and it was surprisingly large portion. They put a variety items into the salad and sides, and everything taste great. The staff was really nice and friendly. They also offer u a free tri-tip dipped in cilantro sauce as free sample. Have to say, their cilantro sauce is amazing. The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."
625,"Brazil Fresh Squeeze Grill's Pedro's Favorite sandwich is now also my favorite.It took several minutes to prepare and serve. The steak inside is legit pieces of good meat. The jalapeños added a kick and the bread was fresh.The Complimentary mango smoothie with your check in was not half-assed just coz it was a freebie.Brazil Fresh Squeeze is a food stand located at the corner of the parking lot of a bike shop but I'm not sure you could actually park at this lot. No worries, there are plenty of street parking available on the streets."
626,"You know that feeling when you're out of food and you're full but you still want more? That's me at Brazil Cafe every single time.Right off the bat, be prepared to wait. The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it. As soon as the mediterranean tri-tip plate was handed to me, the first thing I noticed was how hefty it was. As soon as I opened it, it became clear what was so hefty: a generous helping of rice,  tri-tip, pita, sauce and salad along with the weight of the impending happiness that was about to enter me. The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
627,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food. The staff at the restaurant are friendly, and so are the folks that work here at this location. I discovered that you could order online through yelp24, so do that if you're in a hurry and need to grab and go! Ordering online will save you a bunch of time since they're so popular. This location is closer to campus, so much more convenient. They have a couple of tables and seats outside next to the shack, but they're usually taken. Just head over to campus and find a place to sit outside if it's a nice day and enjoy your yummy food. I got the tri-tip plate, my go to dish, which is probably a go to for many others as well.TL;DR LOVE this place, come and try the tri-tip plate!! (Don't forget to check in on Yelp for their FREE & DELICIOUS mango smoothie!)"
628,"I was looking for a place for lunch in Berkeley when my cousin suddenly remembered this place. She vouched and insisted that the food here is amazing, so I decided that I had to find out for myself.PARKING + AMBIENCEFind street parking around the neighborhood, the cafe is super close to the UC Berkeley campus, so parking can be sparse. The place is a hut located on the side of a bike store parking lot, with parking reserved only for the store customers. Since it's a small hut, there's only a couple of tables placed on the side of the place. The food is all packed into a container, so it's perfect to take to-go.  FOODThe Tri-Tip Plate includes rice, salad, bread, and cilantro garlic sauce. The beef was so tender and juicy! The grilled onions on top of the beef complimented the overall flavor as well. The plate is a huge portion of food, so expect to potentially have leftovers. I didn't finish all bread, the rice and salad was already enough for the base. The cilantro garlic sauce was amazingly flavorful, I mixed it with the hot sauce on the beef, a great combination of sauces for the beef.  Also, don't forget the free mango smoothie when you check-in on Yelp. It's a good refreshment for the big meal. SERVICEThe menu is next to the cashier, so decide on what you want and order right away. They cashier will call on your number when the food is ready for pick up, they will give you the free mango smoothie once you pick up your order.CONCLUSIONNo wonder all the locals rave about this place, it's definitely a UC Berkeley campus favorite and blew my expectations away! No complaints about Brazilian Fresh Squeeze Cafe at all, everything was good; the portions, the price, and the food! It's a must try if you find yourself in the Berkeley area."
629,"Okay, so this business listing is a bit confusing because the pictures posted by the business owner aren't of this location.  This place is a bit bigger than a kiosk and is this tiny shop right along the street.  There's some seating on the side which is great, but a lot of people also seem to take things to go.  The food here is pretty good, I really like the tri tip plate.  The green sauce is fantastic.  FYI, there's a lot of mayo in this so be prepared to feel gross afterward, but it is a tasty meal.  The workers here are friendly enough.  Also, keep in mind that the food takes quite a while to come out here.  Worth a try though if you're out here in Berkeley."
630,Come here for their trip tip sandwich or plate! You will not be disappointed. My bf and I look forward to eating here every time we're in the area. I swear something about their sauce. It's so addicting! And if you love it spicy don't forget to add the habanero hot sauce to your sandwich.
631,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce. Last year, I would come from vallejo to get my mom and plate, and I would keep bringing it to her so that she can get familiar with the sauce and try to replicate it. Although she does a very very very good job at making a mean replica, Brazil cafe still wins lol. Sorry mom. On don't forget! That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"

656,"Still the great Brazil fresh café as I remembered it. Still got it! If hungry, go for the plate, meat on rice and salad served with a slathering of the garlic green sauce!"
657,"I'll be honest. I'm not from Berkeley. I'm actually no where near Berkeley. But I make a pit stop in Berkeley just for Brazil cafe!! It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? The menu is filled with delicious Dishes and pro tip: don't leave here without trying the tri tip!!! I get the regular rice bowl and my friend gets the combo plate. Both come with rice (btw what is that rice? Never tasted anything like it), tri tip (or your choice of meat), their amazingggg green sauce, a ball of ricotta cheese, and three slices of bread. The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
658,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
659,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
660,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20. After I came back, the cashier quickly recognized me and gave me my order. Definitely enjoy the transparency of the service."
661,"Wow what a great find thanks to yelp. Needed a cheap, filling, fresh meal and this hit all the spots. I loved my bowl with tri tip, sauce, veggies and pita!  It was amazingly tasty and the extra sauces on the tables were a bonus. Highly recommended."
662,I've had this cafe bookmarked forever but never make the trip out to Berkeley. I managed to go on Memorial Day. Food IMO was nothing I would drive an hour for. The service could be improved and the wait was too long. I was looking most forward to the green sauce I see from the pictures here on Yelp. I make my own version of this sauce so I was curious to try theirs. I like spicy sauces so I was unimpressed when I tried Brazil cafe's as the spice level was basically non-existent to me. Although I'm not quite sure if it's meant to be spicy at all. Did enjoy the cheese or cream in the center of the sauce. And for those who love spicy like I do they had a variety of hot sauces. We ordered #84 Pedro's favorite tri-tip sandwich and the meat combo plate. Paid around $25? The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.
663,"Small, but impressive. My cousins and I were looking for a place to eat that was 1. dog friendly and 2. something that had protein. Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe it was! A quick scan of the Yelp reviews had tri-tip highlighted everywhere and that's exactly what we ordered. As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading. I think those must be from a food truck lot. This location only has a handful of tables).MENUOur group ordered different variations of the Tri-tip (Tri-tip bowl, Tri-tip plate, Tri-tip sandwhich). The only difference between the Tri-tip bowl and plate is that the bowl does not have any side veggies, and is a little smaller than the plate. I would recommend getting the plate if you want those extra greens, since just meat + rice can feel a little heavy. The meat itself was lightly flavored, a little chewy, but still very satisfying. I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."
664,"First time trying their meal. I ordered their tri-tip salad and it was surprisingly large portion. They put a variety items into the salad and sides, and everything taste great. The staff was really nice and friendly. They also offer u a free tri-tip dipped in cilantro sauce as free sample. Have to say, their cilantro sauce is amazing. The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."
665,"Brazil Fresh Squeeze Grill's Pedro's Favorite sandwich is now also my favorite.It took several minutes to prepare and serve. The steak inside is legit pieces of good meat. The jalapeños added a kick and the bread was fresh.The Complimentary mango smoothie with your check in was not half-assed just coz it was a freebie.Brazil Fresh Squeeze is a food stand located at the corner of the parking lot of a bike shop but I'm not sure you could actually park at this lot. No worries, there are plenty of street parking available on the streets."
666,"You know that feeling when you're out of food and you're full but you still want more? That's me at Brazil Cafe every single time.Right off the bat, be prepared to wait. The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it. As soon as the mediterranean tri-tip plate was handed to me, the first thing I noticed was how hefty it was. As soon as I opened it, it became clear what was so hefty: a generous helping of rice,  tri-tip, pita, sauce and salad along with the weight of the impending happiness that was about to enter me. The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
667,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food. The staff at the restaurant are friendly, and so are the folks that work here at this location. I discovered that you could order online through yelp24, so do that if you're in a hurry and need to grab and go! Ordering online will save you a bunch of time since they're so popular. This location is closer to campus, so much more convenient. They have a couple of tables and seats outside next to the shack, but they're usually taken. Just head over to campus and find a place to sit outside if it's a nice day and enjoy your yummy food. I got the tri-tip plate, my go to dish, which is probably a go to for many others as well.TL;DR LOVE this place, come and try the tri-tip plate!! (Don't forget to check in on Yelp for their FREE & DELICIOUS mango smoothie!)"
668,"I was looking for a place for lunch in Berkeley when my cousin suddenly remembered this place. She vouched and insisted that the food here is amazing, so I decided that I had to find out for myself.PARKING + AMBIENCEFind street parking around the neighborhood, the cafe is super close to the UC Berkeley campus, so parking can be sparse. The place is a hut located on the side of a bike store parking lot, with parking reserved only for the store customers. Since it's a small hut, there's only a couple of tables placed on the side of the place. The food is all packed into a container, so it's perfect to take to-go.  FOODThe Tri-Tip Plate includes rice, salad, bread, and cilantro garlic sauce. The beef was so tender and juicy! The grilled onions on top of the beef complimented the overall flavor as well. The plate is a huge portion of food, so expect to potentially have leftovers. I didn't finish all bread, the rice and salad was already enough for the base. The cilantro garlic sauce was amazingly flavorful, I mixed it with the hot sauce on the beef, a great combination of sauces for the beef.  Also, don't forget the free mango smoothie when you check-in on Yelp. It's a good refreshment for the big meal. SERVICEThe menu is next to the cashier, so decide on what you want and order right away. They cashier will call on your number when the food is ready for pick up, they will give you the free mango smoothie once you pick up your order.CONCLUSIONNo wonder all the locals rave about this place, it's definitely a UC Berkeley campus favorite and blew my expectations away! No complaints about Brazilian Fresh Squeeze Cafe at all, everything was good; the portions, the price, and the food! It's a must try if you find yourself in the Berkeley area."
669,"Okay, so this business listing is a bit confusing because the pictures posted by the business owner aren't of this location.  This place is a bit bigger than a kiosk and is this tiny shop right along the street.  There's some seating on the side which is great, but a lot of people also seem to take things to go.  The food here is pretty good, I really like the tri tip plate.  The green sauce is fantastic.  FYI, there's a lot of mayo in this so be prepared to feel gross afterward, but it is a tasty meal.  The workers here are friendly enough.  Also, keep in mind that the food takes quite a while to come out here.  Worth a try though if you're out here in Berkeley."
670,Come here for their trip tip sandwich or plate! You will not be disappointed. My bf and I look forward to eating here every time we're in the area. I swear something about their sauce. It's so addicting! And if you love it spicy don't forget to add the habanero hot sauce to your sandwich.
671,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce. Last year, I would come from vallejo to get my mom and plate, and I would keep bringing it to her so that she can get familiar with the sauce and try to replicate it. Although she does a very very very good job at making a mean replica, Brazil cafe still wins lol. Sorry mom. On don't forget! That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"
672,"Amazing, super juicy, tons of flavor tri-tip (I got the Pedro's sandwich, boyfriend got the plate- both amaze). Love the vibe of it being a tiny little shack on the corner with a few outdoor tables. The owner, or whom I believe to be, was super friendly, welcoming all who walked by, giving out samples of delicious meat covered in chimichurri. *Make sure to check into yelp for a free mango smoothie!*"
673,"The tri tip is bonkers, the garlic-cilantro sauce is out of this world, and that mango smoothie they've got is next-level refreshing. If I've got time to spare, I'll always stop by this little gem."
674,"If you're hangry and can't wait, don't come to this location. However, if you are hungry....their portions will satisfy you! NOTE: They have an indoor location 3 blocks away! But everyone likes to come to the ""original"", right? Place is a lot smaller than seen in photos. 5 tables, only about 15 chairs total. Definitely a grab and go place, since it's so closely located to the campus. This place is a two-man show (and 3, if you count Pedro, walking around and cleaning up the tables). Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum. DELICIOUS!!! -Chicken is too dry and skimpy slices. -Cilantro garlic sauce wasn't what I had hoped for....it was a bit too creamy and not enough cilantro taste. 1 tri-tip sandwich // YUM! I love the burst of flavors in this compact sandwich. Plentiful of meat juice, meat and sauces. I would eat two of these if I could...Definitely get this one! Pros:+Despite the long lines, the two guys in the kiosk are working their quickest!+Great menu options. I wanted to try everything!!! Cons:-Ehhh. Not exactly worth it to get their smoothies. Mango smoothie was some type of puree blended with ice...-The SO and I agree the tri-tip was really tough to chew. Not unpleasant, but not what we had entirely expected. Tips/Observations:-Water cups available! Just ask at the front.Everything I had expected and wanted to satisfy my weekly splurge. Holding off on a 5 until I can give a try at their other items..."

Although I'm not quite sure if it's meant to be spicy at all. Did enjoy the cheese or cream in the center of the sauce. And for those who love spicy like I do they had a variety of hot sauces. We ordered #84 Pedro's favorite tri-tip sandwich and the meat combo plate. Paid around $25? The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.
703,"Small, but impressive. My cousins and I were looking for a place to eat that was 1. dog friendly and 2. something that had protein. Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe it was! A quick scan of the Yelp reviews had tri-tip highlighted everywhere and that's exactly what we ordered. As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading. I think those must be from a food truck lot. This location only has a handful of tables).MENUOur group ordered different variations of the Tri-tip (Tri-tip bowl, Tri-tip plate, Tri-tip sandwhich). The only difference between the Tri-tip bowl and plate is that the bowl does not have any side veggies, and is a little smaller than the plate. I would recommend getting the plate if you want those extra greens, since just meat + rice can feel a little heavy. The meat itself was lightly flavored, a little chewy, but still very satisfying. I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."
704,"First time trying their meal. I ordered their tri-tip salad and it was surprisingly large portion. They put a variety items into the salad and sides, and everything taste great. The staff was really nice and friendly. They also offer u a free tri-tip dipped in cilantro sauce as free sample. Have to say, their cilantro sauce is amazing. The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."
705,"Brazil Fresh Squeeze Grill's Pedro's Favorite sandwich is now also my favorite.It took several minutes to prepare and serve. The steak inside is legit pieces of good meat. The jalapeños added a kick and the bread was fresh.The Complimentary mango smoothie with your check in was not half-assed just coz it was a freebie.Brazil Fresh Squeeze is a food stand located at the corner of the parking lot of a bike shop but I'm not sure you could actually park at this lot. No worries, there are plenty of street parking available on the streets."
706,"You know that feeling when you're out of food and you're full but you still want more? That's me at Brazil Cafe every single time.Right off the bat, be prepared to wait. The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it. As soon as the mediterranean tri-tip plate was handed to me, the first thing I noticed was how hefty it was. As soon as I opened it, it became clear what was so hefty: a generous helping of rice,  tri-tip, pita, sauce and salad along with the weight of the impending happiness that was about to enter me. The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
707,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food. The staff at the restaurant are friendly, and so are the folks that work here at this location. I discovered that you could order online through yelp24, so do that if you're in a hurry and need to grab and go! Ordering online will save you a bunch of time since they're so popular. This location is closer to campus, so much more convenient. They have a couple of tables and seats outside next to the shack, but they're usually taken. Just head over to campus and find a place to sit outside if it's a nice day and enjoy your yummy food. I got the tri-tip plate, my go to dish, which is probably a go to for many others as well.TL;DR LOVE this place, come and try the tri-tip plate!! (Don't forget to check in on Yelp for their FREE & DELICIOUS mango smoothie!)"
708,"I was looking for a place for lunch in Berkeley when my cousin suddenly remembered this place. She vouched and insisted that the food here is amazing, so I decided that I had to find out for myself.PARKING + AMBIENCEFind street parking around the neighborhood, the cafe is super close to the UC Berkeley campus, so parking can be sparse. The place is a hut located on the side of a bike store parking lot, with parking reserved only for the store customers. Since it's a small hut, there's only a couple of tables placed on the side of the place. The food is all packed into a container, so it's perfect to take to-go.  FOODThe Tri-Tip Plate includes rice, salad, bread, and cilantro garlic sauce. The beef was so tender and juicy! The grilled onions on top of the beef complimented the overall flavor as well. The plate is a huge portion of food, so expect to potentially have leftovers. I didn't finish all bread, the rice and salad was already enough for the base. The cilantro garlic sauce was amazingly flavorful, I mixed it with the hot sauce on the beef, a great combination of sauces for the beef.  Also, don't forget the free mango smoothie when you check-in on Yelp. It's a good refreshment for the big meal. SERVICEThe menu is next to the cashier, so decide on what you want and order right away. They cashier will call on your number when the food is ready for pick up, they will give you the free mango smoothie once you pick up your order.CONCLUSIONNo wonder all the locals rave about this place, it's definitely a UC Berkeley campus favorite and blew my expectations away! No complaints about Brazilian Fresh Squeeze Cafe at all, everything was good; the portions, the price, and the food! It's a must try if you find yourself in the Berkeley area."
709,"Okay, so this business listing is a bit confusing because the pictures posted by the business owner aren't of this location.  This place is a bit bigger than a kiosk and is this tiny shop right along the street.  There's some seating on the side which is great, but a lot of people also seem to take things to go.  The food here is pretty good, I really like the tri tip plate.  The green sauce is fantastic.  FYI, there's a lot of mayo in this so be prepared to feel gross afterward, but it is a tasty meal.  The workers here are friendly enough.  Also, keep in mind that the food takes quite a while to come out here.  Worth a try though if you're out here in Berkeley."
710,Come here for their trip tip sandwich or plate! You will not be disappointed. My bf and I look forward to eating here every time we're in the area. I swear something about their sauce. It's so addicting! And if you love it spicy don't forget to add the habanero hot sauce to your sandwich.
711,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce. Last year, I would come from vallejo to get my mom and plate, and I would keep bringing it to her so that she can get familiar with the sauce and try to replicate it. Although she does a very very very good job at making a mean replica, Brazil cafe still wins lol. Sorry mom. On don't forget! That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"
712,"Amazing, super juicy, tons of flavor tri-tip (I got the Pedro's sandwich, boyfriend got the plate- both amaze). Love the vibe of it being a tiny little shack on the corner with a few outdoor tables. The owner, or whom I believe to be, was super friendly, welcoming all who walked by, giving out samples of delicious meat covered in chimichurri. *Make sure to check into yelp for a free mango smoothie!*"
713,"The tri tip is bonkers, the garlic-cilantro sauce is out of this world, and that mango smoothie they've got is next-level refreshing. If I've got time to spare, I'll always stop by this little gem."
714,"If you're hangry and can't wait, don't come to this location. However, if you are hungry....their portions will satisfy you! NOTE: They have an indoor location 3 blocks away! But everyone likes to come to the ""original"", right? Place is a lot smaller than seen in photos. 5 tables, only about 15 chairs total. Definitely a grab and go place, since it's so closely located to the campus. This place is a two-man show (and 3, if you count Pedro, walking around and cleaning up the tables). Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum. DELICIOUS!!! -Chicken is too dry and skimpy slices. -Cilantro garlic sauce wasn't what I had hoped for....it was a bit too creamy and not enough cilantro taste. 1 tri-tip sandwich // YUM! I love the burst of flavors in this compact sandwich. Plentiful of meat juice, meat and sauces. I would eat two of these if I could...Definitely get this one! Pros:+Despite the long lines, the two guys in the kiosk are working their quickest!+Great menu options. I wanted to try everything!!! Cons:-Ehhh. Not exactly worth it to get their smoothies. Mango smoothie was some type of puree blended with ice...-The SO and I agree the tri-tip was really tough to chew. Not unpleasant, but not what we had entirely expected. Tips/Observations:-Water cups available! Just ask at the front.Everything I had expected and wanted to satisfy my weekly splurge. Holding off on a 5 until I can give a try at their other items..."
715,"Where has this pace been all my life... who knew that a tiny shack on the corner of a Berkeley street would house such yummy food?! Yelp was right on with this one. Don't judge a book by its cover or you'll be missing out on one of the tastiest meals you'll ever have! I recommend asking for extra green sauce (if you're a garlic lover like me). Any season, this spot is sure to satisfy!"
716,"Still the great Brazil fresh café as I remembered it. Still got it! If hungry, go for the plate, meat on rice and salad served with a slathering of the garlic green sauce!"
717,"I'll be honest. I'm not from Berkeley. I'm actually no where near Berkeley. But I make a pit stop in Berkeley just for Brazil cafe!! It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? The menu is filled with delicious Dishes and pro tip: don't leave here without trying the tri tip!!! I get the regular rice bowl and my friend gets the combo plate. Both come with rice (btw what is that rice? Never tasted anything like it), tri tip (or your choice of meat), their amazingggg green sauce, a ball of ricotta cheese, and three slices of bread. The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
718,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
719,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
720,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20. After I came back, the cashier quickly recognized me and gave me my order. Definitely enjoy the transparency of the service."
721,"Wow what a great find thanks to yelp. Needed a cheap, filling, fresh meal and this hit all the spots. I loved my bowl with tri tip, sauce, veggies and pita!  It was amazingly tasty and the extra sauces on the tables were a bonus. Highly recommended."

No worries, there are plenty of street parking available on the streets."
746,"You know that feeling when you're out of food and you're full but you still want more? That's me at Brazil Cafe every single time.Right off the bat, be prepared to wait. The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it. As soon as the mediterranean tri-tip plate was handed to me, the first thing I noticed was how hefty it was. As soon as I opened it, it became clear what was so hefty: a generous helping of rice,  tri-tip, pita, sauce and salad along with the weight of the impending happiness that was about to enter me. The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
747,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food. The staff at the restaurant are friendly, and so are the folks that work here at this location. I discovered that you could order online through yelp24, so do that if you're in a hurry and need to grab and go! Ordering online will save you a bunch of time since they're so popular. This location is closer to campus, so much more convenient. They have a couple of tables and seats outside next to the shack, but they're usually taken. Just head over to campus and find a place to sit outside if it's a nice day and enjoy your yummy food. I got the tri-tip plate, my go to dish, which is probably a go to for many others as well.TL;DR LOVE this place, come and try the tri-tip plate!! (Don't forget to check in on Yelp for their FREE & DELICIOUS mango smoothie!)"
748,"I was looking for a place for lunch in Berkeley when my cousin suddenly remembered this place. She vouched and insisted that the food here is amazing, so I decided that I had to find out for myself.PARKING + AMBIENCEFind street parking around the neighborhood, the cafe is super close to the UC Berkeley campus, so parking can be sparse. The place is a hut located on the side of a bike store parking lot, with parking reserved only for the store customers. Since it's a small hut, there's only a couple of tables placed on the side of the place. The food is all packed into a container, so it's perfect to take to-go.  FOODThe Tri-Tip Plate includes rice, salad, bread, and cilantro garlic sauce. The beef was so tender and juicy! The grilled onions on top of the beef complimented the overall flavor as well. The plate is a huge portion of food, so expect to potentially have leftovers. I didn't finish all bread, the rice and salad was already enough for the base. The cilantro garlic sauce was amazingly flavorful, I mixed it with the hot sauce on the beef, a great combination of sauces for the beef.  Also, don't forget the free mango smoothie when you check-in on Yelp. It's a good refreshment for the big meal. SERVICEThe menu is next to the cashier, so decide on what you want and order right away. They cashier will call on your number when the food is ready for pick up, they will give you the free mango smoothie once you pick up your order.CONCLUSIONNo wonder all the locals rave about this place, it's definitely a UC Berkeley campus favorite and blew my expectations away! No complaints about Brazilian Fresh Squeeze Cafe at all, everything was good; the portions, the price, and the food! It's a must try if you find yourself in the Berkeley area."
749,"Okay, so this business listing is a bit confusing because the pictures posted by the business owner aren't of this location.  This place is a bit bigger than a kiosk and is this tiny shop right along the street.  There's some seating on the side which is great, but a lot of people also seem to take things to go.  The food here is pretty good, I really like the tri tip plate.  The green sauce is fantastic.  FYI, there's a lot of mayo in this so be prepared to feel gross afterward, but it is a tasty meal.  The workers here are friendly enough.  Also, keep in mind that the food takes quite a while to come out here.  Worth a try though if you're out here in Berkeley."
750,Come here for their trip tip sandwich or plate! You will not be disappointed. My bf and I look forward to eating here every time we're in the area. I swear something about their sauce. It's so addicting! And if you love it spicy don't forget to add the habanero hot sauce to your sandwich.
751,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce. Last year, I would come from vallejo to get my mom and plate, and I would keep bringing it to her so that she can get familiar with the sauce and try to replicate it. Although she does a very very very good job at making a mean replica, Brazil cafe still wins lol. Sorry mom. On don't forget! That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"
752,"Amazing, super juicy, tons of flavor tri-tip (I got the Pedro's sandwich, boyfriend got the plate- both amaze). Love the vibe of it being a tiny little shack on the corner with a few outdoor tables. The owner, or whom I believe to be, was super friendly, welcoming all who walked by, giving out samples of delicious meat covered in chimichurri. *Make sure to check into yelp for a free mango smoothie!*"
753,"The tri tip is bonkers, the garlic-cilantro sauce is out of this world, and that mango smoothie they've got is next-level refreshing. If I've got time to spare, I'll always stop by this little gem."
754,"If you're hangry and can't wait, don't come to this location. However, if you are hungry....their portions will satisfy you! NOTE: They have an indoor location 3 blocks away! But everyone likes to come to the ""original"", right? Place is a lot smaller than seen in photos. 5 tables, only about 15 chairs total. Definitely a grab and go place, since it's so closely located to the campus. This place is a two-man show (and 3, if you count Pedro, walking around and cleaning up the tables). Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum. DELICIOUS!!! -Chicken is too dry and skimpy slices. -Cilantro garlic sauce wasn't what I had hoped for....it was a bit too creamy and not enough cilantro taste. 1 tri-tip sandwich // YUM! I love the burst of flavors in this compact sandwich. Plentiful of meat juice, meat and sauces. I would eat two of these if I could...Definitely get this one! Pros:+Despite the long lines, the two guys in the kiosk are working their quickest!+Great menu options. I wanted to try everything!!! Cons:-Ehhh. Not exactly worth it to get their smoothies. Mango smoothie was some type of puree blended with ice...-The SO and I agree the tri-tip was really tough to chew. Not unpleasant, but not what we had entirely expected. Tips/Observations:-Water cups available! Just ask at the front.Everything I had expected and wanted to satisfy my weekly splurge. Holding off on a 5 until I can give a try at their other items..."
755,"Where has this pace been all my life... who knew that a tiny shack on the corner of a Berkeley street would house such yummy food?! Yelp was right on with this one. Don't judge a book by its cover or you'll be missing out on one of the tastiest meals you'll ever have! I recommend asking for extra green sauce (if you're a garlic lover like me). Any season, this spot is sure to satisfy!"
756,"Still the great Brazil fresh café as I remembered it. Still got it! If hungry, go for the plate, meat on rice and salad served with a slathering of the garlic green sauce!"
757,"I'll be honest. I'm not from Berkeley. I'm actually no where near Berkeley. But I make a pit stop in Berkeley just for Brazil cafe!! It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? The menu is filled with delicious Dishes and pro tip: don't leave here without trying the tri tip!!! I get the regular rice bowl and my friend gets the combo plate. Both come with rice (btw what is that rice? Never tasted anything like it), tri tip (or your choice of meat), their amazingggg green sauce, a ball of ricotta cheese, and three slices of bread. The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
758,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
759,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
760,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20. After I came back, the cashier quickly recognized me and gave me my order. Definitely enjoy the transparency of the service."
761,"Wow what a great find thanks to yelp. Needed a cheap, filling, fresh meal and this hit all the spots. I loved my bowl with tri tip, sauce, veggies and pita!  It was amazingly tasty and the extra sauces on the tables were a bonus. Highly recommended."
762,I've had this cafe bookmarked forever but never make the trip out to Berkeley. I managed to go on Memorial Day. Food IMO was nothing I would drive an hour for. The service could be improved and the wait was too long. I was looking most forward to the green sauce I see from the pictures here on Yelp. I make my own version of this sauce so I was curious to try theirs. I like spicy sauces so I was unimpressed when I tried Brazil cafe's as the spice level was basically non-existent to me. Although I'm not quite sure if it's meant to be spicy at all. Did enjoy the cheese or cream in the center of the sauce. And for those who love spicy like I do they had a variety of hot sauces. We ordered #84 Pedro's favorite tri-tip sandwich and the meat combo plate. Paid around $25? The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.
763,"Small, but impressive. My cousins and I were looking for a place to eat that was 1. dog friendly and 2. something that had protein. Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe it was! A quick scan of the Yelp reviews had tri-tip highlighted everywhere and that's exactly what we ordered. As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading. I think those must be from a food truck lot. This location only has a handful of tables).MENUOur group ordered different variations of the Tri-tip (Tri-tip bowl, Tri-tip plate, Tri-tip sandwhich). The only difference between the Tri-tip bowl and plate is that the bowl does not have any side veggies, and is a little smaller than the plate. I would recommend getting the plate if you want those extra greens, since just meat + rice can feel a little heavy. The meat itself was lightly flavored, a little chewy, but still very satisfying. I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."
764,"First time trying their meal. I ordered their tri-tip salad and it was surprisingly large portion. They put a variety items into the salad and sides, and everything taste great. The staff was really nice and friendly. They also offer u a free tri-tip dipped in cilantro sauce as free sample. Have to say, their cilantro sauce is amazing. The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."

Since it's a small hut, there's only a couple of tables placed on the side of the place. The food is all packed into a container, so it's perfect to take to-go.  FOODThe Tri-Tip Plate includes rice, salad, bread, and cilantro garlic sauce. The beef was so tender and juicy! The grilled onions on top of the beef complimented the overall flavor as well. The plate is a huge portion of food, so expect to potentially have leftovers. I didn't finish all bread, the rice and salad was already enough for the base. The cilantro garlic sauce was amazingly flavorful, I mixed it with the hot sauce on the beef, a great combination of sauces for the beef.  Also, don't forget the free mango smoothie when you check-in on Yelp. It's a good refreshment for the big meal. SERVICEThe menu is next to the cashier, so decide on what you want and order right away. They cashier will call on your number when the food is ready for pick up, they will give you the free mango smoothie once you pick up your order.CONCLUSIONNo wonder all the locals rave about this place, it's definitely a UC Berkeley campus favorite and blew my expectations away! No complaints about Brazilian Fresh Squeeze Cafe at all, everything was good; the portions, the price, and the food! It's a must try if you find yourself in the Berkeley area."
789,"Okay, so this business listing is a bit confusing because the pictures posted by the business owner aren't of this location.  This place is a bit bigger than a kiosk and is this tiny shop right along the street.  There's some seating on the side which is great, but a lot of people also seem to take things to go.  The food here is pretty good, I really like the tri tip plate.  The green sauce is fantastic.  FYI, there's a lot of mayo in this so be prepared to feel gross afterward, but it is a tasty meal.  The workers here are friendly enough.  Also, keep in mind that the food takes quite a while to come out here.  Worth a try though if you're out here in Berkeley."
790,Come here for their trip tip sandwich or plate! You will not be disappointed. My bf and I look forward to eating here every time we're in the area. I swear something about their sauce. It's so addicting! And if you love it spicy don't forget to add the habanero hot sauce to your sandwich.
791,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce. Last year, I would come from vallejo to get my mom and plate, and I would keep bringing it to her so that she can get familiar with the sauce and try to replicate it. Although she does a very very very good job at making a mean replica, Brazil cafe still wins lol. Sorry mom. On don't forget! That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"
792,"Amazing, super juicy, tons of flavor tri-tip (I got the Pedro's sandwich, boyfriend got the plate- both amaze). Love the vibe of it being a tiny little shack on the corner with a few outdoor tables. The owner, or whom I believe to be, was super friendly, welcoming all who walked by, giving out samples of delicious meat covered in chimichurri. *Make sure to check into yelp for a free mango smoothie!*"
793,"The tri tip is bonkers, the garlic-cilantro sauce is out of this world, and that mango smoothie they've got is next-level refreshing. If I've got time to spare, I'll always stop by this little gem."
794,"If you're hangry and can't wait, don't come to this location. However, if you are hungry....their portions will satisfy you! NOTE: They have an indoor location 3 blocks away! But everyone likes to come to the ""original"", right? Place is a lot smaller than seen in photos. 5 tables, only about 15 chairs total. Definitely a grab and go place, since it's so closely located to the campus. This place is a two-man show (and 3, if you count Pedro, walking around and cleaning up the tables). Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum. DELICIOUS!!! -Chicken is too dry and skimpy slices. -Cilantro garlic sauce wasn't what I had hoped for....it was a bit too creamy and not enough cilantro taste. 1 tri-tip sandwich // YUM! I love the burst of flavors in this compact sandwich. Plentiful of meat juice, meat and sauces. I would eat two of these if I could...Definitely get this one! Pros:+Despite the long lines, the two guys in the kiosk are working their quickest!+Great menu options. I wanted to try everything!!! Cons:-Ehhh. Not exactly worth it to get their smoothies. Mango smoothie was some type of puree blended with ice...-The SO and I agree the tri-tip was really tough to chew. Not unpleasant, but not what we had entirely expected. Tips/Observations:-Water cups available! Just ask at the front.Everything I had expected and wanted to satisfy my weekly splurge. Holding off on a 5 until I can give a try at their other items..."
795,"Where has this pace been all my life... who knew that a tiny shack on the corner of a Berkeley street would house such yummy food?! Yelp was right on with this one. Don't judge a book by its cover or you'll be missing out on one of the tastiest meals you'll ever have! I recommend asking for extra green sauce (if you're a garlic lover like me). Any season, this spot is sure to satisfy!"
796,"Still the great Brazil fresh café as I remembered it. Still got it! If hungry, go for the plate, meat on rice and salad served with a slathering of the garlic green sauce!"
797,"I'll be honest. I'm not from Berkeley. I'm actually no where near Berkeley. But I make a pit stop in Berkeley just for Brazil cafe!! It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? The menu is filled with delicious Dishes and pro tip: don't leave here without trying the tri tip!!! I get the regular rice bowl and my friend gets the combo plate. Both come with rice (btw what is that rice? Never tasted anything like it), tri tip (or your choice of meat), their amazingggg green sauce, a ball of ricotta cheese, and three slices of bread. The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
798,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
799,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
800,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20. After I came back, the cashier quickly recognized me and gave me my order. Definitely enjoy the transparency of the service."
801,"Wow what a great find thanks to yelp. Needed a cheap, filling, fresh meal and this hit all the spots. I loved my bowl with tri tip, sauce, veggies and pita!  It was amazingly tasty and the extra sauces on the tables were a bonus. Highly recommended."
802,I've had this cafe bookmarked forever but never make the trip out to Berkeley. I managed to go on Memorial Day. Food IMO was nothing I would drive an hour for. The service could be improved and the wait was too long. I was looking most forward to the green sauce I see from the pictures here on Yelp. I make my own version of this sauce so I was curious to try theirs. I like spicy sauces so I was unimpressed when I tried Brazil cafe's as the spice level was basically non-existent to me. Although I'm not quite sure if it's meant to be spicy at all. Did enjoy the cheese or cream in the center of the sauce. And for those who love spicy like I do they had a variety of hot sauces. We ordered #84 Pedro's favorite tri-tip sandwich and the meat combo plate. Paid around $25? The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.
803,"Small, but impressive. My cousins and I were looking for a place to eat that was 1. dog friendly and 2. something that had protein. Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe it was! A quick scan of the Yelp reviews had tri-tip highlighted everywhere and that's exactly what we ordered. As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading. I think those must be from a food truck lot. This location only has a handful of tables).MENUOur group ordered different variations of the Tri-tip (Tri-tip bowl, Tri-tip plate, Tri-tip sandwhich). The only difference between the Tri-tip bowl and plate is that the bowl does not have any side veggies, and is a little smaller than the plate. I would recommend getting the plate if you want those extra greens, since just meat + rice can feel a little heavy. The meat itself was lightly flavored, a little chewy, but still very satisfying. I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."
804,"First time trying their meal. I ordered their tri-tip salad and it was surprisingly large portion. They put a variety items into the salad and sides, and everything taste great. The staff was really nice and friendly. They also offer u a free tri-tip dipped in cilantro sauce as free sample. Have to say, their cilantro sauce is amazing. The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."
805,"Brazil Fresh Squeeze Grill's Pedro's Favorite sandwich is now also my favorite.It took several minutes to prepare and serve. The steak inside is legit pieces of good meat. The jalapeños added a kick and the bread was fresh.The Complimentary mango smoothie with your check in was not half-assed just coz it was a freebie.Brazil Fresh Squeeze is a food stand located at the corner of the parking lot of a bike shop but I'm not sure you could actually park at this lot. No worries, there are plenty of street parking available on the streets."
806,"You know that feeling when you're out of food and you're full but you still want more? That's me at Brazil Cafe every single time.Right off the bat, be prepared to wait. The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it. As soon as the mediterranean tri-tip plate was handed to me, the first thing I noticed was how hefty it was. As soon as I opened it, it became clear what was so hefty: a generous helping of rice,  tri-tip, pita, sauce and salad along with the weight of the impending happiness that was about to enter me. The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
807,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food. The staff at the restaurant are friendly, and so are the folks that work here at this location. I discovered that you could order online through yelp24, so do that if you're in a hurry and need to grab and go! Ordering online will save you a bunch of time since they're so popular. This location is closer to campus, so much more convenient. They have a couple of tables and seats outside next to the shack, but they're usually taken. Just head over to campus and find a place to sit outside if it's a nice day and enjoy your yummy food. I got the tri-tip plate, my go to dish, which is probably a go to for many others as well.TL;DR LOVE this place, come and try the tri-tip plate!!

That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"
832,"Amazing, super juicy, tons of flavor tri-tip (I got the Pedro's sandwich, boyfriend got the plate- both amaze). Love the vibe of it being a tiny little shack on the corner with a few outdoor tables. The owner, or whom I believe to be, was super friendly, welcoming all who walked by, giving out samples of delicious meat covered in chimichurri. *Make sure to check into yelp for a free mango smoothie!*"
833,"The tri tip is bonkers, the garlic-cilantro sauce is out of this world, and that mango smoothie they've got is next-level refreshing. If I've got time to spare, I'll always stop by this little gem."
834,"If you're hangry and can't wait, don't come to this location. However, if you are hungry....their portions will satisfy you! NOTE: They have an indoor location 3 blocks away! But everyone likes to come to the ""original"", right? Place is a lot smaller than seen in photos. 5 tables, only about 15 chairs total. Definitely a grab and go place, since it's so closely located to the campus. This place is a two-man show (and 3, if you count Pedro, walking around and cleaning up the tables). Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum. DELICIOUS!!! -Chicken is too dry and skimpy slices. -Cilantro garlic sauce wasn't what I had hoped for....it was a bit too creamy and not enough cilantro taste. 1 tri-tip sandwich // YUM! I love the burst of flavors in this compact sandwich. Plentiful of meat juice, meat and sauces. I would eat two of these if I could...Definitely get this one! Pros:+Despite the long lines, the two guys in the kiosk are working their quickest!+Great menu options. I wanted to try everything!!! Cons:-Ehhh. Not exactly worth it to get their smoothies. Mango smoothie was some type of puree blended with ice...-The SO and I agree the tri-tip was really tough to chew. Not unpleasant, but not what we had entirely expected. Tips/Observations:-Water cups available! Just ask at the front.Everything I had expected and wanted to satisfy my weekly splurge. Holding off on a 5 until I can give a try at their other items..."
835,"Where has this pace been all my life... who knew that a tiny shack on the corner of a Berkeley street would house such yummy food?! Yelp was right on with this one. Don't judge a book by its cover or you'll be missing out on one of the tastiest meals you'll ever have! I recommend asking for extra green sauce (if you're a garlic lover like me). Any season, this spot is sure to satisfy!"
836,"Still the great Brazil fresh café as I remembered it. Still got it! If hungry, go for the plate, meat on rice and salad served with a slathering of the garlic green sauce!"
837,"I'll be honest. I'm not from Berkeley. I'm actually no where near Berkeley. But I make a pit stop in Berkeley just for Brazil cafe!! It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? The menu is filled with delicious Dishes and pro tip: don't leave here without trying the tri tip!!! I get the regular rice bowl and my friend gets the combo plate. Both come with rice (btw what is that rice? Never tasted anything like it), tri tip (or your choice of meat), their amazingggg green sauce, a ball of ricotta cheese, and three slices of bread. The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
838,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
839,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
840,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20. After I came back, the cashier quickly recognized me and gave me my order. Definitely enjoy the transparency of the service."
841,"Wow what a great find thanks to yelp. Needed a cheap, filling, fresh meal and this hit all the spots. I loved my bowl with tri tip, sauce, veggies and pita!  It was amazingly tasty and the extra sauces on the tables were a bonus. Highly recommended."
842,I've had this cafe bookmarked forever but never make the trip out to Berkeley. I managed to go on Memorial Day. Food IMO was nothing I would drive an hour for. The service could be improved and the wait was too long. I was looking most forward to the green sauce I see from the pictures here on Yelp. I make my own version of this sauce so I was curious to try theirs. I like spicy sauces so I was unimpressed when I tried Brazil cafe's as the spice level was basically non-existent to me. Although I'm not quite sure if it's meant to be spicy at all. Did enjoy the cheese or cream in the center of the sauce. And for those who love spicy like I do they had a variety of hot sauces. We ordered #84 Pedro's favorite tri-tip sandwich and the meat combo plate. Paid around $25? The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.
843,"Small, but impressive. My cousins and I were looking for a place to eat that was 1. dog friendly and 2. something that had protein. Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe it was! A quick scan of the Yelp reviews had tri-tip highlighted everywhere and that's exactly what we ordered. As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading. I think those must be from a food truck lot. This location only has a handful of tables).MENUOur group ordered different variations of the Tri-tip (Tri-tip bowl, Tri-tip plate, Tri-tip sandwhich). The only difference between the Tri-tip bowl and plate is that the bowl does not have any side veggies, and is a little smaller than the plate. I would recommend getting the plate if you want those extra greens, since just meat + rice can feel a little heavy. The meat itself was lightly flavored, a little chewy, but still very satisfying. I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."
844,"First time trying their meal. I ordered their tri-tip salad and it was surprisingly large portion. They put a variety items into the salad and sides, and everything taste great. The staff was really nice and friendly. They also offer u a free tri-tip dipped in cilantro sauce as free sample. Have to say, their cilantro sauce is amazing. The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."
845,"Brazil Fresh Squeeze Grill's Pedro's Favorite sandwich is now also my favorite.It took several minutes to prepare and serve. The steak inside is legit pieces of good meat. The jalapeños added a kick and the bread was fresh.The Complimentary mango smoothie with your check in was not half-assed just coz it was a freebie.Brazil Fresh Squeeze is a food stand located at the corner of the parking lot of a bike shop but I'm not sure you could actually park at this lot. No worries, there are plenty of street parking available on the streets."
846,"You know that feeling when you're out of food and you're full but you still want more? That's me at Brazil Cafe every single time.Right off the bat, be prepared to wait. The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it. As soon as the mediterranean tri-tip plate was handed to me, the first thing I noticed was how hefty it was. As soon as I opened it, it became clear what was so hefty: a generous helping of rice,  tri-tip, pita, sauce and salad along with the weight of the impending happiness that was about to enter me. The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
847,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food. The staff at the restaurant are friendly, and so are the folks that work here at this location. I discovered that you could order online through yelp24, so do that if you're in a hurry and need to grab and go! Ordering online will save you a bunch of time since they're so popular. This location is closer to campus, so much more convenient. They have a couple of tables and seats outside next to the shack, but they're usually taken. Just head over to campus and find a place to sit outside if it's a nice day and enjoy your yummy food. I got the tri-tip plate, my go to dish, which is probably a go to for many others as well.TL;DR LOVE this place, come and try the tri-tip plate!! (Don't forget to check in on Yelp for their FREE & DELICIOUS mango smoothie!)"
848,"I was looking for a place for lunch in Berkeley when my cousin suddenly remembered this place. She vouched and insisted that the food here is amazing, so I decided that I had to find out for myself.PARKING + AMBIENCEFind street parking around the neighborhood, the cafe is super close to the UC Berkeley campus, so parking can be sparse. The place is a hut located on the side of a bike store parking lot, with parking reserved only for the store customers. Since it's a small hut, there's only a couple of tables placed on the side of the place. The food is all packed into a container, so it's perfect to take to-go.  FOODThe Tri-Tip Plate includes rice, salad, bread, and cilantro garlic sauce. The beef was so tender and juicy! The grilled onions on top of the beef complimented the overall flavor as well. The plate is a huge portion of food, so expect to potentially have leftovers. I didn't finish all bread, the rice and salad was already enough for the base. The cilantro garlic sauce was amazingly flavorful, I mixed it with the hot sauce on the beef, a great combination of sauces for the beef.  Also, don't forget the free mango smoothie when you check-in on Yelp. It's a good refreshment for the big meal. SERVICEThe menu is next to the cashier, so decide on what you want and order right away. They cashier will call on your number when the food is ready for pick up, they will give you the free mango smoothie once you pick up your order.CONCLUSIONNo wonder all the locals rave about this place, it's definitely a UC Berkeley campus favorite and blew my expectations away! No complaints about Brazilian Fresh Squeeze Cafe at all, everything was good; the portions, the price, and the food! It's a must try if you find yourself in the Berkeley area."
849,"Okay, so this business listing is a bit confusing because the pictures posted by the business owner aren't of this location.  This place is a bit bigger than a kiosk and is this tiny shop right along the street.  There's some seating on the side which is great, but a lot of people also seem to take things to go.  The food here is pretty good, I really like the tri tip plate.  The green sauce is fantastic.  FYI, there's a lot of mayo in this so be prepared to feel gross afterward, but it is a tasty meal.  The workers here are friendly enough.  Also, keep in mind that the food takes quite a while to come out here.  Worth a try though if you're out here in Berkeley."
850,Come here for their trip tip sandwich or plate! You will not be disappointed. My bf and I look forward to eating here every time we're in the area. I swear something about their sauce. It's so addicting! And if you love it spicy don't forget to add the habanero hot sauce to your sandwich.
851,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce.

875,"Where has this pace been all my life... who knew that a tiny shack on the corner of a Berkeley street would house such yummy food?! Yelp was right on with this one. Don't judge a book by its cover or you'll be missing out on one of the tastiest meals you'll ever have! I recommend asking for extra green sauce (if you're a garlic lover like me). Any season, this spot is sure to satisfy!"
876,"Still the great Brazil fresh café as I remembered it. Still got it! If hungry, go for the plate, meat on rice and salad served with a slathering of the garlic green sauce!"
877,"I'll be honest. I'm not from Berkeley. I'm actually no where near Berkeley. But I make a pit stop in Berkeley just for Brazil cafe!! It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? The menu is filled with delicious Dishes and pro tip: don't leave here without trying the tri tip!!! I get the regular rice bowl and my friend gets the combo plate. Both come with rice (btw what is that rice? Never tasted anything like it), tri tip (or your choice of meat), their amazingggg green sauce, a ball of ricotta cheese, and three slices of bread. The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
878,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
879,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
880,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20. After I came back, the cashier quickly recognized me and gave me my order. Definitely enjoy the transparency of the service."
881,"Wow what a great find thanks to yelp. Needed a cheap, filling, fresh meal and this hit all the spots. I loved my bowl with tri tip, sauce, veggies and pita!  It was amazingly tasty and the extra sauces on the tables were a bonus. Highly recommended."
882,I've had this cafe bookmarked forever but never make the trip out to Berkeley. I managed to go on Memorial Day. Food IMO was nothing I would drive an hour for. The service could be improved and the wait was too long. I was looking most forward to the green sauce I see from the pictures here on Yelp. I make my own version of this sauce so I was curious to try theirs. I like spicy sauces so I was unimpressed when I tried Brazil cafe's as the spice level was basically non-existent to me. Although I'm not quite sure if it's meant to be spicy at all. Did enjoy the cheese or cream in the center of the sauce. And for those who love spicy like I do they had a variety of hot sauces. We ordered #84 Pedro's favorite tri-tip sandwich and the meat combo plate. Paid around $25? The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.
883,"Small, but impressive. My cousins and I were looking for a place to eat that was 1. dog friendly and 2. something that had protein. Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe it was! A quick scan of the Yelp reviews had tri-tip highlighted everywhere and that's exactly what we ordered. As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading. I think those must be from a food truck lot. This location only has a handful of tables).MENUOur group ordered different variations of the Tri-tip (Tri-tip bowl, Tri-tip plate, Tri-tip sandwhich). The only difference between the Tri-tip bowl and plate is that the bowl does not have any side veggies, and is a little smaller than the plate. I would recommend getting the plate if you want those extra greens, since just meat + rice can feel a little heavy. The meat itself was lightly flavored, a little chewy, but still very satisfying. I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."
884,"First time trying their meal. I ordered their tri-tip salad and it was surprisingly large portion. They put a variety items into the salad and sides, and everything taste great. The staff was really nice and friendly. They also offer u a free tri-tip dipped in cilantro sauce as free sample. Have to say, their cilantro sauce is amazing. The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."
885,"Brazil Fresh Squeeze Grill's Pedro's Favorite sandwich is now also my favorite.It took several minutes to prepare and serve. The steak inside is legit pieces of good meat. The jalapeños added a kick and the bread was fresh.The Complimentary mango smoothie with your check in was not half-assed just coz it was a freebie.Brazil Fresh Squeeze is a food stand located at the corner of the parking lot of a bike shop but I'm not sure you could actually park at this lot. No worries, there are plenty of street parking available on the streets."
886,"You know that feeling when you're out of food and you're full but you still want more? That's me at Brazil Cafe every single time.Right off the bat, be prepared to wait. The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it. As soon as the mediterranean tri-tip plate was handed to me, the first thing I noticed was how hefty it was. As soon as I opened it, it became clear what was so hefty: a generous helping of rice,  tri-tip, pita, sauce and salad along with the weight of the impending happiness that was about to enter me. The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
887,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food. The staff at the restaurant are friendly, and so are the folks that work here at this location. I discovered that you could order online through yelp24, so do that if you're in a hurry and need to grab and go! Ordering online will save you a bunch of time since they're so popular. This location is closer to campus, so much more convenient. They have a couple of tables and seats outside next to the shack, but they're usually taken. Just head over to campus and find a place to sit outside if it's a nice day and enjoy your yummy food. I got the tri-tip plate, my go to dish, which is probably a go to for many others as well.TL;DR LOVE this place, come and try the tri-tip plate!! (Don't forget to check in on Yelp for their FREE & DELICIOUS mango smoothie!)"
888,"I was looking for a place for lunch in Berkeley when my cousin suddenly remembered this place. She vouched and insisted that the food here is amazing, so I decided that I had to find out for myself.PARKING + AMBIENCEFind street parking around the neighborhood, the cafe is super close to the UC Berkeley campus, so parking can be sparse. The place is a hut located on the side of a bike store parking lot, with parking reserved only for the store customers. Since it's a small hut, there's only a couple of tables placed on the side of the place. The food is all packed into a container, so it's perfect to take to-go.  FOODThe Tri-Tip Plate includes rice, salad, bread, and cilantro garlic sauce. The beef was so tender and juicy! The grilled onions on top of the beef complimented the overall flavor as well. The plate is a huge portion of food, so expect to potentially have leftovers. I didn't finish all bread, the rice and salad was already enough for the base. The cilantro garlic sauce was amazingly flavorful, I mixed it with the hot sauce on the beef, a great combination of sauces for the beef.  Also, don't forget the free mango smoothie when you check-in on Yelp. It's a good refreshment for the big meal. SERVICEThe menu is next to the cashier, so decide on what you want and order right away. They cashier will call on your number when the food is ready for pick up, they will give you the free mango smoothie once you pick up your order.CONCLUSIONNo wonder all the locals rave about this place, it's definitely a UC Berkeley campus favorite and blew my expectations away! No complaints about Brazilian Fresh Squeeze Cafe at all, everything was good; the portions, the price, and the food! It's a must try if you find yourself in the Berkeley area."
889,"Okay, so this business listing is a bit confusing because the pictures posted by the business owner aren't of this location.  This place is a bit bigger than a kiosk and is this tiny shop right along the street.  There's some seating on the side which is great, but a lot of people also seem to take things to go.  The food here is pretty good, I really like the tri tip plate.  The green sauce is fantastic.  FYI, there's a lot of mayo in this so be prepared to feel gross afterward, but it is a tasty meal.  The workers here are friendly enough.  Also, keep in mind that the food takes quite a while to come out here.  Worth a try though if you're out here in Berkeley."
890,Come here for their trip tip sandwich or plate! You will not be disappointed. My bf and I look forward to eating here every time we're in the area. I swear something about their sauce. It's so addicting! And if you love it spicy don't forget to add the habanero hot sauce to your sandwich.
891,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce. Last year, I would come from vallejo to get my mom and plate, and I would keep bringing it to her so that she can get familiar with the sauce and try to replicate it. Although she does a very very very good job at making a mean replica, Brazil cafe still wins lol. Sorry mom. On don't forget! That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"
892,"Amazing, super juicy, tons of flavor tri-tip (I got the Pedro's sandwich, boyfriend got the plate- both amaze). Love the vibe of it being a tiny little shack on the corner with a few outdoor tables. The owner, or whom I believe to be, was super friendly, welcoming all who walked by, giving out samples of delicious meat covered in chimichurri. *Make sure to check into yelp for a free mango smoothie!*"
893,"The tri tip is bonkers, the garlic-cilantro sauce is out of this world, and that mango smoothie they've got is next-level refreshing. If I've got time to spare, I'll always stop by this little gem."
894,"If you're hangry and can't wait, don't come to this location. However, if you are hungry....their portions will satisfy you! NOTE: They have an indoor location 3 blocks away! But everyone likes to come to the ""original"", right? Place is a lot smaller than seen in photos. 5 tables, only about 15 chairs total. Definitely a grab and go place, since it's so closely located to the campus. This place is a two-man show (and 3, if you count Pedro, walking around and cleaning up the tables). Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum.

922,I've had this cafe bookmarked forever but never make the trip out to Berkeley. I managed to go on Memorial Day. Food IMO was nothing I would drive an hour for. The service could be improved and the wait was too long. I was looking most forward to the green sauce I see from the pictures here on Yelp. I make my own version of this sauce so I was curious to try theirs. I like spicy sauces so I was unimpressed when I tried Brazil cafe's as the spice level was basically non-existent to me. Although I'm not quite sure if it's meant to be spicy at all. Did enjoy the cheese or cream in the center of the sauce. And for those who love spicy like I do they had a variety of hot sauces. We ordered #84 Pedro's favorite tri-tip sandwich and the meat combo plate. Paid around $25? The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.
923,"Small, but impressive. My cousins and I were looking for a place to eat that was 1. dog friendly and 2. something that had protein. Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe it was! A quick scan of the Yelp reviews had tri-tip highlighted everywhere and that's exactly what we ordered. As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading. I think those must be from a food truck lot. This location only has a handful of tables).MENUOur group ordered different variations of the Tri-tip (Tri-tip bowl, Tri-tip plate, Tri-tip sandwhich). The only difference between the Tri-tip bowl and plate is that the bowl does not have any side veggies, and is a little smaller than the plate. I would recommend getting the plate if you want those extra greens, since just meat + rice can feel a little heavy. The meat itself was lightly flavored, a little chewy, but still very satisfying. I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."
924,"First time trying their meal. I ordered their tri-tip salad and it was surprisingly large portion. They put a variety items into the salad and sides, and everything taste great. The staff was really nice and friendly. They also offer u a free tri-tip dipped in cilantro sauce as free sample. Have to say, their cilantro sauce is amazing. The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."
925,"Brazil Fresh Squeeze Grill's Pedro's Favorite sandwich is now also my favorite.It took several minutes to prepare and serve. The steak inside is legit pieces of good meat. The jalapeños added a kick and the bread was fresh.The Complimentary mango smoothie with your check in was not half-assed just coz it was a freebie.Brazil Fresh Squeeze is a food stand located at the corner of the parking lot of a bike shop but I'm not sure you could actually park at this lot. No worries, there are plenty of street parking available on the streets."
926,"You know that feeling when you're out of food and you're full but you still want more? That's me at Brazil Cafe every single time.Right off the bat, be prepared to wait. The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it. As soon as the mediterranean tri-tip plate was handed to me, the first thing I noticed was how hefty it was. As soon as I opened it, it became clear what was so hefty: a generous helping of rice,  tri-tip, pita, sauce and salad along with the weight of the impending happiness that was about to enter me. The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
927,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food. The staff at the restaurant are friendly, and so are the folks that work here at this location. I discovered that you could order online through yelp24, so do that if you're in a hurry and need to grab and go! Ordering online will save you a bunch of time since they're so popular. This location is closer to campus, so much more convenient. They have a couple of tables and seats outside next to the shack, but they're usually taken. Just head over to campus and find a place to sit outside if it's a nice day and enjoy your yummy food. I got the tri-tip plate, my go to dish, which is probably a go to for many others as well.TL;DR LOVE this place, come and try the tri-tip plate!! (Don't forget to check in on Yelp for their FREE & DELICIOUS mango smoothie!)"
928,"I was looking for a place for lunch in Berkeley when my cousin suddenly remembered this place. She vouched and insisted that the food here is amazing, so I decided that I had to find out for myself.PARKING + AMBIENCEFind street parking around the neighborhood, the cafe is super close to the UC Berkeley campus, so parking can be sparse. The place is a hut located on the side of a bike store parking lot, with parking reserved only for the store customers. Since it's a small hut, there's only a couple of tables placed on the side of the place. The food is all packed into a container, so it's perfect to take to-go.  FOODThe Tri-Tip Plate includes rice, salad, bread, and cilantro garlic sauce. The beef was so tender and juicy! The grilled onions on top of the beef complimented the overall flavor as well. The plate is a huge portion of food, so expect to potentially have leftovers. I didn't finish all bread, the rice and salad was already enough for the base. The cilantro garlic sauce was amazingly flavorful, I mixed it with the hot sauce on the beef, a great combination of sauces for the beef.  Also, don't forget the free mango smoothie when you check-in on Yelp. It's a good refreshment for the big meal. SERVICEThe menu is next to the cashier, so decide on what you want and order right away. They cashier will call on your number when the food is ready for pick up, they will give you the free mango smoothie once you pick up your order.CONCLUSIONNo wonder all the locals rave about this place, it's definitely a UC Berkeley campus favorite and blew my expectations away! No complaints about Brazilian Fresh Squeeze Cafe at all, everything was good; the portions, the price, and the food! It's a must try if you find yourself in the Berkeley area."
929,"Okay, so this business listing is a bit confusing because the pictures posted by the business owner aren't of this location.  This place is a bit bigger than a kiosk and is this tiny shop right along the street.  There's some seating on the side which is great, but a lot of people also seem to take things to go.  The food here is pretty good, I really like the tri tip plate.  The green sauce is fantastic.  FYI, there's a lot of mayo in this so be prepared to feel gross afterward, but it is a tasty meal.  The workers here are friendly enough.  Also, keep in mind that the food takes quite a while to come out here.  Worth a try though if you're out here in Berkeley."
930,Come here for their trip tip sandwich or plate! You will not be disappointed. My bf and I look forward to eating here every time we're in the area. I swear something about their sauce. It's so addicting! And if you love it spicy don't forget to add the habanero hot sauce to your sandwich.
931,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce. Last year, I would come from vallejo to get my mom and plate, and I would keep bringing it to her so that she can get familiar with the sauce and try to replicate it. Although she does a very very very good job at making a mean replica, Brazil cafe still wins lol. Sorry mom. On don't forget! That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"
932,"Amazing, super juicy, tons of flavor tri-tip (I got the Pedro's sandwich, boyfriend got the plate- both amaze). Love the vibe of it being a tiny little shack on the corner with a few outdoor tables. The owner, or whom I believe to be, was super friendly, welcoming all who walked by, giving out samples of delicious meat covered in chimichurri. *Make sure to check into yelp for a free mango smoothie!*"
933,"The tri tip is bonkers, the garlic-cilantro sauce is out of this world, and that mango smoothie they've got is next-level refreshing. If I've got time to spare, I'll always stop by this little gem."
934,"If you're hangry and can't wait, don't come to this location. However, if you are hungry....their portions will satisfy you! NOTE: They have an indoor location 3 blocks away! But everyone likes to come to the ""original"", right? Place is a lot smaller than seen in photos. 5 tables, only about 15 chairs total. Definitely a grab and go place, since it's so closely located to the campus. This place is a two-man show (and 3, if you count Pedro, walking around and cleaning up the tables). Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum. DELICIOUS!!! -Chicken is too dry and skimpy slices. -Cilantro garlic sauce wasn't what I had hoped for....it was a bit too creamy and not enough cilantro taste. 1 tri-tip sandwich // YUM! I love the burst of flavors in this compact sandwich. Plentiful of meat juice, meat and sauces. I would eat two of these if I could...Definitely get this one! Pros:+Despite the long lines, the two guys in the kiosk are working their quickest!+Great menu options. I wanted to try everything!!! Cons:-Ehhh. Not exactly worth it to get their smoothies. Mango smoothie was some type of puree blended with ice...-The SO and I agree the tri-tip was really tough to chew. Not unpleasant, but not what we had entirely expected. Tips/Observations:-Water cups available! Just ask at the front.Everything I had expected and wanted to satisfy my weekly splurge. Holding off on a 5 until I can give a try at their other items..."
935,"Where has this pace been all my life... who knew that a tiny shack on the corner of a Berkeley street would house such yummy food?! Yelp was right on with this one. Don't judge a book by its cover or you'll be missing out on one of the tastiest meals you'll ever have! I recommend asking for extra green sauce (if you're a garlic lover like me). Any season, this spot is sure to satisfy!"
936,"Still the great Brazil fresh café as I remembered it. Still got it! If hungry, go for the plate, meat on rice and salad served with a slathering of the garlic green sauce!"
937,"I'll be honest. I'm not from Berkeley. I'm actually no where near Berkeley. But I make a pit stop in Berkeley just for Brazil cafe!! It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? The menu is filled with delicious Dishes and pro tip: don't leave here without trying the tri tip!!! I get the regular rice bowl and my friend gets the combo plate. Both come with rice (btw what is that rice? Never tasted anything like it), tri tip (or your choice of meat), their amazingggg green sauce, a ball of ricotta cheese, and three slices of bread. The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
938,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
939,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
940,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20.

The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."
965,"Brazil Fresh Squeeze Grill's Pedro's Favorite sandwich is now also my favorite.It took several minutes to prepare and serve. The steak inside is legit pieces of good meat. The jalapeños added a kick and the bread was fresh.The Complimentary mango smoothie with your check in was not half-assed just coz it was a freebie.Brazil Fresh Squeeze is a food stand located at the corner of the parking lot of a bike shop but I'm not sure you could actually park at this lot. No worries, there are plenty of street parking available on the streets."
966,"You know that feeling when you're out of food and you're full but you still want more? That's me at Brazil Cafe every single time.Right off the bat, be prepared to wait. The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it. As soon as the mediterranean tri-tip plate was handed to me, the first thing I noticed was how hefty it was. As soon as I opened it, it became clear what was so hefty: a generous helping of rice,  tri-tip, pita, sauce and salad along with the weight of the impending happiness that was about to enter me. The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
967,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food. The staff at the restaurant are friendly, and so are the folks that work here at this location. I discovered that you could order online through yelp24, so do that if you're in a hurry and need to grab and go! Ordering online will save you a bunch of time since they're so popular. This location is closer to campus, so much more convenient. They have a couple of tables and seats outside next to the shack, but they're usually taken. Just head over to campus and find a place to sit outside if it's a nice day and enjoy your yummy food. I got the tri-tip plate, my go to dish, which is probably a go to for many others as well.TL;DR LOVE this place, come and try the tri-tip plate!! (Don't forget to check in on Yelp for their FREE & DELICIOUS mango smoothie!)"
968,"I was looking for a place for lunch in Berkeley when my cousin suddenly remembered this place. She vouched and insisted that the food here is amazing, so I decided that I had to find out for myself.PARKING + AMBIENCEFind street parking around the neighborhood, the cafe is super close to the UC Berkeley campus, so parking can be sparse. The place is a hut located on the side of a bike store parking lot, with parking reserved only for the store customers. Since it's a small hut, there's only a couple of tables placed on the side of the place. The food is all packed into a container, so it's perfect to take to-go.  FOODThe Tri-Tip Plate includes rice, salad, bread, and cilantro garlic sauce. The beef was so tender and juicy! The grilled onions on top of the beef complimented the overall flavor as well. The plate is a huge portion of food, so expect to potentially have leftovers. I didn't finish all bread, the rice and salad was already enough for the base. The cilantro garlic sauce was amazingly flavorful, I mixed it with the hot sauce on the beef, a great combination of sauces for the beef.  Also, don't forget the free mango smoothie when you check-in on Yelp. It's a good refreshment for the big meal. SERVICEThe menu is next to the cashier, so decide on what you want and order right away. They cashier will call on your number when the food is ready for pick up, they will give you the free mango smoothie once you pick up your order.CONCLUSIONNo wonder all the locals rave about this place, it's definitely a UC Berkeley campus favorite and blew my expectations away! No complaints about Brazilian Fresh Squeeze Cafe at all, everything was good; the portions, the price, and the food! It's a must try if you find yourself in the Berkeley area."
969,"Okay, so this business listing is a bit confusing because the pictures posted by the business owner aren't of this location.  This place is a bit bigger than a kiosk and is this tiny shop right along the street.  There's some seating on the side which is great, but a lot of people also seem to take things to go.  The food here is pretty good, I really like the tri tip plate.  The green sauce is fantastic.  FYI, there's a lot of mayo in this so be prepared to feel gross afterward, but it is a tasty meal.  The workers here are friendly enough.  Also, keep in mind that the food takes quite a while to come out here.  Worth a try though if you're out here in Berkeley."
970,Come here for their trip tip sandwich or plate! You will not be disappointed. My bf and I look forward to eating here every time we're in the area. I swear something about their sauce. It's so addicting! And if you love it spicy don't forget to add the habanero hot sauce to your sandwich.
971,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce. Last year, I would come from vallejo to get my mom and plate, and I would keep bringing it to her so that she can get familiar with the sauce and try to replicate it. Although she does a very very very good job at making a mean replica, Brazil cafe still wins lol. Sorry mom. On don't forget! That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"
972,"Amazing, super juicy, tons of flavor tri-tip (I got the Pedro's sandwich, boyfriend got the plate- both amaze). Love the vibe of it being a tiny little shack on the corner with a few outdoor tables. The owner, or whom I believe to be, was super friendly, welcoming all who walked by, giving out samples of delicious meat covered in chimichurri. *Make sure to check into yelp for a free mango smoothie!*"
973,"The tri tip is bonkers, the garlic-cilantro sauce is out of this world, and that mango smoothie they've got is next-level refreshing. If I've got time to spare, I'll always stop by this little gem."
974,"If you're hangry and can't wait, don't come to this location. However, if you are hungry....their portions will satisfy you! NOTE: They have an indoor location 3 blocks away! But everyone likes to come to the ""original"", right? Place is a lot smaller than seen in photos. 5 tables, only about 15 chairs total. Definitely a grab and go place, since it's so closely located to the campus. This place is a two-man show (and 3, if you count Pedro, walking around and cleaning up the tables). Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum. DELICIOUS!!! -Chicken is too dry and skimpy slices. -Cilantro garlic sauce wasn't what I had hoped for....it was a bit too creamy and not enough cilantro taste. 1 tri-tip sandwich // YUM! I love the burst of flavors in this compact sandwich. Plentiful of meat juice, meat and sauces. I would eat two of these if I could...Definitely get this one! Pros:+Despite the long lines, the two guys in the kiosk are working their quickest!+Great menu options. I wanted to try everything!!! Cons:-Ehhh. Not exactly worth it to get their smoothies. Mango smoothie was some type of puree blended with ice...-The SO and I agree the tri-tip was really tough to chew. Not unpleasant, but not what we had entirely expected. Tips/Observations:-Water cups available! Just ask at the front.Everything I had expected and wanted to satisfy my weekly splurge. Holding off on a 5 until I can give a try at their other items..."
975,"Where has this pace been all my life... who knew that a tiny shack on the corner of a Berkeley street would house such yummy food?! Yelp was right on with this one. Don't judge a book by its cover or you'll be missing out on one of the tastiest meals you'll ever have! I recommend asking for extra green sauce (if you're a garlic lover like me). Any season, this spot is sure to satisfy!"
976,"Still the great Brazil fresh café as I remembered it. Still got it! If hungry, go for the plate, meat on rice and salad served with a slathering of the garlic green sauce!"
977,"I'll be honest. I'm not from Berkeley. I'm actually no where near Berkeley. But I make a pit stop in Berkeley just for Brazil cafe!! It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? The menu is filled with delicious Dishes and pro tip: don't leave here without trying the tri tip!!! I get the regular rice bowl and my friend gets the combo plate. Both come with rice (btw what is that rice? Never tasted anything like it), tri tip (or your choice of meat), their amazingggg green sauce, a ball of ricotta cheese, and three slices of bread. The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
978,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
979,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
980,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20. After I came back, the cashier quickly recognized me and gave me my order. Definitely enjoy the transparency of the service."
981,"Wow what a great find thanks to yelp. Needed a cheap, filling, fresh meal and this hit all the spots. I loved my bowl with tri tip, sauce, veggies and pita!  It was amazingly tasty and the extra sauces on the tables were a bonus. Highly recommended."
982,I've had this cafe bookmarked forever but never make the trip out to Berkeley. I managed to go on Memorial Day. Food IMO was nothing I would drive an hour for. The service could be improved and the wait was too long. I was looking most forward to the green sauce I see from the pictures here on Yelp. I make my own version of this sauce so I was curious to try theirs. I like spicy sauces so I was unimpressed when I tried Brazil cafe's as the spice level was basically non-existent to me. Although I'm not quite sure if it's meant to be spicy at all. Did enjoy the cheese or cream in the center of the sauce. And for those who love spicy like I do they had a variety of hot sauces. We ordered #84 Pedro's favorite tri-tip sandwich and the meat combo plate. Paid around $25? The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.
983,"Small, but impressive. My cousins and I were looking for a place to eat that was 1. dog friendly and 2. something that had protein. Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe it was! A quick scan of the Yelp reviews had tri-tip highlighted everywhere and that's exactly what we ordered. As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading. I think those must be from a food truck lot. This location only has a handful of tables).MENUOur group ordered different variations of the Tri-tip (Tri-tip bowl, Tri-tip plate, Tri-tip sandwhich). The only difference between the Tri-tip bowl and plate is that the bowl does not have any side veggies, and is a little smaller than the plate. I would recommend getting the plate if you want those extra greens, since just meat + rice can feel a little heavy. The meat itself was lightly flavored, a little chewy, but still very satisfying. I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."

(Don't forget to check in on Yelp for their FREE & DELICIOUS mango smoothie!)"
1008,"I was looking for a place for lunch in Berkeley when my cousin suddenly remembered this place. She vouched and insisted that the food here is amazing, so I decided that I had to find out for myself.PARKING + AMBIENCEFind street parking around the neighborhood, the cafe is super close to the UC Berkeley campus, so parking can be sparse. The place is a hut located on the side of a bike store parking lot, with parking reserved only for the store customers. Since it's a small hut, there's only a couple of tables placed on the side of the place. The food is all packed into a container, so it's perfect to take to-go.  FOODThe Tri-Tip Plate includes rice, salad, bread, and cilantro garlic sauce. The beef was so tender and juicy! The grilled onions on top of the beef complimented the overall flavor as well. The plate is a huge portion of food, so expect to potentially have leftovers. I didn't finish all bread, the rice and salad was already enough for the base. The cilantro garlic sauce was amazingly flavorful, I mixed it with the hot sauce on the beef, a great combination of sauces for the beef.  Also, don't forget the free mango smoothie when you check-in on Yelp. It's a good refreshment for the big meal. SERVICEThe menu is next to the cashier, so decide on what you want and order right away. They cashier will call on your number when the food is ready for pick up, they will give you the free mango smoothie once you pick up your order.CONCLUSIONNo wonder all the locals rave about this place, it's definitely a UC Berkeley campus favorite and blew my expectations away! No complaints about Brazilian Fresh Squeeze Cafe at all, everything was good; the portions, the price, and the food! It's a must try if you find yourself in the Berkeley area."
1009,"Okay, so this business listing is a bit confusing because the pictures posted by the business owner aren't of this location.  This place is a bit bigger than a kiosk and is this tiny shop right along the street.  There's some seating on the side which is great, but a lot of people also seem to take things to go.  The food here is pretty good, I really like the tri tip plate.  The green sauce is fantastic.  FYI, there's a lot of mayo in this so be prepared to feel gross afterward, but it is a tasty meal.  The workers here are friendly enough.  Also, keep in mind that the food takes quite a while to come out here.  Worth a try though if you're out here in Berkeley."
1010,Come here for their trip tip sandwich or plate! You will not be disappointed. My bf and I look forward to eating here every time we're in the area. I swear something about their sauce. It's so addicting! And if you love it spicy don't forget to add the habanero hot sauce to your sandwich.
1011,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce. Last year, I would come from vallejo to get my mom and plate, and I would keep bringing it to her so that she can get familiar with the sauce and try to replicate it. Although she does a very very very good job at making a mean replica, Brazil cafe still wins lol. Sorry mom. On don't forget! That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"
1012,"Amazing, super juicy, tons of flavor tri-tip (I got the Pedro's sandwich, boyfriend got the plate- both amaze). Love the vibe of it being a tiny little shack on the corner with a few outdoor tables. The owner, or whom I believe to be, was super friendly, welcoming all who walked by, giving out samples of delicious meat covered in chimichurri. *Make sure to check into yelp for a free mango smoothie!*"
1013,"The tri tip is bonkers, the garlic-cilantro sauce is out of this world, and that mango smoothie they've got is next-level refreshing. If I've got time to spare, I'll always stop by this little gem."
1014,"If you're hangry and can't wait, don't come to this location. However, if you are hungry....their portions will satisfy you! NOTE: They have an indoor location 3 blocks away! But everyone likes to come to the ""original"", right? Place is a lot smaller than seen in photos. 5 tables, only about 15 chairs total. Definitely a grab and go place, since it's so closely located to the campus. This place is a two-man show (and 3, if you count Pedro, walking around and cleaning up the tables). Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum. DELICIOUS!!! -Chicken is too dry and skimpy slices. -Cilantro garlic sauce wasn't what I had hoped for....it was a bit too creamy and not enough cilantro taste. 1 tri-tip sandwich // YUM! I love the burst of flavors in this compact sandwich. Plentiful of meat juice, meat and sauces. I would eat two of these if I could...Definitely get this one! Pros:+Despite the long lines, the two guys in the kiosk are working their quickest!+Great menu options. I wanted to try everything!!! Cons:-Ehhh. Not exactly worth it to get their smoothies. Mango smoothie was some type of puree blended with ice...-The SO and I agree the tri-tip was really tough to chew. Not unpleasant, but not what we had entirely expected. Tips/Observations:-Water cups available! Just ask at the front.Everything I had expected and wanted to satisfy my weekly splurge. Holding off on a 5 until I can give a try at their other items..."
1015,"Where has this pace been all my life... who knew that a tiny shack on the corner of a Berkeley street would house such yummy food?! Yelp was right on with this one. Don't judge a book by its cover or you'll be missing out on one of the tastiest meals you'll ever have! I recommend asking for extra green sauce (if you're a garlic lover like me). Any season, this spot is sure to satisfy!"
1016,"Still the great Brazil fresh café as I remembered it. Still got it! If hungry, go for the plate, meat on rice and salad served with a slathering of the garlic green sauce!"
1017,"I'll be honest. I'm not from Berkeley. I'm actually no where near Berkeley. But I make a pit stop in Berkeley just for Brazil cafe!! It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? The menu is filled with delicious Dishes and pro tip: don't leave here without trying the tri tip!!! I get the regular rice bowl and my friend gets the combo plate. Both come with rice (btw what is that rice? Never tasted anything like it), tri tip (or your choice of meat), their amazingggg green sauce, a ball of ricotta cheese, and three slices of bread. The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
1018,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
1019,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
1020,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20. After I came back, the cashier quickly recognized me and gave me my order. Definitely enjoy the transparency of the service."
1021,"Wow what a great find thanks to yelp. Needed a cheap, filling, fresh meal and this hit all the spots. I loved my bowl with tri tip, sauce, veggies and pita!  It was amazingly tasty and the extra sauces on the tables were a bonus. Highly recommended."
1022,I've had this cafe bookmarked forever but never make the trip out to Berkeley. I managed to go on Memorial Day. Food IMO was nothing I would drive an hour for. The service could be improved and the wait was too long. I was looking most forward to the green sauce I see from the pictures here on Yelp. I make my own version of this sauce so I was curious to try theirs. I like spicy sauces so I was unimpressed when I tried Brazil cafe's as the spice level was basically non-existent to me. Although I'm not quite sure if it's meant to be spicy at all. Did enjoy the cheese or cream in the center of the sauce. And for those who love spicy like I do they had a variety of hot sauces. We ordered #84 Pedro's favorite tri-tip sandwich and the meat combo plate. Paid around $25? The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.
1023,"Small, but impressive. My cousins and I were looking for a place to eat that was 1. dog friendly and 2. something that had protein. Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe it was! A quick scan of the Yelp reviews had tri-tip highlighted everywhere and that's exactly what we ordered. As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading. I think those must be from a food truck lot. This location only has a handful of tables).MENUOur group ordered different variations of the Tri-tip (Tri-tip bowl, Tri-tip plate, Tri-tip sandwhich). The only difference between the Tri-tip bowl and plate is that the bowl does not have any side veggies, and is a little smaller than the plate. I would recommend getting the plate if you want those extra greens, since just meat + rice can feel a little heavy. The meat itself was lightly flavored, a little chewy, but still very satisfying. I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."
1024,"First time trying their meal. I ordered their tri-tip salad and it was surprisingly large portion. They put a variety items into the salad and sides, and everything taste great. The staff was really nice and friendly. They also offer u a free tri-tip dipped in cilantro sauce as free sample. Have to say, their cilantro sauce is amazing. The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."
1025,"Brazil Fresh Squeeze Grill's Pedro's Favorite sandwich is now also my favorite.It took several minutes to prepare and serve. The steak inside is legit pieces of good meat. The jalapeños added a kick and the bread was fresh.The Complimentary mango smoothie with your check in was not half-assed just coz it was a freebie.Brazil Fresh Squeeze is a food stand located at the corner of the parking lot of a bike shop but I'm not sure you could actually park at this lot. No worries, there are plenty of street parking available on the streets."
1026,"You know that feeling when you're out of food and you're full but you still want more? That's me at Brazil Cafe every single time.Right off the bat, be prepared to wait. The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it. As soon as the mediterranean tri-tip plate was handed to me, the first thing I noticed was how hefty it was. As soon as I opened it, it became clear what was so hefty: a generous helping of rice,  tri-tip, pita, sauce and salad along with the weight of the impending happiness that was about to enter me. The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
1027,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food. The staff at the restaurant are friendly, and so are the folks that work here at this location. I discovered that you could order online through yelp24, so do that if you're in a hurry and need to grab and go! Ordering online will save you a bunch of time since they're so popular. This location is closer to campus, so much more convenient. They have a couple of tables and seats outside next to the shack, but they're usually taken.

1051,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce. Last year, I would come from vallejo to get my mom and plate, and I would keep bringing it to her so that she can get familiar with the sauce and try to replicate it. Although she does a very very very good job at making a mean replica, Brazil cafe still wins lol. Sorry mom. On don't forget! That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"
1052,"Amazing, super juicy, tons of flavor tri-tip (I got the Pedro's sandwich, boyfriend got the plate- both amaze). Love the vibe of it being a tiny little shack on the corner with a few outdoor tables. The owner, or whom I believe to be, was super friendly, welcoming all who walked by, giving out samples of delicious meat covered in chimichurri. *Make sure to check into yelp for a free mango smoothie!*"
1053,"The tri tip is bonkers, the garlic-cilantro sauce is out of this world, and that mango smoothie they've got is next-level refreshing. If I've got time to spare, I'll always stop by this little gem."
1054,"If you're hangry and can't wait, don't come to this location. However, if you are hungry....their portions will satisfy you! NOTE: They have an indoor location 3 blocks away! But everyone likes to come to the ""original"", right? Place is a lot smaller than seen in photos. 5 tables, only about 15 chairs total. Definitely a grab and go place, since it's so closely located to the campus. This place is a two-man show (and 3, if you count Pedro, walking around and cleaning up the tables). Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum. DELICIOUS!!! -Chicken is too dry and skimpy slices. -Cilantro garlic sauce wasn't what I had hoped for....it was a bit too creamy and not enough cilantro taste. 1 tri-tip sandwich // YUM! I love the burst of flavors in this compact sandwich. Plentiful of meat juice, meat and sauces. I would eat two of these if I could...Definitely get this one! Pros:+Despite the long lines, the two guys in the kiosk are working their quickest!+Great menu options. I wanted to try everything!!! Cons:-Ehhh. Not exactly worth it to get their smoothies. Mango smoothie was some type of puree blended with ice...-The SO and I agree the tri-tip was really tough to chew. Not unpleasant, but not what we had entirely expected. Tips/Observations:-Water cups available! Just ask at the front.Everything I had expected and wanted to satisfy my weekly splurge. Holding off on a 5 until I can give a try at their other items..."
1055,"Where has this pace been all my life... who knew that a tiny shack on the corner of a Berkeley street would house such yummy food?! Yelp was right on with this one. Don't judge a book by its cover or you'll be missing out on one of the tastiest meals you'll ever have! I recommend asking for extra green sauce (if you're a garlic lover like me). Any season, this spot is sure to satisfy!"
1056,"Still the great Brazil fresh café as I remembered it. Still got it! If hungry, go for the plate, meat on rice and salad served with a slathering of the garlic green sauce!"
1057,"I'll be honest. I'm not from Berkeley. I'm actually no where near Berkeley. But I make a pit stop in Berkeley just for Brazil cafe!! It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? The menu is filled with delicious Dishes and pro tip: don't leave here without trying the tri tip!!! I get the regular rice bowl and my friend gets the combo plate. Both come with rice (btw what is that rice? Never tasted anything like it), tri tip (or your choice of meat), their amazingggg green sauce, a ball of ricotta cheese, and three slices of bread. The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
1058,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
1059,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
1060,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20. After I came back, the cashier quickly recognized me and gave me my order. Definitely enjoy the transparency of the service."
1061,"Wow what a great find thanks to yelp. Needed a cheap, filling, fresh meal and this hit all the spots. I loved my bowl with tri tip, sauce, veggies and pita!  It was amazingly tasty and the extra sauces on the tables were a bonus. Highly recommended."
1062,I've had this cafe bookmarked forever but never make the trip out to Berkeley. I managed to go on Memorial Day. Food IMO was nothing I would drive an hour for. The service could be improved and the wait was too long. I was looking most forward to the green sauce I see from the pictures here on Yelp. I make my own version of this sauce so I was curious to try theirs. I like spicy sauces so I was unimpressed when I tried Brazil cafe's as the spice level was basically non-existent to me. Although I'm not quite sure if it's meant to be spicy at all. Did enjoy the cheese or cream in the center of the sauce. And for those who love spicy like I do they had a variety of hot sauces. We ordered #84 Pedro's favorite tri-tip sandwich and the meat combo plate. Paid around $25? The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.
1063,"Small, but impressive. My cousins and I were looking for a place to eat that was 1. dog friendly and 2. something that had protein. Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe it was! A quick scan of the Yelp reviews had tri-tip highlighted everywhere and that's exactly what we ordered. As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading. I think those must be from a food truck lot. This location only has a handful of tables).MENUOur group ordered different variations of the Tri-tip (Tri-tip bowl, Tri-tip plate, Tri-tip sandwhich). The only difference between the Tri-tip bowl and plate is that the bowl does not have any side veggies, and is a little smaller than the plate. I would recommend getting the plate if you want those extra greens, since just meat + rice can feel a little heavy. The meat itself was lightly flavored, a little chewy, but still very satisfying. I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."
1064,"First time trying their meal. I ordered their tri-tip salad and it was surprisingly large portion. They put a variety items into the salad and sides, and everything taste great. The staff was really nice and friendly. They also offer u a free tri-tip dipped in cilantro sauce as free sample. Have to say, their cilantro sauce is amazing. The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."
1065,"Brazil Fresh Squeeze Grill's Pedro's Favorite sandwich is now also my favorite.It took several minutes to prepare and serve. The steak inside is legit pieces of good meat. The jalapeños added a kick and the bread was fresh.The Complimentary mango smoothie with your check in was not half-assed just coz it was a freebie.Brazil Fresh Squeeze is a food stand located at the corner of the parking lot of a bike shop but I'm not sure you could actually park at this lot. No worries, there are plenty of street parking available on the streets."
1066,"You know that feeling when you're out of food and you're full but you still want more? That's me at Brazil Cafe every single time.Right off the bat, be prepared to wait. The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it. As soon as the mediterranean tri-tip plate was handed to me, the first thing I noticed was how hefty it was. As soon as I opened it, it became clear what was so hefty: a generous helping of rice,  tri-tip, pita, sauce and salad along with the weight of the impending happiness that was about to enter me. The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
1067,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food. The staff at the restaurant are friendly, and so are the folks that work here at this location. I discovered that you could order online through yelp24, so do that if you're in a hurry and need to grab and go! Ordering online will save you a bunch of time since they're so popular. This location is closer to campus, so much more convenient. They have a couple of tables and seats outside next to the shack, but they're usually taken. Just head over to campus and find a place to sit outside if it's a nice day and enjoy your yummy food. I got the tri-tip plate, my go to dish, which is probably a go to for many others as well.TL;DR LOVE this place, come and try the tri-tip plate!!

Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum. DELICIOUS!!! -Chicken is too dry and skimpy slices. -Cilantro garlic sauce wasn't what I had hoped for....it was a bit too creamy and not enough cilantro taste. 1 tri-tip sandwich // YUM! I love the burst of flavors in this compact sandwich. Plentiful of meat juice, meat and sauces. I would eat two of these if I could...Definitely get this one! Pros:+Despite the long lines, the two guys in the kiosk are working their quickest!+Great menu options. I wanted to try everything!!! Cons:-Ehhh. Not exactly worth it to get their smoothies. Mango smoothie was some type of puree blended with ice...-The SO and I agree the tri-tip was really tough to chew. Not unpleasant, but not what we had entirely expected. Tips/Observations:-Water cups available! Just ask at the front.Everything I had expected and wanted to satisfy my weekly splurge. Holding off on a 5 until I can give a try at their other items..."
1095,"Where has this pace been all my life... who knew that a tiny shack on the corner of a Berkeley street would house such yummy food?! Yelp was right on with this one. Don't judge a book by its cover or you'll be missing out on one of the tastiest meals you'll ever have! I recommend asking for extra green sauce (if you're a garlic lover like me). Any season, this spot is sure to satisfy!"
1096,"Still the great Brazil fresh café as I remembered it. Still got it! If hungry, go for the plate, meat on rice and salad served with a slathering of the garlic green sauce!"
1097,"I'll be honest. I'm not from Berkeley. I'm actually no where near Berkeley. But I make a pit stop in Berkeley just for Brazil cafe!! It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? The menu is filled with delicious Dishes and pro tip: don't leave here without trying the tri tip!!! I get the regular rice bowl and my friend gets the combo plate. Both come with rice (btw what is that rice? Never tasted anything like it), tri tip (or your choice of meat), their amazingggg green sauce, a ball of ricotta cheese, and three slices of bread. The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
1098,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
1099,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
1100,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20. After I came back, the cashier quickly recognized me and gave me my order. Definitely enjoy the transparency of the service."
1101,"Wow what a great find thanks to yelp. Needed a cheap, filling, fresh meal and this hit all the spots. I loved my bowl with tri tip, sauce, veggies and pita!  It was amazingly tasty and the extra sauces on the tables were a bonus. Highly recommended."
1102,I've had this cafe bookmarked forever but never make the trip out to Berkeley. I managed to go on Memorial Day. Food IMO was nothing I would drive an hour for. The service could be improved and the wait was too long. I was looking most forward to the green sauce I see from the pictures here on Yelp. I make my own version of this sauce so I was curious to try theirs. I like spicy sauces so I was unimpressed when I tried Brazil cafe's as the spice level was basically non-existent to me. Although I'm not quite sure if it's meant to be spicy at all. Did enjoy the cheese or cream in the center of the sauce. And for those who love spicy like I do they had a variety of hot sauces. We ordered #84 Pedro's favorite tri-tip sandwich and the meat combo plate. Paid around $25? The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.
1103,"Small, but impressive. My cousins and I were looking for a place to eat that was 1. dog friendly and 2. something that had protein. Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe it was! A quick scan of the Yelp reviews had tri-tip highlighted everywhere and that's exactly what we ordered. As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading. I think those must be from a food truck lot. This location only has a handful of tables).MENUOur group ordered different variations of the Tri-tip (Tri-tip bowl, Tri-tip plate, Tri-tip sandwhich). The only difference between the Tri-tip bowl and plate is that the bowl does not have any side veggies, and is a little smaller than the plate. I would recommend getting the plate if you want those extra greens, since just meat + rice can feel a little heavy. The meat itself was lightly flavored, a little chewy, but still very satisfying. I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."
1104,"First time trying their meal. I ordered their tri-tip salad and it was surprisingly large portion. They put a variety items into the salad and sides, and everything taste great. The staff was really nice and friendly. They also offer u a free tri-tip dipped in cilantro sauce as free sample. Have to say, their cilantro sauce is amazing. The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."
1105,"Brazil Fresh Squeeze Grill's Pedro's Favorite sandwich is now also my favorite.It took several minutes to prepare and serve. The steak inside is legit pieces of good meat. The jalapeños added a kick and the bread was fresh.The Complimentary mango smoothie with your check in was not half-assed just coz it was a freebie.Brazil Fresh Squeeze is a food stand located at the corner of the parking lot of a bike shop but I'm not sure you could actually park at this lot. No worries, there are plenty of street parking available on the streets."
1106,"You know that feeling when you're out of food and you're full but you still want more? That's me at Brazil Cafe every single time.Right off the bat, be prepared to wait. The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it. As soon as the mediterranean tri-tip plate was handed to me, the first thing I noticed was how hefty it was. As soon as I opened it, it became clear what was so hefty: a generous helping of rice,  tri-tip, pita, sauce and salad along with the weight of the impending happiness that was about to enter me. The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
1107,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food. The staff at the restaurant are friendly, and so are the folks that work here at this location. I discovered that you could order online through yelp24, so do that if you're in a hurry and need to grab and go! Ordering online will save you a bunch of time since they're so popular. This location is closer to campus, so much more convenient. They have a couple of tables and seats outside next to the shack, but they're usually taken. Just head over to campus and find a place to sit outside if it's a nice day and enjoy your yummy food. I got the tri-tip plate, my go to dish, which is probably a go to for many others as well.TL;DR LOVE this place, come and try the tri-tip plate!! (Don't forget to check in on Yelp for their FREE & DELICIOUS mango smoothie!)"
1108,"I was looking for a place for lunch in Berkeley when my cousin suddenly remembered this place. She vouched and insisted that the food here is amazing, so I decided that I had to find out for myself.PARKING + AMBIENCEFind street parking around the neighborhood, the cafe is super close to the UC Berkeley campus, so parking can be sparse. The place is a hut located on the side of a bike store parking lot, with parking reserved only for the store customers. Since it's a small hut, there's only a couple of tables placed on the side of the place. The food is all packed into a container, so it's perfect to take to-go.  FOODThe Tri-Tip Plate includes rice, salad, bread, and cilantro garlic sauce. The beef was so tender and juicy! The grilled onions on top of the beef complimented the overall flavor as well. The plate is a huge portion of food, so expect to potentially have leftovers. I didn't finish all bread, the rice and salad was already enough for the base. The cilantro garlic sauce was amazingly flavorful, I mixed it with the hot sauce on the beef, a great combination of sauces for the beef.  Also, don't forget the free mango smoothie when you check-in on Yelp. It's a good refreshment for the big meal. SERVICEThe menu is next to the cashier, so decide on what you want and order right away. They cashier will call on your number when the food is ready for pick up, they will give you the free mango smoothie once you pick up your order.CONCLUSIONNo wonder all the locals rave about this place, it's definitely a UC Berkeley campus favorite and blew my expectations away! No complaints about Brazilian Fresh Squeeze Cafe at all, everything was good; the portions, the price, and the food! It's a must try if you find yourself in the Berkeley area."
1109,"Okay, so this business listing is a bit confusing because the pictures posted by the business owner aren't of this location.  This place is a bit bigger than a kiosk and is this tiny shop right along the street.  There's some seating on the side which is great, but a lot of people also seem to take things to go.  The food here is pretty good, I really like the tri tip plate.  The green sauce is fantastic.  FYI, there's a lot of mayo in this so be prepared to feel gross afterward, but it is a tasty meal.  The workers here are friendly enough.  Also, keep in mind that the food takes quite a while to come out here.  Worth a try though if you're out here in Berkeley."
1110,Come here for their trip tip sandwich or plate! You will not be disappointed. My bf and I look forward to eating here every time we're in the area. I swear something about their sauce. It's so addicting! And if you love it spicy don't forget to add the habanero hot sauce to your sandwich.
1111,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce. Last year, I would come from vallejo to get my mom and plate, and I would keep bringing it to her so that she can get familiar with the sauce and try to replicate it. Although she does a very very very good job at making a mean replica, Brazil cafe still wins lol. Sorry mom. On don't forget! That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"
1112,"Amazing, super juicy, tons of flavor tri-tip (I got the Pedro's sandwich, boyfriend got the plate- both amaze). Love the vibe of it being a tiny little shack on the corner with a few outdoor tables. The owner, or whom I believe to be, was super friendly, welcoming all who walked by, giving out samples of delicious meat covered in chimichurri. *Make sure to check into yelp for a free mango smoothie!*"
1113,"The tri tip is bonkers, the garlic-cilantro sauce is out of this world, and that mango smoothie they've got is next-level refreshing. If I've got time to spare, I'll always stop by this little gem."

Both come with rice (btw what is that rice? Never tasted anything like it), tri tip (or your choice of meat), their amazingggg green sauce, a ball of ricotta cheese, and three slices of bread. The plate comes with salad too. Oh and topped with onions!! Brazil cafe, I don't know how you do it but you keep getting me to come all the way here for you. Definitely a gem!"
1138,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
1139,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
1140,"I ordered the tri-tip plate that came with rice, tri-tip, salad, bread, and cilantro sauce- one thing's for sure: the cilantro sauce is to die for as it complements the tri-tip perfectly. The rice is a little dry, but the sauce makes up for it. This was my first meal of the day and may be my only because it was just so filling. The mango smoothie was also delicious- make sure to get it free with check in!When ordering the cashier advised me that unfortunately the wait would be a little longer than usual as they were currently preparing a large order. I said that was fine as I could just go back and work some since my office is a short walk from the place, and told her I'd be back in 20. After I came back, the cashier quickly recognized me and gave me my order. Definitely enjoy the transparency of the service."
1141,"Wow what a great find thanks to yelp. Needed a cheap, filling, fresh meal and this hit all the spots. I loved my bowl with tri tip, sauce, veggies and pita!  It was amazingly tasty and the extra sauces on the tables were a bonus. Highly recommended."
1142,I've had this cafe bookmarked forever but never make the trip out to Berkeley. I managed to go on Memorial Day. Food IMO was nothing I would drive an hour for. The service could be improved and the wait was too long. I was looking most forward to the green sauce I see from the pictures here on Yelp. I make my own version of this sauce so I was curious to try theirs. I like spicy sauces so I was unimpressed when I tried Brazil cafe's as the spice level was basically non-existent to me. Although I'm not quite sure if it's meant to be spicy at all. Did enjoy the cheese or cream in the center of the sauce. And for those who love spicy like I do they had a variety of hot sauces. We ordered #84 Pedro's favorite tri-tip sandwich and the meat combo plate. Paid around $25? The side salad was yummy.Although I feel like it wouldn't be worth an hour drive to this place if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot. Food was flavorful (just not spicy lol) and I'm glad I finally got to try it out.
1143,"Small, but impressive. My cousins and I were looking for a place to eat that was 1. dog friendly and 2. something that had protein. Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe it was! A quick scan of the Yelp reviews had tri-tip highlighted everywhere and that's exactly what we ordered. As we were waiting in line to order, Pedro himself came out and exclaimed ""samples for everyone!"" and began to pass out toothpicks with pieces of tri-tip to us. Great service!SETTING-Small shack on University Ave. There are other locations but this is the OG spot. Super colorful. Can't miss it.-Parking lot behind the shack!! and it's free!-Small outdoor seating, pet friendly. (The first couple of pictures on their Yelp page is misleading. I think those must be from a food truck lot. This location only has a handful of tables).MENUOur group ordered different variations of the Tri-tip (Tri-tip bowl, Tri-tip plate, Tri-tip sandwhich). The only difference between the Tri-tip bowl and plate is that the bowl does not have any side veggies, and is a little smaller than the plate. I would recommend getting the plate if you want those extra greens, since just meat + rice can feel a little heavy. The meat itself was lightly flavored, a little chewy, but still very satisfying. I have to say that the sauces in the bowl were bomb. I didn't know what they were but I ate it all. There was a green cilantro based one and this thicker white (cheese based?) one. Super tasty."
1144,"First time trying their meal. I ordered their tri-tip salad and it was surprisingly large portion. They put a variety items into the salad and sides, and everything taste great. The staff was really nice and friendly. They also offer u a free tri-tip dipped in cilantro sauce as free sample. Have to say, their cilantro sauce is amazing. The price is decent in regard to the portion of food they provide. It does take a while for the food to get ready so don't go if you are short in time."
1145,"Brazil Fresh Squeeze Grill's Pedro's Favorite sandwich is now also my favorite.It took several minutes to prepare and serve. The steak inside is legit pieces of good meat. The jalapeños added a kick and the bread was fresh.The Complimentary mango smoothie with your check in was not half-assed just coz it was a freebie.Brazil Fresh Squeeze is a food stand located at the corner of the parking lot of a bike shop but I'm not sure you could actually park at this lot. No worries, there are plenty of street parking available on the streets."
1146,"You know that feeling when you're out of food and you're full but you still want more? That's me at Brazil Cafe every single time.Right off the bat, be prepared to wait. The food took nearly 25 minutes to prepare on a Sunday afternoon at 1:30. Not going to lie, I was getting the grumbles and that's when the crankiness sets in. But I told my stomach to pipe down and be patient (plus I had paid already so there's that too) and boy was it worth it. As soon as the mediterranean tri-tip plate was handed to me, the first thing I noticed was how hefty it was. As soon as I opened it, it became clear what was so hefty: a generous helping of rice,  tri-tip, pita, sauce and salad along with the weight of the impending happiness that was about to enter me. The rice is cooked perfectly so there's still some bite and the beef was tender yet just the right amount of chewy at the same time. As if this wasn't perfect enough, that unassuming sauce is what makes it. Cilantro. Lime. Garlic. Sour Cream. Who knew such a simple combo could have elevated the rice and meat to a whole new level. Normally I'd pass over a salad in a review but even the salad tasted super fresh and light which perfectly balanced out the meat and rice.So my rating? Yes. Just yes. Sign me up for more of this all the time please."
1147,"Love this Brazil Cafe location just as much as I love their restaurant a couple blocks down. There is no difference in the quality and taste of the food. The staff at the restaurant are friendly, and so are the folks that work here at this location. I discovered that you could order online through yelp24, so do that if you're in a hurry and need to grab and go! Ordering online will save you a bunch of time since they're so popular. This location is closer to campus, so much more convenient. They have a couple of tables and seats outside next to the shack, but they're usually taken. Just head over to campus and find a place to sit outside if it's a nice day and enjoy your yummy food. I got the tri-tip plate, my go to dish, which is probably a go to for many others as well.TL;DR LOVE this place, come and try the tri-tip plate!! (Don't forget to check in on Yelp for their FREE & DELICIOUS mango smoothie!)"
1148,"I was looking for a place for lunch in Berkeley when my cousin suddenly remembered this place. She vouched and insisted that the food here is amazing, so I decided that I had to find out for myself.PARKING + AMBIENCEFind street parking around the neighborhood, the cafe is super close to the UC Berkeley campus, so parking can be sparse. The place is a hut located on the side of a bike store parking lot, with parking reserved only for the store customers. Since it's a small hut, there's only a couple of tables placed on the side of the place. The food is all packed into a container, so it's perfect to take to-go.  FOODThe Tri-Tip Plate includes rice, salad, bread, and cilantro garlic sauce. The beef was so tender and juicy! The grilled onions on top of the beef complimented the overall flavor as well. The plate is a huge portion of food, so expect to potentially have leftovers. I didn't finish all bread, the rice and salad was already enough for the base. The cilantro garlic sauce was amazingly flavorful, I mixed it with the hot sauce on the beef, a great combination of sauces for the beef.  Also, don't forget the free mango smoothie when you check-in on Yelp. It's a good refreshment for the big meal. SERVICEThe menu is next to the cashier, so decide on what you want and order right away. They cashier will call on your number when the food is ready for pick up, they will give you the free mango smoothie once you pick up your order.CONCLUSIONNo wonder all the locals rave about this place, it's definitely a UC Berkeley campus favorite and blew my expectations away! No complaints about Brazilian Fresh Squeeze Cafe at all, everything was good; the portions, the price, and the food! It's a must try if you find yourself in the Berkeley area."
1149,"Okay, so this business listing is a bit confusing because the pictures posted by the business owner aren't of this location.  This place is a bit bigger than a kiosk and is this tiny shop right along the street.  There's some seating on the side which is great, but a lot of people also seem to take things to go.  The food here is pretty good, I really like the tri tip plate.  The green sauce is fantastic.  FYI, there's a lot of mayo in this so be prepared to feel gross afterward, but it is a tasty meal.  The workers here are friendly enough.  Also, keep in mind that the food takes quite a while to come out here.  Worth a try though if you're out here in Berkeley."
1150,Come here for their trip tip sandwich or plate! You will not be disappointed. My bf and I look forward to eating here every time we're in the area. I swear something about their sauce. It's so addicting! And if you love it spicy don't forget to add the habanero hot sauce to your sandwich.
1151,"My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 10 years ago. I've been coming here for 10 years and I promise you that I will not stop either. Their tri tip plate is unmatched. Nobody, and I mean nobody can make a better tri tip plate than these guys. That cilantro cream sauce is also something very unique. That's what really makes the plate is the sauce. Last year, I would come from vallejo to get my mom and plate, and I would keep bringing it to her so that she can get familiar with the sauce and try to replicate it. Although she does a very very very good job at making a mean replica, Brazil cafe still wins lol. Sorry mom. On don't forget! That mango smoothie is something I highly recommend to wash down your victorious meal. I f$&?!ing love this place man!Shoutout to Brazil cafe for having el yucateco hot sauce. You guys put me on!"
1152,"Amazing, super juicy, tons of flavor tri-tip (I got the Pedro's sandwich, boyfriend got the plate- both amaze). Love the vibe of it being a tiny little shack on the corner with a few outdoor tables. The owner, or whom I believe to be, was super friendly, welcoming all who walked by, giving out samples of delicious meat covered in chimichurri. *Make sure to check into yelp for a free mango smoothie!*"
1153,"The tri tip is bonkers, the garlic-cilantro sauce is out of this world, and that mango smoothie they've got is next-level refreshing. If I've got time to spare, I'll always stop by this little gem."
1154,"If you're hangry and can't wait, don't come to this location. However, if you are hungry....their portions will satisfy you! NOTE: They have an indoor location 3 blocks away! But everyone likes to come to the ""original"", right? Place is a lot smaller than seen in photos. 5 tables, only about 15 chairs total. Definitely a grab and go place, since it's so closely located to the campus. This place is a two-man show (and 3, if you count Pedro, walking around and cleaning up the tables). Waited about 10 minutes in line, but another 30 for the food. Devour time was about 30-45 minutes. We ordered:1 meat lover plate combination // More like a magical box instead of a plate! Which I love, since most places are stingy when it comes to ""plate"" orders (and charge you so much more). +3 types of meat! Carnita is the star of the show, though they advertise tri-tip. +Rice is DELICIOUS! I never eat all my rice (a shame, I know) but the rice here is REALLY different. It's almost a cross between pilaf rice and sorghum. DELICIOUS!!! -Chicken is too dry and skimpy slices. -Cilantro garlic sauce wasn't what I had hoped for....it was a bit too creamy and not enough cilantro taste. 1 tri-tip sandwich // YUM! I love the burst of flavors in this compact sandwich. Plentiful of meat juice, meat and sauces. I would eat two of these if I could...Definitely get this one! Pros:+Despite the long lines, the two guys in the kiosk are working their quickest!+Great menu options. I wanted to try everything!!! Cons:-Ehhh. Not exactly worth it to get their smoothies. Mango smoothie was some type of puree blended with ice...-The SO and I agree the tri-tip was really tough to chew. Not unpleasant, but not what we had entirely expected. Tips/Observations:-Water cups available! Just ask at the front.Everything I had expected and wanted to satisfy my weekly splurge. Holding off on a 5 until I can give a try at their other items..."
1155,"Where has this pace been all my life... who knew that a tiny shack on the corner of a Berkeley street would house such yummy food?! Yelp was right on with this one. Don't judge a book by its cover or you'll be missing out on one of the tastiest meals you'll ever have! I recommend asking for extra green sauce (if you're a garlic lover like me). Any season, this spot is sure to satisfy!"
1156,"Still the great Brazil fresh café as I remembered it. Still got it! If hungry, go for the plate, meat on rice and salad served with a slathering of the garlic green sauce!"
1157,"I'll be honest. I'm not from Berkeley. I'm actually no where near Berkeley. But I make a pit stop in Berkeley just for Brazil cafe!! It's one of those places that if you haven't had it in a long time, you start to crave it. Anyways, I have only gotten one thing off the menu here every time I've come- I mean, if it ain't broke don't fix it right? The menu is filled with delicious Dishes and pro tip: don't leave here without trying the tri tip!!! I get the regular rice bowl and my friend gets the combo plate.

1158,I come back to Berkeley just to eat at Brazil Cafe. Enough said. Get the tri-tip plate and mango smoothie.
1159,The mango smoothie is okay - would be better if it was a little sweeter and more mango flavor.
