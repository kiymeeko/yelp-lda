0,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
2,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
3,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
4,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
5,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
6,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
7,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
8,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
9,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
10,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
11,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
12,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
13,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
14,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
15,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
16,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
17,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
18,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
19,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"

Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
39,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
40,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
41,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
42,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
43,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
44,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
45,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
46,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
47,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
48,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
49,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
50,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
51,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
52,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
53,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
54,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
55,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
56,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
57,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."

Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
76,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
77,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
78,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
79,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
80,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
81,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
82,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
83,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
84,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
85,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
86,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
87,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
88,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
89,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
90,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
91,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
92,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
93,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
94,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
95,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each.

Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
114,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
115,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
116,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
117,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
118,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
119,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
120,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
121,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
122,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
123,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
124,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
125,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
126,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
127,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
128,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
129,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
130,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
131,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
132,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
133,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately.

EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
153,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
154,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
155,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
156,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
157,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
158,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
159,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
160,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
161,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
162,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
163,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
164,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
165,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
166,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
167,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
168,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
169,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
170,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
171,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
172,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY.

191,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
192,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
193,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
194,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
195,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
196,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
197,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
198,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
199,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
200,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
201,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
202,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
203,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
204,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
205,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
206,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
207,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
208,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
209,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
210,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
211,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it.

Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
229,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
230,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
231,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
232,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
233,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
234,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
235,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
236,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
237,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
238,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
239,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
240,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
241,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
242,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
243,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
244,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
245,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
246,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
247,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"

The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
265,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
266,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
267,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
268,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
269,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
270,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
271,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
272,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
273,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
274,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
275,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
276,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
277,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
278,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
279,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
280,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
281,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
282,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
283,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
284,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much.

The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
304,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
305,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
306,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
307,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
308,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
309,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
310,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
311,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
312,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
313,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
314,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
315,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
316,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
317,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
318,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
319,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
320,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
321,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
322,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."

I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
342,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
343,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
344,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
345,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
346,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
347,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
348,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
349,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
350,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
351,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
352,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
353,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
354,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
355,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
356,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
357,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
358,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
359,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
360,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
361,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."

I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
380,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
381,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
382,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
383,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
384,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
385,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
386,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
387,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
388,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
389,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
390,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
391,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
392,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
393,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
394,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
395,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
396,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
397,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
398,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."

It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
416,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
417,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
418,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
419,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
420,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
421,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
422,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
423,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
424,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
425,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
426,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
427,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
428,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
429,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
430,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
431,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
432,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
433,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
434,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
435,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place.

454,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
455,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
456,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
457,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
458,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
459,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
460,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
461,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
462,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
463,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
464,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
465,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
466,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
467,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
468,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
469,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
470,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
471,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
472,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
473,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."

So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
493,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
494,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
495,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
496,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
497,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
498,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
499,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
500,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
501,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
502,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
503,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
504,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
505,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
506,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
507,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
508,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
509,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
510,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
511,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
512,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did.

Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
532,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
533,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
534,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
535,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
536,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
537,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
538,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
539,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
540,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
541,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
542,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
543,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
544,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
545,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
546,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
547,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
548,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
549,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
550,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
551,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it.

After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
569,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
570,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
571,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
572,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
573,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
574,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
575,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
576,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
577,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
578,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
579,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
580,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
581,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
582,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
583,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
584,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
585,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
586,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
587,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"

605,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
606,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
607,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
608,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
609,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
610,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
611,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
612,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
613,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
614,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
615,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
616,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
617,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
618,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
619,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
620,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
621,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
622,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
623,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
624,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."

The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
644,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
645,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
646,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
647,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
648,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
649,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
650,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
651,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
652,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
653,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
654,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
655,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
656,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
657,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
658,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
659,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
660,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
661,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
662,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."

I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
682,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
683,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
684,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
685,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
686,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
687,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
688,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
689,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
690,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
691,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
692,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
693,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
694,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
695,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
696,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
697,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
698,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
699,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
700,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
701,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."

I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
720,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
721,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
722,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
723,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
724,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
725,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
726,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
727,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
728,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
729,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
730,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
731,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
732,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
733,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
734,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
735,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
736,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
737,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
738,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."

It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
756,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
757,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
758,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
759,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
760,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
761,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
762,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
763,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
764,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
765,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
766,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
767,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
768,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
769,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
770,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
771,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
772,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
773,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
774,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
775,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place.

794,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
795,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
796,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
797,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
798,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
799,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
800,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
801,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
802,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
803,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
804,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
805,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
806,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
807,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
808,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
809,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
810,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
811,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
812,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
813,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."

So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
833,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
834,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
835,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
836,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
837,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
838,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
839,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
840,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
841,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
842,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
843,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
844,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
845,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
846,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
847,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
848,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
849,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
850,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
851,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
852,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did.

Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
872,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
873,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
874,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
875,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
876,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
877,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
878,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
879,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
880,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
881,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
882,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
883,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
884,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
885,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
886,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
887,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
888,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
889,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
890,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
891,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it.

After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
909,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
910,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
911,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
912,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
913,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
914,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
915,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
916,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
917,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
918,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
919,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
920,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
921,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
922,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
923,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
924,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
925,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
926,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
927,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"

945,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
946,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
947,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
948,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
949,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
950,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
951,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
952,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
953,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
954,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
955,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
956,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
957,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
958,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
959,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
960,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
961,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
962,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
963,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
964,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."

The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
984,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
985,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
986,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
987,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
988,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
989,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
990,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
991,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
992,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
993,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
994,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
995,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
996,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
997,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
998,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
999,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1000,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1001,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1002,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."

I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1022,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
1023,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
1024,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
1025,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
1026,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
1027,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
1028,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
1029,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
1030,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
1031,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
1032,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
1033,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
1034,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
1035,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
1036,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
1037,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
1038,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
1039,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1040,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1041,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."

I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1060,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1061,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1062,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
1063,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
1064,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
1065,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
1066,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
1067,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
1068,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
1069,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
1070,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
1071,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
1072,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
1073,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
1074,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
1075,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
1076,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
1077,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
1078,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."

I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
1096,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
1097,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
1098,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
1099,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends!

I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1100,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1101,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1102,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
1103,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
1104,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
1105,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
1106,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
1107,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
1108,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
1109,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
1110,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
1111,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
1112,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
1113,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
1114,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
1115,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place.

After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
1134,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
1135,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
1136,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
1137,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
1138,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
1139,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1140,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1141,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1142,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
1143,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
1144,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
1145,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
1146,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
1147,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
1148,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
1149,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
1150,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
1151,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
1152,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."

Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
1173,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
1174,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
1175,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
1176,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
1177,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
1178,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
1179,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1180,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1181,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1182,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
1183,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
1184,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
1185,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
1186,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
1187,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
1188,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
1189,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
1190,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
1191,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
1192,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula.

We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
1211,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
1212,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
1213,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
1214,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
1215,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
1216,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
1217,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
1218,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
1219,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1220,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1221,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1222,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
1223,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
1224,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
1225,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
1226,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
1227,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
1228,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
1229,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"

1247,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
1248,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
1249,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
1250,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
1251,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
1252,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
1253,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
1254,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
1255,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
1256,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
1257,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
1258,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
1259,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends!

I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1260,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1261,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing.

We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible.

There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1262,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
1263,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
1264,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
1265,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
1266,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."

We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
1285,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
1286,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
1287,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
1288,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
1289,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
1290,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
1291,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
1292,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
1293,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
1294,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
1295,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
1296,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
1297,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
1298,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
1299,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1300,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1301,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1302,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
1303,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag.

There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1322,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
1323,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
1324,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
1325,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
1326,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
1327,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
1328,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
1329,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
1330,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
1331,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
1332,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
1333,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
1334,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
1335,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
1336,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
1337,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
1338,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
1339,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1340,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1341,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."

Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1360,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1361,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1362,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
1363,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
1364,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
1365,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
1366,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
1367,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
1368,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
1369,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
1370,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
1371,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
1372,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
1373,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
1374,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
1375,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
1376,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
1377,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
1378,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
1379,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary.

1396,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
1397,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
1398,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
1399,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends!

I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1400,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1401,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1402,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
1403,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
1404,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
1405,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
1406,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
1407,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
1408,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
1409,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
1410,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
1411,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
1412,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
1413,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
1414,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
1415,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"

1434,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
1435,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
1436,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
1437,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
1438,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
1439,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1440,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1441,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1442,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
1443,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
1444,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
1445,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
1446,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
1447,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
1448,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
1449,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
1450,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
1451,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
1452,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
1453,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."

So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
1473,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
1474,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
1475,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
1476,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
1477,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
1478,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
1479,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1480,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1481,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1482,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
1483,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
1484,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
1485,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
1486,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
1487,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
1488,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
1489,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
1490,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
1491,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
1492,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did.

1511,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
1512,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
1513,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
1514,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
1515,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
1516,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
1517,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
1518,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
1519,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1520,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1521,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1522,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
1523,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
1524,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
1525,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
1526,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
1527,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
1528,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
1529,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
1530,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
1531,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it.

1548,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
1549,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
1550,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
1551,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
1552,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
1553,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
1554,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
1555,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
1556,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
1557,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
1558,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
1559,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1560,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1561,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1562,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
1563,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
1564,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
1565,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
1566,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
1567,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have!

1569,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"

The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
1585,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
1586,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
1587,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
1588,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
1589,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
1590,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
1591,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
1592,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
1593,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
1594,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
1595,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
1596,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
1597,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
1598,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
1599,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends!

I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1600,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1601,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland.

We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1602,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
1603,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
1604,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious.

All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
1623,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
1624,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
1625,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
1626,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
1627,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
1628,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
1629,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
1630,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
1631,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
1632,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
1633,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
1634,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
1635,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
1636,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
1637,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
1638,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
1639,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends!

I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1640,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1641,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1642,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal).

It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1662,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
1663,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
1664,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
1665,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
1666,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
1667,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
1668,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
1669,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
1670,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
1671,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
1672,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
1673,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
1674,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
1675,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
1676,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
1677,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
1678,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
1679,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1680,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1681,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing.

Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
1699,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends!

I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1700,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1701,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1702,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
1703,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
1704,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
1705,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
1706,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
1707,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
1708,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
1709,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
1710,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
1711,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
1712,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
1713,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
1714,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
1715,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
1716,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
1717,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."

Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
1736,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
1737,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
1738,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
1739,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy!

I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1740,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1741,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1742,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
1743,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
1744,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
1745,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
1746,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
1747,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
1748,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
1749,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
1750,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
1751,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
1752,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
1753,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
1754,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
1755,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here.

1773,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
1774,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
1775,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
1776,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
1777,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
1778,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
1779,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1780,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1781,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1782,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
1783,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
1784,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
1785,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
1786,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
1787,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
1788,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
1789,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
1790,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
1791,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
1792,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future.

We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
1813,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
1814,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
1815,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
1816,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
1817,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
1818,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
1819,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1820,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1821,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1822,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
1823,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
1824,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
1825,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
1826,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
1827,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
1828,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
1829,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
1830,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
1831,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
1832,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice.

1849,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
1850,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
1851,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
1852,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
1853,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
1854,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
1855,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
1856,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
1857,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
1858,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
1859,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1860,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1861,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1862,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
1863,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
1864,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
1865,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
1866,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
1867,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
1868,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
1869,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"

This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
1887,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
1888,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
1889,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
1890,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
1891,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
1892,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
1893,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
1894,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
1895,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
1896,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
1897,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
1898,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
1899,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1900,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1901,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1902,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
1903,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
1904,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
1905,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
1906,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."

1909,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"

1924,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
1925,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
1926,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
1927,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
1928,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
1929,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
1930,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
1931,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
1932,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
1933,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
1934,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
1935,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
1936,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
1937,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
1938,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
1939,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1940,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1941,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1942,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
1943,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag.

We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
1962,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
1963,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
1964,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
1965,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
1966,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
1967,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
1968,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
1969,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
1970,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
1971,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
1972,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
1973,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
1974,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
1975,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
1976,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
1977,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
1978,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
1979,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
1980,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
1981,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."

I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
2000,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
2001,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
2002,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
2003,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
2004,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
2005,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
2006,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
2007,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
2008,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
2009,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
2010,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
2011,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
2012,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
2013,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
2014,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
2015,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
2016,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
2017,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
2018,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."

Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
2036,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
2037,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
2038,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
2039,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
2040,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
2041,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
2042,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
2043,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
2044,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
2045,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
2046,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
2047,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
2048,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
2049,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
2050,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
2051,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
2052,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
2053,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
2054,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
2055,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place.

Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
2074,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
2075,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
2076,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
2077,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
2078,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
2079,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
2080,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
2081,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
2082,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
2083,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
2084,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
2085,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
2086,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
2087,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
2088,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
2089,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
2090,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
2091,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
2092,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
2093,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."

Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
2113,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
2114,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
2115,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
2116,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
2117,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
2118,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
2119,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
2120,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
2121,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
2122,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
2123,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
2124,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
2125,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
2126,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
2127,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
2128,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
2129,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
2130,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
2131,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
2132,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula.

We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
2151,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
2152,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
2153,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
2154,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
2155,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
2156,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
2157,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
2158,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
2159,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
2160,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
2161,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
2162,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
2163,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
2164,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
2165,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
2166,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
2167,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
2168,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
2169,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"

2187,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
2188,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
2189,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
2190,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
2191,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
2192,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
2193,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
2194,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
2195,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
2196,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
2197,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
2198,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
2199,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends!

I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
2200,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
2201,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio.

The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
2202,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
2203,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
2204,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
2205,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
2206,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."

We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
2225,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
2226,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
2227,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
2228,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
2229,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
2230,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
2231,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
2232,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
2233,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
2234,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
2235,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
2236,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
2237,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
2238,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
2239,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
2240,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
2241,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
2242,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
2243,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag.

There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
2262,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
2263,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
2264,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
2265,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
2266,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
2267,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
2268,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
2269,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
2270,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
2271,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
2272,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
2273,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
2274,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
2275,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
2276,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
2277,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
2278,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
2279,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends!

I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
2280,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
2281,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."

Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
2300,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
2301,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
2302,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
2303,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
2304,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
2305,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
2306,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
2307,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
2308,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
2309,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
2310,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
2311,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
2312,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
2313,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
2314,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
2315,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
2316,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
2317,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
2318,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
2319,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary.

2336,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
2337,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
2338,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
2339,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends!

I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
2340,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
2341,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
2342,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
2343,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
2344,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
2345,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
2346,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
2347,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
2348,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
2349,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
2350,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
2351,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
2352,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
2353,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
2354,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
2355,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"

2374,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
2375,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
2376,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
2377,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
2378,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
2379,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
2380,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
2381,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
2382,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
2383,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
2384,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
2385,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
2386,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
2387,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
2388,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
2389,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
2390,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
2391,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
2392,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
2393,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."

So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
2413,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
2414,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
2415,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
2416,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
2417,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
2418,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
2419,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
2420,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
2421,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
2422,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
2423,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
2424,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
2425,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
2426,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
2427,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
2428,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
2429,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
2430,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
2431,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
2432,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did.

2451,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
2452,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
2453,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
2454,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
2455,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
2456,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
2457,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
2458,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
2459,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy!

I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
2460,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
2461,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
2462,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
2463,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
2464,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
2465,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
2466,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
2467,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
2468,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
2469,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
2470,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
2471,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it.

2488,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
2489,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
2490,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
2491,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
2492,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
2493,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
2494,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
2495,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
2496,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
2497,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
2498,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
2499,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
2500,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
2501,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
2502,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
2503,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
2504,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
2505,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
2506,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
2507,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap.

2509,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"

The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
2525,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
2526,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
2527,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
2528,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
2529,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
2530,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
2531,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
2532,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
2533,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
2534,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
2535,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
2536,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
2537,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
2538,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
2539,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends!

I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
2540,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
2541,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
2542,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
2543,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
2544,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious.

All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
2563,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
2564,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
2565,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
2566,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
2567,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
2568,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
2569,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
2570,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
2571,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
2572,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
2573,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
2574,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
2575,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
2576,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
2577,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
2578,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
2579,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends!

I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
2580,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
2581,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
2582,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal).

It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
2602,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
2603,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
2604,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
2605,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
2606,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
2607,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
2608,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
2609,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
2610,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
2611,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
2612,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
2613,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
2614,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
2615,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
2616,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
2617,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
2618,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
2619,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
2620,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
2621,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing.

I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland.

Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
2639,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends!

I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
2640,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
2641,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
2642,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
2643,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
2644,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
2645,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
2646,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
2647,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
2648,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
2649,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
2650,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
2651,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
2652,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
2653,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
2654,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
2655,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
2656,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
2657,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."

Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
2676,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
2677,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
2678,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
2679,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends!

I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
2680,"Gray selection of beers, really good pizza and house salads... Don't know why they bother with anti pasta and apps, pizza and salad is where it's at! Their Circa shrimp pizza is incredible. Staff is on point. I've been many times, but most importantly  we had our wedding rehearsal lunch there, we reserved the upstairs but they put us outside in the garden! Fantastic and couldn't have been better!"
2681,"Worst. experience. ever. I was pretty hyped about the place because a lot of friends liked it and the ambiance looked amazing. My girlfriend and I were on a date night and when we got here there was no waiter to direct us where to go. So we just kinda awkwardly sat down in the patio area and waited to order. It wasn't even a particularly busy night and there were plenty of waiters just standing around chatting with each other and the bartender outside on the patio. After an eternity a waiter comes and literally just tosses us two menus and walks away without asking us anything. Fast forward 20 minutes later when we finally got our order in, our waiter actually sneers at the two ladies who just sat down next to us after looking equally confused about the lack of direction. The food was mediocre at best. We got the pizzas which had no flavor and were mostly just dough. I had to pour so much of the seasoning onto my pizza that i may as well just have ate the seasoning by the spoonful. The soup of the day was lumpy and also likewise bland. I thought ordering our food and getting half assed service was bad, but paying was an entirely different animal because at that point both of us just wanted to leave and continue the night elsewhere. We literally watched our waiter walk around doing nothing and chat with all of his friends despite making eye contact multiple times with us signaling we were done. I didn't know that paying for food could be such a chore. To top all of this off, the people playing live music were absolutely terrible. Volume was turned up way too loudly that no one around us could even talk over their meals and they were honestly just banging random keys and various percussion instruments. There were about a grand total of two people who clapped for this ""band"" the rest of us were just thankful they finally stopped playing. All in all a really awful experience and Jupiter gets one star for instagram worthy ambiance."
2682,"Jupiter - 3 Stars: this is a pretty nice little restaurant - sometimes with live entertainment - in downtown Berkeley. On the night we were here they had a three-piece group playing...not too loud, but just enough to be entertaining. Open floor, open door kind of venue...nice experience. The food is ok...nothing remarkable, but a nice place to get a bite and hoist a few beers late into the evening. Our party had a 9"" Cassiopeia (3 star BBQ chicken pizza, hot and fresh), a small Caesar salad (3 star creamy dressing), a meatball appetizer (only 2 stars as we didn't like the sauce the meatballs were baked in), and a hot chocolate (3 stars normal). All-in-all they have nice pizza and a great selection of beer. We really wanted fried chicken wings, but theirs are marinated and baked instead of fried...so we saved a few calories but missed the fried food. Nice place."
2683,"This is such a cute date night or hang out spot.  I love the sitting outside on a warm summer night with the decorative lights.  Inside has a cool old house/pub sort of feel. The pizza is also delicious and great, but on a crowded night, the service can be unbelievable slow.  We waited an 45 before we ordered and about another hour after that before we got our food.  The appetizers also came after the meal, so that was a bit awkward.  This has so much potential to be a 5/5 rating.  Food is great, and everyone is also very friendly, but waiting so long every time can be such a drag. Atmosphere: 5/5Food:4/5Service: 2/5Overall Experience: 3/5"
2684,"Jupiter is a good place to grab a beer on the patio or enjoy some pricy pizza. I decided to do the latter since I'm not a fan of beer and came here for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated immediately around 6:30pm but we did opt to sit indoors. The outdoor patio was super crowded but it did look really nice. Our table was completely crooked next to the window and the table and the utensils were all kind of dirty. The water served also tasted like alcohol, which made it difficult to stay refreshed while eating salty pizza. I know this place is a brewery but I think cleanliness should be bigger of a priority at such an expensive restaurant. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and the Xanthia potato/ricotta/chili flakes pizza with sausage instead of bacon. The garlic bread came out as basically cheesy bread with 2 giant cloves of garlic. The cheese on the bread didn't seem that fresh since it had already hardened a little. I thought they'd at least have some garlic spread on the bread too but it was just the cheese with separate garlic. I wasn't a big fan of this appetizer. The pizza however came out a while after and was delicious. Although it was a bit on the smaller side (13"") for an almost $20 pizza, it was very yummy and delicious. They didn't put much toppings on there though and were very minimal even though they charged so much. The pizza here is good but they don't nearly give you your money's worth, so I don't think I'll be back."
2685,"Very fun spot to catch up with friends over pizza and live music. There's an indoor and outdoor section. The service could use a lot of work, but the place is always busy and no one is in a rush to leave."
2686,"Jupiter is less about the beer and food than it is about the ambience. With a large, two-level interior space, as well as a glorious outdoor patio in the back, this place screams ""first date."" Even then, there's a lot of beer to choose from, all of it pretty decent, and the food is solid too - perhaps a notch or two above typical pub food. This is a busy place, so service isn't going to be the fastest, but if you need to chill with a large group, or get intimate with someone potentially special, you just can't beat the vibe here."
2687,"This was a ""fancy"" restaurant back in my Cal days. This was where you went if you had a date with an older guy, lol. Anyway, i came back post graduate bc I was in the area!The ambience is really nice here. I still LOVE the outdoor patio seating. 5/5The food here is not as good as I remember. I had the salmon salad which I remember being really delicious. It kind of disappointed me now tho. The fish was a bit too smelly and it was missing some flavor it used to have! As always, the service here won't be fast. It's just one of those places you come to sit around and sip your beer/cider/kombucha on tap. Not have your food come out ASAP or be tended to, but that's ok!"
2688,"This is a review of the bar. However, the pizza is amazing here with the side of ranch and deserves another review of its own. Jupiter is one of those places that you want to constantly come back too. Even with a lot of seating upstairs and outside on the patio, Jupiter is constantly busy. After 10:00, Jupiter starts checking ID for the bar. There are so many different type of beers to choose from ciders to lagers. Be warn, there are no cocktails so don't go asking for a cosmos. The patio is self seating and have the best seats of the restaurant. If you are lucky, grab a table next to the fire. If you want something more intimate, upstairs would probably be better. The staff is very nice and is always willing to accommodate people. This time we got the artichoke and spinach dip to share, and it was the perfect appetizer to share. The dip was bubbling, and it came with two hunks of bread to dip into. It was just enough to share between four for a late night snack. Come by Jupiter for some drinks and have an amazing time, or come just for the food, you won't be disappointed."
2689,"This place is perfect. Lots of great beers on tap, plus my friend from Stockton even said he felt home here in a sea full of post/hipsters. The pizza is better than a Trump tax deduction...bring your baby's moma, she won't be disappointed"
2690,"If you're looking for something a bit more intimate, this is your spot. Tables are fairly close together but if you move some chairs around your good. We went in around 1:00 and service was very speedy- beer was served within minutes of sitting down and pizza was delivered shortly after. The ranch might be $1.50 extra but it's so worth it. We chose to sit on the back patio and it was such a beautiful setting for some interesting people watching. Very sweet staff, too.( we ordered the large IO pizza with a side of ranch.) the beers on tap were pretty good, too."
2691,"A great place to get drinks, have small plates, and amazing pizza. Huge selection of beers. I tried the Northern Rasputin with an alcohol percentage of 10% // Strong, but loved it. Enjoyed the shrimp and crab dip, and the Xanthia pizza. There's a huge selection of pizzas, including a surprising amount for vegetarians. Known mainly for the warm, cozy ambiance. It's a great place for co-workers or casual get-togethers especially on Thursday and Friday nights. Plenty of outdoor eating, but make sure to get there early because it's always packed during the weekend. Heated lamps, live music. Very East Bay atmosphere."
2692,"Oh, Jupiter. I have several fond memories of coming here. One of my closest friends and I loved coming here during our undergrad days, and one time, when everyone was gone for Thanksgiving Break, we came here and got our pizzas very quickly.My now-boyfriend and I came here for our first date over a year ago. We got two pizzas, and there was a live band playing, and the date went fantastically. The wait at Venus was too long, so we came here instead, and it was a wonderful choice. This is one of our favorite pizza spots, and when we came another time, we sat outside on a spring evening by the fire pit outside, and it was very cozy.Today, however, we were less than impressed.Maybe it's an off-day, and we had pizza cravings, and so we decided to come back here (because we frequented Pieology and Pasta Bene too often). We got there at 3:00, and we figured it wouldn't be bad of a wait because the lunch rush was over.We ordered Eutropia (one of the regulars we get), and the seasonal veggie pizza with pears and arugula. We regretted deciding to come here for a late lunch.It took 40 minutes to get our order. FORTY. Generally, I give it about 20 minutes to wait for our food in a place like this, and the place still had a good number of customers, but it wasn't a crazy rush.A couple got seated next to us about 10 minutes after we put in our order, AND they got their two pizzas before we did. EXCUSE ME? I'd understand if they got salads or appetizers, but how the heck did their pizzas come out first? One of them was the veggie special, and the other looked meat-based, like our orders. So where the heck were our pizzas?When the waitress came by, I asked her about our order, trying to be as covert as I could with noting that the customers sitting next to us got their pizzas first. She went to the back to ask.I mean, it probably wasn't her fault. Maybe the kitchen forgot about us or something. Or, as my boyfriend said, who knows, maybe she put us in the wrong order. It was already 35 minutes, and we were going to give it 10 more minutes before we leave, because dammit, we should not have to wait 40 minutes for food.When the pizzas came, they were good, but not as outstanding as they've been in the past. The veggie special was interesting, but nothing to write home about. And the Eutropia was kind of burnt and blackened in parts. We waited 40 minutes for this? We gave a small tip, nowhere near the standard 15% tip. I feel bad, but I think giving a tip at all was generous.Really, Jupiter? You can do so much better. I've had way better service here. C'mon, the first time my boyfriend and I came, that was during a crazy dinner hour, AND everything was perfect that night. I'm sure we'll still be back, but not in the near future. You need to step it back up."
2693,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
2694,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
2695,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here.

2713,"The pizza was great but the service was disappointing. We came for dinner on a Tuesday night and were instructed by a sign to seat ourselves. The place was packed. There was live music outside and plenty of live conversations--to say the least, it was loud.We ended up finding a seat inside. After our orders were taken it took quite a while to finally receive our two pizzas, whereas the gentleman sitting next to us who came after us got his pizza immediately. Flagging down a waiter to refill our water took several tries and flagging them down once more to get our bill at the end of the meal was also a tolling act.However, aside from the less than preferable service, the pizza was yummy--especially the crust. You can tell that it came fresh (which probably explains some of the wait for it) and the crust was a good mix of crunch and chewy.Overall, the experience was fine but I don't think the pizza and price made the cut for me to beg to go back."
2714,"This place has been popular ever since my college days. It has a bar up front and a nice little patio in the back. After about 5, the patio gives way to a backyard patio so, even more choices to feast on. We arrived just before that time so, we ordered a couple of drinks. After that, we had a small Caesar, riblets, and a small pizza. The Caesar was light and crisp. The riblets were fall off your bone tender. The odyssey ws (a mushroom pizza) was pretty flavorful. Definitely a great spot for meet ups as well as to kick off any day."
2715,"One of my favorite pizza places.This is actually my second time coming here. I originally went here on a date with my g/f a long time ago and I was so overjoyed to return to this awesome pizza place! There is a parking garage nearby that I usually park at in the area but there is limited street parking as well. Prices are pretty in line with what to expect for a higher quality Artisan pizza place. Service is really good here, though there was a time where the waiter couldn't hear us because of how packed it was and the music but that is just how it goes!Me and my g/f both got a 9"" pizza each. She got the Juno and I got the Cassiopeia. Both were AMAZING! To start, I love spicy food so I was looking forward to trying this pizza. Juno definitely brought the heat!!! Along with a solid amount of marinara and tasty sausages all around, you had a nice balanced with pizza with a kick of spicyness. However to this day my favorite pizza is the Cassiopeia. I swear the song by Dragonland plays in my head when I get this pizza and it is glorious. Onions, cilantro, marinara, mozarella and roasted chicken. Best part? BBQ sauce sprinkled all over. Theres so much flavor in both pizzas and I love the crust on both too. Never burnt and always cooked just right.Anyone who loves pizza and lives in the Bay Area has to try this place. It's a great place to bring the fam, a friend or even go for date night. I forgot to mention that they have a nice selection of beers too. I am forever a fan of you guys, Jupiter!!! :D"
2716,Awesome place. Have been coming here for years and it never disappoints.
2717,"Petaluma Chicken Wings - Soft, subtle flavor, warm, and tender. I didn't notice the garlic and soy so much.Garlic Bread - Basically a layer of cheese melted onto it. They should've called it melted cheese bread.Xanthia - My favorite pizza item. It had slices of potato on it. Carbs on carbs!Aries - Simple, basic pepperoni. Marinara sauce - ""Hot or cold?"" Always order hot to finish off the remaining crust! It was good.Interior - Homey, crowded, cramped, sort of old, wooden surrounding. The patio is nice. Our table overlooked the patio.Service - Good. They noticed we were cold and and glass doors to close behind us."
2718,"Came here on a Friday night. The atmosphere was nice. It was self seated, so we chose a table indoors. They have an outdoor patio with heaters. Restrooms along the hallway. Bouncer in the front to check your ID.I ordered the Jupiter Hefeweizen, safe choice one might think. It was so awful. For $7, it did not taste anything like a hef, more like a bad ale or the bottom of the keg. My friends agreed with me too. That beer just ruined my experiences and expectation of Jupiter.I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe just stick with food instead of beer."
2719,"Chill spot to share pizzas and beers with your friends! They have several draft beers and an impressive menu of foods.artichoke & spinach dip - we couldn't get enough of this creamy dip! served with sourdough and focaccia bread, so delicious!bruschetta - refreshing, the diced marinated roma tomatoes were very sweet.bbq pork riblets - braised in their house Porter and simmered in bbq sauce, these were very tender and juicy! Galileo pizza - zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, garlic, diced tomatoes, fontina & aged asiago on an olive oil crustCassiopeia pizza - roasted chicken breast, sweet yellow onions, fresh cilantro, bbq sauce, mozzarella & marinara. this was the favorite among the whole group!Seasonal Veggie pizza - pears, mozzarella, blue cheese, ricotta, arugula & rosemary. I really enjoyed this one because they also added garlic cloves to the pizza.We walked out with satisfied bellies and garlic breath, and it was all worth it! Everything we had was good and didn't feel too heavy, I'd definitely come back!"
