0,"Tacubaya is a small Mexican restaurant located in an affluent area of Berkeley. Let me start with that I had a new person help me with the register and he not only forgot to give me utensils, my receipt and my number for the server to know where and who the order went to. But, I'm fair and not going to dock (much) a newbie or the restaurant for a new employee.I got the Torta Vegetariano, which was a vegetarian Torta with no cheese. It had a V next to it for Vegan but had cheese on it so I had to request it to be taken off. If you guys haven't heard I've covered to Vega so I no longer eat meat or fish (I never ate cheese).I also got a strawberry agua fresca and it was amazing! I loved the flavor and how fresh it tasted. I felt that they added sugar to it though, but overall it was delicious.The Torta was amazing, I added hella spice to it, but the bread and the vegetables were grilled to perfection. I definitely recommend stopping by and getting a bite to eat! The food came out quick and it was cheap as well.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me, I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
1,"I loved my vegetarian whole bean taco!! Everything was perfectly fresh. I don't mind paying a bit more for fresh & home made corn tortillas made in front of you while you order... BONUS! It's a perfect place to eat for our little jaunts to Madewell, Lulu & Anthropologie in Berkeley. This is a stand in line , order, get a number & sit down cafe. They were quick & pleasant with their system. Our Modesto stand in line to order & sit w/a number for delivery should take note! My daughter ordered the chicken enchiladas.. they were beautiful and made w/homemade corn tortillas as well. My daughter found a rather large vein googly thing in her chicken and she asked what it was... they immediately offered to remake. Love that! But we were out of time, so we said no. Without even telling us, they took them off our tab and refunded us!! Whoa. Customers matter! They didn't have to do that, after all it was her 2nd enchilada.... def. will be back! And, the homemade quacamole w/ homemade tortilla chips made to order... yummmmy!!! Reminds me of Santa Barbara restaurants. :)"
2,"66% RATIO OF HAIR TO BITES!This place is generally okay.  It's a bit bland for Mexican food, but it's not awful and usually fresh and sanitary.  BUT .... yesterday I ordered a shrimp ceviche special and was about two bites in before my friend noticed a HAIR IN MY FOOD, glimmering in the afternoon sunlight.  Gross!  I looked at the line, and it was super crowded and started thinking ""Hmmm, maybe ONE HAIR won't kill me.""  So, against my better judgment (and in the midst of my friend silently judging my choice) and because I have worked in a restaurant before, I was going to let it go.Until I found a SECOND HAIR!  This hair was NOT lying on top, having blown over by the Berkeley wind.  It was clearly MIXED IN to the food!  So, that's too much, right - three bites and two hairs???  (For those counting, it's 66% of bites with hair.)So, I return it - fine they will take it off my bill.  SO HERE IS THE REALLY TERRIBLE PART - - - BEFORE ORDERING THE CEVICHE, i ASKED IF IT WAS ALREADY MADE, (because I would have liked to omit something), and they said YES, so NOT MADE TO ORDER.  I got it anyway.  The people ordering it after I returned the hairy mess also got it, and the people after them, and so on, and so on, because the kitchen DID NOT THROW IT OUT!Here's an interesting twist - none of the chefs working that day had hair that length so, I think the hair happened in prep, not that it matters but it wasn't the guys there to blame.  Would I like something else?  Again, against my better judgment I ask for a carne asada taco (for which I was charged - no apology taco?)  Anyway, underseasoned, boring asada, but edible and HAIRLESS, so bonus!  Seriously, if y'all ever go to Mexico City - it will kill this place for you.  Not worth the wait, the money, or the effort to locate random hairs.P.S. BUSSING MY OWN TABLE:I also had to go and get a shift towel and wipe down our table before we seated ourselves because the people working there only wipe one table down out of three, and ours was not the lucky winner (apparently hadn't been in several hours, given the dried salsas and such on it.)  So much for the tip I added to my card!"
3,"Stopped by here for a late lunch during the 4th street fair. This is the type of place where you order at the register and give you a number. There is outside and plenty of indoor seating. For food we ordered 2 vegetarian tacos, quesadilla for the lil one and hubby got a spring mixed salad with pepino seeds. Hubby's salad with refreshing, my vegetarian taco with whole pinto beans was good but not worth raving, I could have made something like this at home. If you want chips and salsa, that's extra to buy. I hear the churros here are the bomb, must try next time."
4,"Tacubaya is my fourth street staple and something to always look forward to amid the challenge of looking for a parking spot! Great menu, affordable for the area, and super flavorful food! I did take out and ordered two crispy chicken tacos, one taco al pastor, and a pork tamal. The pastor was not overly greasy, it was crispy yet tender, and was delicious with the fresh tortilla and guacamole! The pork tamal really blew my mind--covered in a dark mole, the masa to pork ratio was perfect, and the pork was very flavorful. Will definitely go back for the tamal! If you are looking for quality Mexican with California freshness, go to Tacubaya! Casual, order at the counter, and good food!!!"
5,"2.5 -but the staff was super nice. Came here for lunch today. The place was hopping with business and there is plenty of room for seating . All staff was friendly, helpful and efficient and the establishment was very clean. We ordered chips and salsa, beef enchiladas and a tostada with sweet potatoes and chicken. The chips were thick and very hard and the salsa was just generic with little to no flavor. The enchilada was better, but again- lacked flavor. Nothing special about it. The tostada was not good and the meat was tough - although it had more flavor than the rest. I don't think I would come here again.  Meh..just OK."
6,"The battered & fried pollock, fish, $4.15,  and pork, $4 street tacos were delicious, perfectly cooked and served hot. My wife had a delicious made to order Chili Relleno $8.75. expensive but worth it."
7,"This was our first visit  The chicken enchiladas were delicious. The meat was moist, tender and flavorful even without the sauce. The enchilada sauce was the right consistency, flavorful and not salty. The steak on the taco was grilled and flavorful. I guess you can see that I use the word 'flavorful' three times already! Some places use too much salt to try to enhance the taste of the food, but they did not do that. I would come back in a flash. There's a free public parking lot next to the restaurant and metered parking on the street."
8,"Great casual eatery with tasty offerings. Thursday 7p.m. dinner time with plenty of folks enjoying their meals. Luckily, there was no line at the order counter. My friend suggested tortilla soup and horchata. She also got a torta and a carne asada taco. Nice rich flavored soup. I'll look forward to another visit when I'm hangry. I was still full from the buffet lunch at Galeto Brazilian Steakhouse in Oakland!  Staff were helpful and pleasant."
9,"I've been coming here for a few years, but this is my first time writing a review about this place. I work down the street from here and   a coworker of mine told me about it. The food here is pretty good, everything is made fresh. Especially their tortillas, I love the taste of fresh warm tortillas. It's so soft and delicious.I've gotten the ""papas con crema"" which is basically potato fritters with cheese inside of it and a drizzle of sour cream on top. That one is really good as well. But my most favorite that I always get is either the tuna ceviche or shrimp ceviche with fresh fried tortilla chips. I actually tried their fish tacos for the first time and I thought it was ok. I feel like it needs a little bit more flavor. It was sort of bland. And the aioli sauce didn't have much taste to it neither. I guess I was comparing it to Rubio's.Anyways the ambience is nice and clean. You could also watch them make your food because the kitchen is visible. My only problem with this place is I can never call in my order. I usually come here on my lunch break and it would make it so much better if I can call in my order so I can just be in and out and enjoy my lunch without feeling so rushed. But for some reason they never answer their phones. I understand that they can be busy sometimes but every time I've came on my lunch there's no line and I've asked them why weren't they answering their phones. Sometimes they say that they were  busy and it just died down or one time they didn't even know where the phone was at. It would be nice if I can just call in my order and just pick it up without having to wait. However the food has me coming back for more. I definitely recommend this place."
10,"I hardly write reviews but the service here has been poor consistently and not worth the price you pay.  An attitude of ""There will be someone behind you in line anyways"".  Avoid."
11,"Welp.  When you charge $9 for one Chile relleno, it better be amazing.  Meh food for omg this is life-changing prices loses you a few stars :("
12,"Ate dinner snack here. Chili relleno and chips and salsa. Tasted good. Decor after cinco de mayo. Self seating, order your items, get number, and they bring to your table. Parking on the street after 6pm free else 2 hours limit daytime."
13,"I've always had this love hate relationship with this place. I think it's because Richmond has cheap Mexican eats. This place is seated in the busy 4th Street strip in Berkeley. So I get it, it's shi-shi Mexican food, even though there's nothing in particular that sets it apart from the cheaper places, in my mind, except for location and handmade tortillas all the time. I've had fish tacos here, the crispy pollo tacos, the tortilla soup-- umm didn't like that. And the other day got one sopa de chorizo y papas. That's pretty yummy. I think the sopa shell was a lil crunchy for my liking. I'd rather have it be a lil denser. Also one sopa is $6.95. Yikes!And finally you gotta buy chips and salsa separately. Ya ya fine fine.The food's okay-- it's not spectacular. The line moves fast though, you're not going to wait an hour for a table, like at Bette's down the street."
14,The quality of food was not good. The cashier was very rude. I won't ever go here. Had soft and crispy taco. None was good. Enchilada with raw chicken. Guacamole not bad.
15,"Lengua is so so, kinda pricey for one taco. Tamal has good flavors, kinda salty though. The mole has a bit of a kick. The chips and salsa was salty and hard, wish it had other salsa to dip in. Location is in a nice spot, parking and what not. Food comes out super fast."
16,Underwhelming tacos for premium prices.  That might as well be the ad slogan.  Can't say the good was bad (though the chips were hard enough to worry about breaking a tooth).  But I can't say this was rewarding food either.  Just mostly flavorless meh.  Very disappointing.
17,"I was (probably delusional) optimist about this place off the 4th street shopping center for a quick-ish bite to eat. After standing in line for a good long while, we settled on tacos and enchiladas. Food looked good, prices are a bit much for how small the portions are (avoid the non-alcoholic drinks at all cost... they are crazy expensive which we learned the hard way). Waited a while for our food, and man... that was a disappointment. It didn't taste bad. It just tasted meh. The asada is meat, so I supposes it's not false advertising. But if anyone has ever had actually good carna asada... this is no where close. The enchiladas were better than the tacos, but still that's not saying much. We could have gotten the same tastes at an American ""Mexican"" chain restaurant. Won't be back. Bummer."
18,"I went here based on my sister's past visits and I was disappointed!  I decided to try something totally different and I had the sope.  It was awesome - a crispy corn cake with potatoes,  chorizo,  and black beans.  It doesn't look big but it is filling!  Now,  I'm on a, mission to find sopes in my neighborhood but I fear they may not be as good as Tacubayas!  Good job guys and thank you for introducing me to something new.  On a side note,  my sister also recommended the home made churros."
19,"Love this place. Every time we come here it's delicious. Wonderful service. So authentic. Chilaquiles is one of my favorites, menudo y friholes. Mmm"

48,"Great casual eatery with tasty offerings. Thursday 7p.m. dinner time with plenty of folks enjoying their meals. Luckily, there was no line at the order counter. My friend suggested tortilla soup and horchata. She also got a torta and a carne asada taco. Nice rich flavored soup. I'll look forward to another visit when I'm hangry. I was still full from the buffet lunch at Galeto Brazilian Steakhouse in Oakland!  Staff were helpful and pleasant."
49,"I've been coming here for a few years, but this is my first time writing a review about this place. I work down the street from here and   a coworker of mine told me about it. The food here is pretty good, everything is made fresh. Especially their tortillas, I love the taste of fresh warm tortillas. It's so soft and delicious.I've gotten the ""papas con crema"" which is basically potato fritters with cheese inside of it and a drizzle of sour cream on top. That one is really good as well. But my most favorite that I always get is either the tuna ceviche or shrimp ceviche with fresh fried tortilla chips. I actually tried their fish tacos for the first time and I thought it was ok. I feel like it needs a little bit more flavor. It was sort of bland. And the aioli sauce didn't have much taste to it neither. I guess I was comparing it to Rubio's.Anyways the ambience is nice and clean. You could also watch them make your food because the kitchen is visible. My only problem with this place is I can never call in my order. I usually come here on my lunch break and it would make it so much better if I can call in my order so I can just be in and out and enjoy my lunch without feeling so rushed. But for some reason they never answer their phones. I understand that they can be busy sometimes but every time I've came on my lunch there's no line and I've asked them why weren't they answering their phones. Sometimes they say that they were  busy and it just died down or one time they didn't even know where the phone was at. It would be nice if I can just call in my order and just pick it up without having to wait. However the food has me coming back for more. I definitely recommend this place."
50,"I hardly write reviews but the service here has been poor consistently and not worth the price you pay.  An attitude of ""There will be someone behind you in line anyways"".  Avoid."
51,"Welp.  When you charge $9 for one Chile relleno, it better be amazing.  Meh food for omg this is life-changing prices loses you a few stars :("

56,Underwhelming tacos for premium prices.  That might as well be the ad slogan.  Can't say the good was bad (though the chips were hard enough to worry about breaking a tooth).  But I can't say this was rewarding food either.  Just mostly flavorless meh.  Very disappointing.
57,"I was (probably delusional) optimist about this place off the 4th street shopping center for a quick-ish bite to eat.

58,"I went here based on my sister's past visits and I was disappointed!  I decided to try something totally different and I had the sope.  It was awesome - a crispy corn cake with potatoes,  chorizo,  and black beans.  It doesn't look big but it is filling!  Now,  I'm on a, mission to find sopes in my neighborhood but I fear they may not be as good as Tacubayas!  Good job guys and thank you for introducing me to something new.  On a side note,  my sister also recommended the home made churros."

60,"Tacubaya is a small Mexican restaurant located in an affluent area of Berkeley. Let me start with that I had a new person help me with the register and he not only forgot to give me utensils, my receipt and my number for the server to know where and who the order went to. But, I'm fair and not going to dock (much) a newbie or the restaurant for a new employee.I got the Torta Vegetariano, which was a vegetarian Torta with no cheese. It had a V next to it for Vegan but had cheese on it so I had to request it to be taken off. If you guys haven't heard I've covered to Vega so I no longer eat meat or fish (I never ate cheese).I also got a strawberry agua fresca and it was amazing! I loved the flavor and how fresh it tasted. I felt that they added sugar to it though, but overall it was delicious.The Torta was amazing, I added hella spice to it, but the bread and the vegetables were grilled to perfection. I definitely recommend stopping by and getting a bite to eat! The food came out quick and it was cheap as well.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me, I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
61,"I loved my vegetarian whole bean taco!! Everything was perfectly fresh. I don't mind paying a bit more for fresh & home made corn tortillas made in front of you while you order... BONUS! It's a perfect place to eat for our little jaunts to Madewell, Lulu & Anthropologie in Berkeley. This is a stand in line , order, get a number & sit down cafe. They were quick & pleasant with their system. Our Modesto stand in line to order & sit w/a number for delivery should take note! My daughter ordered the chicken enchiladas.. they were beautiful and made w/homemade corn tortillas as well. My daughter found a rather large vein googly thing in her chicken and she asked what it was... they immediately offered to remake. Love that! But we were out of time, so we said no. Without even telling us, they took them off our tab and refunded us!! Whoa. Customers matter! They didn't have to do that, after all it was her 2nd enchilada.... def. will be back! And, the homemade quacamole w/ homemade tortilla chips made to order... yummmmy!!! Reminds me of Santa Barbara restaurants. :)"
62,"66% RATIO OF HAIR TO BITES!This place is generally okay.  It's a bit bland for Mexican food, but it's not awful and usually fresh and sanitary.  BUT .... yesterday I ordered a shrimp ceviche special and was about two bites in before my friend noticed a HAIR IN MY FOOD, glimmering in the afternoon sunlight.  Gross!  I looked at the line, and it was super crowded and started thinking ""Hmmm, maybe ONE HAIR won't kill me.""  So, against my better judgment (and in the midst of my friend silently judging my choice) and because I have worked in a restaurant before, I was going to let it go.Until I found a SECOND HAIR!  This hair was NOT lying on top, having blown over by the Berkeley wind.  It was clearly MIXED IN to the food!  So, that's too much, right - three bites and two hairs???  (For those counting, it's 66% of bites with hair.)So, I return it - fine they will take it off my bill.  SO HERE IS THE REALLY TERRIBLE PART - - - BEFORE ORDERING THE CEVICHE, i ASKED IF IT WAS ALREADY MADE, (because I would have liked to omit something), and they said YES, so NOT MADE TO ORDER.  I got it anyway.  The people ordering it after I returned the hairy mess also got it, and the people after them, and so on, and so on, because the kitchen DID NOT THROW IT OUT!Here's an interesting twist - none of the chefs working that day had hair that length so, I think the hair happened in prep, not that it matters but it wasn't the guys there to blame.  Would I like something else?  Again, against my better judgment I ask for a carne asada taco (for which I was charged - no apology taco?)  Anyway, underseasoned, boring asada, but edible and HAIRLESS, so bonus!  Seriously, if y'all ever go to Mexico City - it will kill this place for you.  Not worth the wait, the money, or the effort to locate random hairs.P.S. BUSSING MY OWN TABLE:I also had to go and get a shift towel and wipe down our table before we seated ourselves because the people working there only wipe one table down out of three, and ours was not the lucky winner (apparently hadn't been in several hours, given the dried salsas and such on it.)  So much for the tip I added to my card!"
63,"Stopped by here for a late lunch during the 4th street fair. This is the type of place where you order at the register and give you a number. There is outside and plenty of indoor seating. For food we ordered 2 vegetarian tacos, quesadilla for the lil one and hubby got a spring mixed salad with pepino seeds. Hubby's salad with refreshing, my vegetarian taco with whole pinto beans was good but not worth raving, I could have made something like this at home. If you want chips and salsa, that's extra to buy. I hear the churros here are the bomb, must try next time."
64,"Tacubaya is my fourth street staple and something to always look forward to amid the challenge of looking for a parking spot! Great menu, affordable for the area, and super flavorful food! I did take out and ordered two crispy chicken tacos, one taco al pastor, and a pork tamal. The pastor was not overly greasy, it was crispy yet tender, and was delicious with the fresh tortilla and guacamole! The pork tamal really blew my mind--covered in a dark mole, the masa to pork ratio was perfect, and the pork was very flavorful. Will definitely go back for the tamal! If you are looking for quality Mexican with California freshness, go to Tacubaya! Casual, order at the counter, and good food!!!"
65,"2.5 -but the staff was super nice. Came here for lunch today. The place was hopping with business and there is plenty of room for seating . All staff was friendly, helpful and efficient and the establishment was very clean. We ordered chips and salsa, beef enchiladas and a tostada with sweet potatoes and chicken. The chips were thick and very hard and the salsa was just generic with little to no flavor. The enchilada was better, but again- lacked flavor. Nothing special about it. The tostada was not good and the meat was tough - although it had more flavor than the rest. I don't think I would come here again.  Meh..just OK."
66,"The battered & fried pollock, fish, $4.15,  and pork, $4 street tacos were delicious, perfectly cooked and served hot. My wife had a delicious made to order Chili Relleno $8.75. expensive but worth it."

But, I'm fair and not going to dock (much) a newbie or the restaurant for a new employee.I got the Torta Vegetariano, which was a vegetarian Torta with no cheese. It had a V next to it for Vegan but had cheese on it so I had to request it to be taken off. If you guys haven't heard I've covered to Vega so I no longer eat meat or fish (I never ate cheese).I also got a strawberry agua fresca and it was amazing! I loved the flavor and how fresh it tasted. I felt that they added sugar to it though, but overall it was delicious.The Torta was amazing, I added hella spice to it, but the bread and the vegetables were grilled to perfection. I definitely recommend stopping by and getting a bite to eat! The food came out quick and it was cheap as well.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me, I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
101,"I loved my vegetarian whole bean taco!! Everything was perfectly fresh. I don't mind paying a bit more for fresh & home made corn tortillas made in front of you while you order... BONUS! It's a perfect place to eat for our little jaunts to Madewell, Lulu & Anthropologie in Berkeley. This is a stand in line , order, get a number & sit down cafe. They were quick & pleasant with their system. Our Modesto stand in line to order & sit w/a number for delivery should take note! My daughter ordered the chicken enchiladas.. they were beautiful and made w/homemade corn tortillas as well. My daughter found a rather large vein googly thing in her chicken and she asked what it was... they immediately offered to remake. Love that! But we were out of time, so we said no. Without even telling us, they took them off our tab and refunded us!! Whoa. Customers matter! They didn't have to do that, after all it was her 2nd enchilada.... def. will be back! And, the homemade quacamole w/ homemade tortilla chips made to order... yummmmy!!! Reminds me of Santa Barbara restaurants. :)"
102,"66% RATIO OF HAIR TO BITES!This place is generally okay.  It's a bit bland for Mexican food, but it's not awful and usually fresh and sanitary.  BUT .... yesterday I ordered a shrimp ceviche special and was about two bites in before my friend noticed a HAIR IN MY FOOD, glimmering in the afternoon sunlight.  Gross!  I looked at the line, and it was super crowded and started thinking ""Hmmm, maybe ONE HAIR won't kill me.""  So, against my better judgment (and in the midst of my friend silently judging my choice) and because I have worked in a restaurant before, I was going to let it go.Until I found a SECOND HAIR!  This hair was NOT lying on top, having blown over by the Berkeley wind.  It was clearly MIXED IN to the food!  So, that's too much, right - three bites and two hairs???  (For those counting, it's 66% of bites with hair.)So, I return it - fine they will take it off my bill.  SO HERE IS THE REALLY TERRIBLE PART - - - BEFORE ORDERING THE CEVICHE, i ASKED IF IT WAS ALREADY MADE, (because I would have liked to omit something), and they said YES, so NOT MADE TO ORDER.  I got it anyway.  The people ordering it after I returned the hairy mess also got it, and the people after them, and so on, and so on, because the kitchen DID NOT THROW IT OUT!Here's an interesting twist - none of the chefs working that day had hair that length so, I think the hair happened in prep, not that it matters but it wasn't the guys there to blame.  Would I like something else?  Again, against my better judgment I ask for a carne asada taco (for which I was charged - no apology taco?)  Anyway, underseasoned, boring asada, but edible and HAIRLESS, so bonus!  Seriously, if y'all ever go to Mexico City - it will kill this place for you.  Not worth the wait, the money, or the effort to locate random hairs.P.S. BUSSING MY OWN TABLE:I also had to go and get a shift towel and wipe down our table before we seated ourselves because the people working there only wipe one table down out of three, and ours was not the lucky winner (apparently hadn't been in several hours, given the dried salsas and such on it.)  So much for the tip I added to my card!"
103,"Stopped by here for a late lunch during the 4th street fair. This is the type of place where you order at the register and give you a number. There is outside and plenty of indoor seating. For food we ordered 2 vegetarian tacos, quesadilla for the lil one and hubby got a spring mixed salad with pepino seeds. Hubby's salad with refreshing, my vegetarian taco with whole pinto beans was good but not worth raving, I could have made something like this at home. If you want chips and salsa, that's extra to buy. I hear the churros here are the bomb, must try next time."
104,"Tacubaya is my fourth street staple and something to always look forward to amid the challenge of looking for a parking spot! Great menu, affordable for the area, and super flavorful food! I did take out and ordered two crispy chicken tacos, one taco al pastor, and a pork tamal. The pastor was not overly greasy, it was crispy yet tender, and was delicious with the fresh tortilla and guacamole! The pork tamal really blew my mind--covered in a dark mole, the masa to pork ratio was perfect, and the pork was very flavorful. Will definitely go back for the tamal! If you are looking for quality Mexican with California freshness, go to Tacubaya! Casual, order at the counter, and good food!!!"
105,"2.5 -but the staff was super nice. Came here for lunch today. The place was hopping with business and there is plenty of room for seating . All staff was friendly, helpful and efficient and the establishment was very clean. We ordered chips and salsa, beef enchiladas and a tostada with sweet potatoes and chicken. The chips were thick and very hard and the salsa was just generic with little to no flavor. The enchilada was better, but again- lacked flavor. Nothing special about it. The tostada was not good and the meat was tough - although it had more flavor than the rest. I don't think I would come here again.  Meh..just OK."
106,"The battered & fried pollock, fish, $4.15,  and pork, $4 street tacos were delicious, perfectly cooked and served hot. My wife had a delicious made to order Chili Relleno $8.75. expensive but worth it."
107,"This was our first visit  The chicken enchiladas were delicious. The meat was moist, tender and flavorful even without the sauce. The enchilada sauce was the right consistency, flavorful and not salty. The steak on the taco was grilled and flavorful. I guess you can see that I use the word 'flavorful' three times already! Some places use too much salt to try to enhance the taste of the food, but they did not do that. I would come back in a flash. There's a free public parking lot next to the restaurant and metered parking on the street."
108,"Great casual eatery with tasty offerings. Thursday 7p.m. dinner time with plenty of folks enjoying their meals. Luckily, there was no line at the order counter. My friend suggested tortilla soup and horchata. She also got a torta and a carne asada taco. Nice rich flavored soup. I'll look forward to another visit when I'm hangry. I was still full from the buffet lunch at Galeto Brazilian Steakhouse in Oakland!  Staff were helpful and pleasant."
109,"I've been coming here for a few years, but this is my first time writing a review about this place. I work down the street from here and   a coworker of mine told me about it. The food here is pretty good, everything is made fresh. Especially their tortillas, I love the taste of fresh warm tortillas. It's so soft and delicious.I've gotten the ""papas con crema"" which is basically potato fritters with cheese inside of it and a drizzle of sour cream on top. That one is really good as well. But my most favorite that I always get is either the tuna ceviche or shrimp ceviche with fresh fried tortilla chips. I actually tried their fish tacos for the first time and I thought it was ok. I feel like it needs a little bit more flavor. It was sort of bland. And the aioli sauce didn't have much taste to it neither. I guess I was comparing it to Rubio's.Anyways the ambience is nice and clean. You could also watch them make your food because the kitchen is visible. My only problem with this place is I can never call in my order. I usually come here on my lunch break and it would make it so much better if I can call in my order so I can just be in and out and enjoy my lunch without feeling so rushed. But for some reason they never answer their phones. I understand that they can be busy sometimes but every time I've came on my lunch there's no line and I've asked them why weren't they answering their phones. Sometimes they say that they were  busy and it just died down or one time they didn't even know where the phone was at. It would be nice if I can just call in my order and just pick it up without having to wait. However the food has me coming back for more. I definitely recommend this place."
110,"I hardly write reviews but the service here has been poor consistently and not worth the price you pay.  An attitude of ""There will be someone behind you in line anyways"".  Avoid."
111,"Welp.  When you charge $9 for one Chile relleno, it better be amazing.  Meh food for omg this is life-changing prices loses you a few stars :("
112,"Ate dinner snack here. Chili relleno and chips and salsa. Tasted good. Decor after cinco de mayo. Self seating, order your items, get number, and they bring to your table. Parking on the street after 6pm free else 2 hours limit daytime."
113,"I've always had this love hate relationship with this place. I think it's because Richmond has cheap Mexican eats. This place is seated in the busy 4th Street strip in Berkeley. So I get it, it's shi-shi Mexican food, even though there's nothing in particular that sets it apart from the cheaper places, in my mind, except for location and handmade tortillas all the time. I've had fish tacos here, the crispy pollo tacos, the tortilla soup-- umm didn't like that. And the other day got one sopa de chorizo y papas. That's pretty yummy. I think the sopa shell was a lil crunchy for my liking. I'd rather have it be a lil denser. Also one sopa is $6.95. Yikes!And finally you gotta buy chips and salsa separately. Ya ya fine fine.The food's okay-- it's not spectacular. The line moves fast though, you're not going to wait an hour for a table, like at Bette's down the street."
114,The quality of food was not good. The cashier was very rude. I won't ever go here. Had soft and crispy taco. None was good. Enchilada with raw chicken. Guacamole not bad.
115,"Lengua is so so, kinda pricey for one taco. Tamal has good flavors, kinda salty though. The mole has a bit of a kick. The chips and salsa was salty and hard, wish it had other salsa to dip in. Location is in a nice spot, parking and what not. Food comes out super fast."
116,Underwhelming tacos for premium prices.  That might as well be the ad slogan.  Can't say the good was bad (though the chips were hard enough to worry about breaking a tooth).  But I can't say this was rewarding food either.  Just mostly flavorless meh.  Very disappointing.
117,"I was (probably delusional) optimist about this place off the 4th street shopping center for a quick-ish bite to eat. After standing in line for a good long while, we settled on tacos and enchiladas. Food looked good, prices are a bit much for how small the portions are (avoid the non-alcoholic drinks at all cost... they are crazy expensive which we learned the hard way). Waited a while for our food, and man... that was a disappointment. It didn't taste bad. It just tasted meh. The asada is meat, so I supposes it's not false advertising. But if anyone has ever had actually good carna asada... this is no where close. The enchiladas were better than the tacos, but still that's not saying much. We could have gotten the same tastes at an American ""Mexican"" chain restaurant. Won't be back. Bummer."
118,"I went here based on my sister's past visits and I was disappointed!  I decided to try something totally different and I had the sope.  It was awesome - a crispy corn cake with potatoes,  chorizo,  and black beans.  It doesn't look big but it is filling!  Now,  I'm on a, mission to find sopes in my neighborhood but I fear they may not be as good as Tacubayas!  Good job guys and thank you for introducing me to something new.  On a side note,  my sister also recommended the home made churros."

The enchilada sauce was the right consistency, flavorful and not salty. The steak on the taco was grilled and flavorful. I guess you can see that I use the word 'flavorful' three times already! Some places use too much salt to try to enhance the taste of the food, but they did not do that. I would come back in a flash. There's a free public parking lot next to the restaurant and metered parking on the street."
148,"Great casual eatery with tasty offerings. Thursday 7p.m. dinner time with plenty of folks enjoying their meals. Luckily, there was no line at the order counter. My friend suggested tortilla soup and horchata. She also got a torta and a carne asada taco. Nice rich flavored soup. I'll look forward to another visit when I'm hangry. I was still full from the buffet lunch at Galeto Brazilian Steakhouse in Oakland!  Staff were helpful and pleasant."
149,"I've been coming here for a few years, but this is my first time writing a review about this place. I work down the street from here and   a coworker of mine told me about it. The food here is pretty good, everything is made fresh. Especially their tortillas, I love the taste of fresh warm tortillas. It's so soft and delicious.I've gotten the ""papas con crema"" which is basically potato fritters with cheese inside of it and a drizzle of sour cream on top. That one is really good as well. But my most favorite that I always get is either the tuna ceviche or shrimp ceviche with fresh fried tortilla chips. I actually tried their fish tacos for the first time and I thought it was ok. I feel like it needs a little bit more flavor. It was sort of bland. And the aioli sauce didn't have much taste to it neither. I guess I was comparing it to Rubio's.Anyways the ambience is nice and clean. You could also watch them make your food because the kitchen is visible. My only problem with this place is I can never call in my order. I usually come here on my lunch break and it would make it so much better if I can call in my order so I can just be in and out and enjoy my lunch without feeling so rushed. But for some reason they never answer their phones. I understand that they can be busy sometimes but every time I've came on my lunch there's no line and I've asked them why weren't they answering their phones. Sometimes they say that they were  busy and it just died down or one time they didn't even know where the phone was at. It would be nice if I can just call in my order and just pick it up without having to wait. However the food has me coming back for more. I definitely recommend this place."
150,"I hardly write reviews but the service here has been poor consistently and not worth the price you pay.  An attitude of ""There will be someone behind you in line anyways"".  Avoid."
151,"Welp.  When you charge $9 for one Chile relleno, it better be amazing.  Meh food for omg this is life-changing prices loses you a few stars :("
152,"Ate dinner snack here. Chili relleno and chips and salsa. Tasted good. Decor after cinco de mayo. Self seating, order your items, get number, and they bring to your table. Parking on the street after 6pm free else 2 hours limit daytime."
153,"I've always had this love hate relationship with this place. I think it's because Richmond has cheap Mexican eats. This place is seated in the busy 4th Street strip in Berkeley. So I get it, it's shi-shi Mexican food, even though there's nothing in particular that sets it apart from the cheaper places, in my mind, except for location and handmade tortillas all the time. I've had fish tacos here, the crispy pollo tacos, the tortilla soup-- umm didn't like that. And the other day got one sopa de chorizo y papas. That's pretty yummy. I think the sopa shell was a lil crunchy for my liking. I'd rather have it be a lil denser. Also one sopa is $6.95. Yikes!And finally you gotta buy chips and salsa separately. Ya ya fine fine.The food's okay-- it's not spectacular. The line moves fast though, you're not going to wait an hour for a table, like at Bette's down the street."
154,The quality of food was not good. The cashier was very rude. I won't ever go here. Had soft and crispy taco. None was good. Enchilada with raw chicken. Guacamole not bad.
155,"Lengua is so so, kinda pricey for one taco. Tamal has good flavors, kinda salty though. The mole has a bit of a kick. The chips and salsa was salty and hard, wish it had other salsa to dip in. Location is in a nice spot, parking and what not. Food comes out super fast."
156,Underwhelming tacos for premium prices.  That might as well be the ad slogan.  Can't say the good was bad (though the chips were hard enough to worry about breaking a tooth).  But I can't say this was rewarding food either.  Just mostly flavorless meh.  Very disappointing.
157,"I was (probably delusional) optimist about this place off the 4th street shopping center for a quick-ish bite to eat. After standing in line for a good long while, we settled on tacos and enchiladas. Food looked good, prices are a bit much for how small the portions are (avoid the non-alcoholic drinks at all cost... they are crazy expensive which we learned the hard way). Waited a while for our food, and man... that was a disappointment. It didn't taste bad. It just tasted meh. The asada is meat, so I supposes it's not false advertising. But if anyone has ever had actually good carna asada... this is no where close. The enchiladas were better than the tacos, but still that's not saying much. We could have gotten the same tastes at an American ""Mexican"" chain restaurant. Won't be back. Bummer."
158,"I went here based on my sister's past visits and I was disappointed!  I decided to try something totally different and I had the sope.  It was awesome - a crispy corn cake with potatoes,  chorizo,  and black beans.  It doesn't look big but it is filling!  Now,  I'm on a, mission to find sopes in my neighborhood but I fear they may not be as good as Tacubayas!  Good job guys and thank you for introducing me to something new.  On a side note,  my sister also recommended the home made churros."
159,"Love this place. Every time we come here it's delicious. Wonderful service. So authentic. Chilaquiles is one of my favorites, menudo y friholes. Mmm"
160,"Tacubaya is a small Mexican restaurant located in an affluent area of Berkeley. Let me start with that I had a new person help me with the register and he not only forgot to give me utensils, my receipt and my number for the server to know where and who the order went to. But, I'm fair and not going to dock (much) a newbie or the restaurant for a new employee.I got the Torta Vegetariano, which was a vegetarian Torta with no cheese. It had a V next to it for Vegan but had cheese on it so I had to request it to be taken off. If you guys haven't heard I've covered to Vega so I no longer eat meat or fish (I never ate cheese).I also got a strawberry agua fresca and it was amazing! I loved the flavor and how fresh it tasted. I felt that they added sugar to it though, but overall it was delicious.The Torta was amazing, I added hella spice to it, but the bread and the vegetables were grilled to perfection. I definitely recommend stopping by and getting a bite to eat! The food came out quick and it was cheap as well.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me, I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
161,"I loved my vegetarian whole bean taco!! Everything was perfectly fresh. I don't mind paying a bit more for fresh & home made corn tortillas made in front of you while you order... BONUS! It's a perfect place to eat for our little jaunts to Madewell, Lulu & Anthropologie in Berkeley. This is a stand in line , order, get a number & sit down cafe. They were quick & pleasant with their system. Our Modesto stand in line to order & sit w/a number for delivery should take note! My daughter ordered the chicken enchiladas.. they were beautiful and made w/homemade corn tortillas as well. My daughter found a rather large vein googly thing in her chicken and she asked what it was... they immediately offered to remake. Love that! But we were out of time, so we said no. Without even telling us, they took them off our tab and refunded us!! Whoa. Customers matter! They didn't have to do that, after all it was her 2nd enchilada.... def. will be back! And, the homemade quacamole w/ homemade tortilla chips made to order... yummmmy!!! Reminds me of Santa Barbara restaurants. :)"
162,"66% RATIO OF HAIR TO BITES!This place is generally okay.  It's a bit bland for Mexican food, but it's not awful and usually fresh and sanitary.  BUT .... yesterday I ordered a shrimp ceviche special and was about two bites in before my friend noticed a HAIR IN MY FOOD, glimmering in the afternoon sunlight.  Gross!  I looked at the line, and it was super crowded and started thinking ""Hmmm, maybe ONE HAIR won't kill me.""  So, against my better judgment (and in the midst of my friend silently judging my choice) and because I have worked in a restaurant before, I was going to let it go.Until I found a SECOND HAIR!  This hair was NOT lying on top, having blown over by the Berkeley wind.  It was clearly MIXED IN to the food!  So, that's too much, right - three bites and two hairs???  (For those counting, it's 66% of bites with hair.)So, I return it - fine they will take it off my bill.  SO HERE IS THE REALLY TERRIBLE PART - - - BEFORE ORDERING THE CEVICHE, i ASKED IF IT WAS ALREADY MADE, (because I would have liked to omit something), and they said YES, so NOT MADE TO ORDER.  I got it anyway.  The people ordering it after I returned the hairy mess also got it, and the people after them, and so on, and so on, because the kitchen DID NOT THROW IT OUT!Here's an interesting twist - none of the chefs working that day had hair that length so, I think the hair happened in prep, not that it matters but it wasn't the guys there to blame.  Would I like something else?  Again, against my better judgment I ask for a carne asada taco (for which I was charged - no apology taco?)  Anyway, underseasoned, boring asada, but edible and HAIRLESS, so bonus!  Seriously, if y'all ever go to Mexico City - it will kill this place for you.  Not worth the wait, the money, or the effort to locate random hairs.P.S. BUSSING MY OWN TABLE:I also had to go and get a shift towel and wipe down our table before we seated ourselves because the people working there only wipe one table down out of three, and ours was not the lucky winner (apparently hadn't been in several hours, given the dried salsas and such on it.)  So much for the tip I added to my card!"
163,"Stopped by here for a late lunch during the 4th street fair. This is the type of place where you order at the register and give you a number. There is outside and plenty of indoor seating. For food we ordered 2 vegetarian tacos, quesadilla for the lil one and hubby got a spring mixed salad with pepino seeds. Hubby's salad with refreshing, my vegetarian taco with whole pinto beans was good but not worth raving, I could have made something like this at home. If you want chips and salsa, that's extra to buy. I hear the churros here are the bomb, must try next time."
164,"Tacubaya is my fourth street staple and something to always look forward to amid the challenge of looking for a parking spot! Great menu, affordable for the area, and super flavorful food! I did take out and ordered two crispy chicken tacos, one taco al pastor, and a pork tamal. The pastor was not overly greasy, it was crispy yet tender, and was delicious with the fresh tortilla and guacamole! The pork tamal really blew my mind--covered in a dark mole, the masa to pork ratio was perfect, and the pork was very flavorful. Will definitely go back for the tamal! If you are looking for quality Mexican with California freshness, go to Tacubaya! Casual, order at the counter, and good food!!!"
165,"2.5 -but the staff was super nice. Came here for lunch today. The place was hopping with business and there is plenty of room for seating . All staff was friendly, helpful and efficient and the establishment was very clean. We ordered chips and salsa, beef enchiladas and a tostada with sweet potatoes and chicken. The chips were thick and very hard and the salsa was just generic with little to no flavor. The enchilada was better, but again- lacked flavor. Nothing special about it. The tostada was not good and the meat was tough - although it had more flavor than the rest. I don't think I would come here again.  Meh..just OK."

200,"Tacubaya is a small Mexican restaurant located in an affluent area of Berkeley. Let me start with that I had a new person help me with the register and he not only forgot to give me utensils, my receipt and my number for the server to know where and who the order went to. But, I'm fair and not going to dock (much) a newbie or the restaurant for a new employee.I got the Torta Vegetariano, which was a vegetarian Torta with no cheese. It had a V next to it for Vegan but had cheese on it so I had to request it to be taken off. If you guys haven't heard I've covered to Vega so I no longer eat meat or fish (I never ate cheese).I also got a strawberry agua fresca and it was amazing! I loved the flavor and how fresh it tasted. I felt that they added sugar to it though, but overall it was delicious.The Torta was amazing, I added hella spice to it, but the bread and the vegetables were grilled to perfection. I definitely recommend stopping by and getting a bite to eat! The food came out quick and it was cheap as well.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me, I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
201,"I loved my vegetarian whole bean taco!! Everything was perfectly fresh. I don't mind paying a bit more for fresh & home made corn tortillas made in front of you while you order... BONUS! It's a perfect place to eat for our little jaunts to Madewell, Lulu & Anthropologie in Berkeley. This is a stand in line , order, get a number & sit down cafe. They were quick & pleasant with their system. Our Modesto stand in line to order & sit w/a number for delivery should take note! My daughter ordered the chicken enchiladas.. they were beautiful and made w/homemade corn tortillas as well. My daughter found a rather large vein googly thing in her chicken and she asked what it was... they immediately offered to remake. Love that! But we were out of time, so we said no. Without even telling us, they took them off our tab and refunded us!! Whoa. Customers matter! They didn't have to do that, after all it was her 2nd enchilada.... def. will be back! And, the homemade quacamole w/ homemade tortilla chips made to order... yummmmy!!! Reminds me of Santa Barbara restaurants. :)"
202,"66% RATIO OF HAIR TO BITES!This place is generally okay.  It's a bit bland for Mexican food, but it's not awful and usually fresh and sanitary.  BUT .... yesterday I ordered a shrimp ceviche special and was about two bites in before my friend noticed a HAIR IN MY FOOD, glimmering in the afternoon sunlight.  Gross!  I looked at the line, and it was super crowded and started thinking ""Hmmm, maybe ONE HAIR won't kill me.""  So, against my better judgment (and in the midst of my friend silently judging my choice) and because I have worked in a restaurant before, I was going to let it go.Until I found a SECOND HAIR!  This hair was NOT lying on top, having blown over by the Berkeley wind.  It was clearly MIXED IN to the food!  So, that's too much, right - three bites and two hairs???  (For those counting, it's 66% of bites with hair.)So, I return it - fine they will take it off my bill.  SO HERE IS THE REALLY TERRIBLE PART - - - BEFORE ORDERING THE CEVICHE, i ASKED IF IT WAS ALREADY MADE, (because I would have liked to omit something), and they said YES, so NOT MADE TO ORDER.  I got it anyway.  The people ordering it after I returned the hairy mess also got it, and the people after them, and so on, and so on, because the kitchen DID NOT THROW IT OUT!Here's an interesting twist - none of the chefs working that day had hair that length so, I think the hair happened in prep, not that it matters but it wasn't the guys there to blame.  Would I like something else?  Again, against my better judgment I ask for a carne asada taco (for which I was charged - no apology taco?)  Anyway, underseasoned, boring asada, but edible and HAIRLESS, so bonus!  Seriously, if y'all ever go to Mexico City - it will kill this place for you.  Not worth the wait, the money, or the effort to locate random hairs.P.S. BUSSING MY OWN TABLE:I also had to go and get a shift towel and wipe down our table before we seated ourselves because the people working there only wipe one table down out of three, and ours was not the lucky winner (apparently hadn't been in several hours, given the dried salsas and such on it.)  So much for the tip I added to my card!"
203,"Stopped by here for a late lunch during the 4th street fair. This is the type of place where you order at the register and give you a number. There is outside and plenty of indoor seating. For food we ordered 2 vegetarian tacos, quesadilla for the lil one and hubby got a spring mixed salad with pepino seeds. Hubby's salad with refreshing, my vegetarian taco with whole pinto beans was good but not worth raving, I could have made something like this at home. If you want chips and salsa, that's extra to buy. I hear the churros here are the bomb, must try next time."
204,"Tacubaya is my fourth street staple and something to always look forward to amid the challenge of looking for a parking spot! Great menu, affordable for the area, and super flavorful food! I did take out and ordered two crispy chicken tacos, one taco al pastor, and a pork tamal. The pastor was not overly greasy, it was crispy yet tender, and was delicious with the fresh tortilla and guacamole! The pork tamal really blew my mind--covered in a dark mole, the masa to pork ratio was perfect, and the pork was very flavorful. Will definitely go back for the tamal! If you are looking for quality Mexican with California freshness, go to Tacubaya! Casual, order at the counter, and good food!!!"
205,"2.5 -but the staff was super nice. Came here for lunch today. The place was hopping with business and there is plenty of room for seating . All staff was friendly, helpful and efficient and the establishment was very clean. We ordered chips and salsa, beef enchiladas and a tostada with sweet potatoes and chicken. The chips were thick and very hard and the salsa was just generic with little to no flavor. The enchilada was better, but again- lacked flavor. Nothing special about it. The tostada was not good and the meat was tough - although it had more flavor than the rest. I don't think I would come here again.  Meh..just OK."
206,"The battered & fried pollock, fish, $4.15,  and pork, $4 street tacos were delicious, perfectly cooked and served hot. My wife had a delicious made to order Chili Relleno $8.75. expensive but worth it."
207,"This was our first visit  The chicken enchiladas were delicious. The meat was moist, tender and flavorful even without the sauce. The enchilada sauce was the right consistency, flavorful and not salty. The steak on the taco was grilled and flavorful. I guess you can see that I use the word 'flavorful' three times already! Some places use too much salt to try to enhance the taste of the food, but they did not do that. I would come back in a flash. There's a free public parking lot next to the restaurant and metered parking on the street."
208,"Great casual eatery with tasty offerings. Thursday 7p.m. dinner time with plenty of folks enjoying their meals. Luckily, there was no line at the order counter. My friend suggested tortilla soup and horchata. She also got a torta and a carne asada taco. Nice rich flavored soup. I'll look forward to another visit when I'm hangry. I was still full from the buffet lunch at Galeto Brazilian Steakhouse in Oakland!  Staff were helpful and pleasant."
209,"I've been coming here for a few years, but this is my first time writing a review about this place. I work down the street from here and   a coworker of mine told me about it. The food here is pretty good, everything is made fresh. Especially their tortillas, I love the taste of fresh warm tortillas. It's so soft and delicious.I've gotten the ""papas con crema"" which is basically potato fritters with cheese inside of it and a drizzle of sour cream on top. That one is really good as well. But my most favorite that I always get is either the tuna ceviche or shrimp ceviche with fresh fried tortilla chips. I actually tried their fish tacos for the first time and I thought it was ok. I feel like it needs a little bit more flavor. It was sort of bland. And the aioli sauce didn't have much taste to it neither. I guess I was comparing it to Rubio's.Anyways the ambience is nice and clean. You could also watch them make your food because the kitchen is visible. My only problem with this place is I can never call in my order. I usually come here on my lunch break and it would make it so much better if I can call in my order so I can just be in and out and enjoy my lunch without feeling so rushed. But for some reason they never answer their phones. I understand that they can be busy sometimes but every time I've came on my lunch there's no line and I've asked them why weren't they answering their phones. Sometimes they say that they were  busy and it just died down or one time they didn't even know where the phone was at. It would be nice if I can just call in my order and just pick it up without having to wait. However the food has me coming back for more. I definitely recommend this place."
210,"I hardly write reviews but the service here has been poor consistently and not worth the price you pay.  An attitude of ""There will be someone behind you in line anyways"".  Avoid."
211,"Welp.  When you charge $9 for one Chile relleno, it better be amazing.  Meh food for omg this is life-changing prices loses you a few stars :("
212,"Ate dinner snack here. Chili relleno and chips and salsa. Tasted good. Decor after cinco de mayo. Self seating, order your items, get number, and they bring to your table. Parking on the street after 6pm free else 2 hours limit daytime."
213,"I've always had this love hate relationship with this place. I think it's because Richmond has cheap Mexican eats. This place is seated in the busy 4th Street strip in Berkeley. So I get it, it's shi-shi Mexican food, even though there's nothing in particular that sets it apart from the cheaper places, in my mind, except for location and handmade tortillas all the time. I've had fish tacos here, the crispy pollo tacos, the tortilla soup-- umm didn't like that. And the other day got one sopa de chorizo y papas. That's pretty yummy. I think the sopa shell was a lil crunchy for my liking. I'd rather have it be a lil denser. Also one sopa is $6.95. Yikes!And finally you gotta buy chips and salsa separately. Ya ya fine fine.The food's okay-- it's not spectacular. The line moves fast though, you're not going to wait an hour for a table, like at Bette's down the street."
214,The quality of food was not good. The cashier was very rude. I won't ever go here. Had soft and crispy taco. None was good. Enchilada with raw chicken. Guacamole not bad.
215,"Lengua is so so, kinda pricey for one taco. Tamal has good flavors, kinda salty though. The mole has a bit of a kick. The chips and salsa was salty and hard, wish it had other salsa to dip in. Location is in a nice spot, parking and what not. Food comes out super fast."
216,Underwhelming tacos for premium prices.  That might as well be the ad slogan.  Can't say the good was bad (though the chips were hard enough to worry about breaking a tooth).  But I can't say this was rewarding food either.  Just mostly flavorless meh.  Very disappointing.
217,"I was (probably delusional) optimist about this place off the 4th street shopping center for a quick-ish bite to eat. After standing in line for a good long while, we settled on tacos and enchiladas. Food looked good, prices are a bit much for how small the portions are (avoid the non-alcoholic drinks at all cost... they are crazy expensive which we learned the hard way). Waited a while for our food, and man... that was a disappointment. It didn't taste bad. It just tasted meh. The asada is meat, so I supposes it's not false advertising. But if anyone has ever had actually good carna asada... this is no where close. The enchiladas were better than the tacos, but still that's not saying much. We could have gotten the same tastes at an American ""Mexican"" chain restaurant. Won't be back. Bummer."
218,"I went here based on my sister's past visits and I was disappointed!  I decided to try something totally different and I had the sope.  It was awesome - a crispy corn cake with potatoes,  chorizo,  and black beans.  It doesn't look big but it is filling!  Now,  I'm on a, mission to find sopes in my neighborhood but I fear they may not be as good as Tacubayas!  Good job guys and thank you for introducing me to something new.  On a side note,  my sister also recommended the home made churros."

All staff was friendly, helpful and efficient and the establishment was very clean. We ordered chips and salsa, beef enchiladas and a tostada with sweet potatoes and chicken. The chips were thick and very hard and the salsa was just generic with little to no flavor. The enchilada was better, but again- lacked flavor. Nothing special about it. The tostada was not good and the meat was tough - although it had more flavor than the rest. I don't think I would come here again.  Meh..just OK."
246,"The battered & fried pollock, fish, $4.15,  and pork, $4 street tacos were delicious, perfectly cooked and served hot. My wife had a delicious made to order Chili Relleno $8.75. expensive but worth it."
247,"This was our first visit  The chicken enchiladas were delicious. The meat was moist, tender and flavorful even without the sauce. The enchilada sauce was the right consistency, flavorful and not salty. The steak on the taco was grilled and flavorful. I guess you can see that I use the word 'flavorful' three times already! Some places use too much salt to try to enhance the taste of the food, but they did not do that. I would come back in a flash. There's a free public parking lot next to the restaurant and metered parking on the street."
248,"Great casual eatery with tasty offerings. Thursday 7p.m. dinner time with plenty of folks enjoying their meals. Luckily, there was no line at the order counter. My friend suggested tortilla soup and horchata. She also got a torta and a carne asada taco. Nice rich flavored soup. I'll look forward to another visit when I'm hangry. I was still full from the buffet lunch at Galeto Brazilian Steakhouse in Oakland!  Staff were helpful and pleasant."
249,"I've been coming here for a few years, but this is my first time writing a review about this place. I work down the street from here and   a coworker of mine told me about it. The food here is pretty good, everything is made fresh. Especially their tortillas, I love the taste of fresh warm tortillas. It's so soft and delicious.I've gotten the ""papas con crema"" which is basically potato fritters with cheese inside of it and a drizzle of sour cream on top. That one is really good as well. But my most favorite that I always get is either the tuna ceviche or shrimp ceviche with fresh fried tortilla chips. I actually tried their fish tacos for the first time and I thought it was ok. I feel like it needs a little bit more flavor. It was sort of bland. And the aioli sauce didn't have much taste to it neither. I guess I was comparing it to Rubio's.Anyways the ambience is nice and clean. You could also watch them make your food because the kitchen is visible. My only problem with this place is I can never call in my order. I usually come here on my lunch break and it would make it so much better if I can call in my order so I can just be in and out and enjoy my lunch without feeling so rushed. But for some reason they never answer their phones. I understand that they can be busy sometimes but every time I've came on my lunch there's no line and I've asked them why weren't they answering their phones. Sometimes they say that they were  busy and it just died down or one time they didn't even know where the phone was at. It would be nice if I can just call in my order and just pick it up without having to wait. However the food has me coming back for more. I definitely recommend this place."
250,"I hardly write reviews but the service here has been poor consistently and not worth the price you pay.  An attitude of ""There will be someone behind you in line anyways"".  Avoid."
251,"Welp.  When you charge $9 for one Chile relleno, it better be amazing.  Meh food for omg this is life-changing prices loses you a few stars :("
252,"Ate dinner snack here. Chili relleno and chips and salsa. Tasted good. Decor after cinco de mayo. Self seating, order your items, get number, and they bring to your table. Parking on the street after 6pm free else 2 hours limit daytime."
253,"I've always had this love hate relationship with this place. I think it's because Richmond has cheap Mexican eats. This place is seated in the busy 4th Street strip in Berkeley. So I get it, it's shi-shi Mexican food, even though there's nothing in particular that sets it apart from the cheaper places, in my mind, except for location and handmade tortillas all the time. I've had fish tacos here, the crispy pollo tacos, the tortilla soup-- umm didn't like that. And the other day got one sopa de chorizo y papas. That's pretty yummy. I think the sopa shell was a lil crunchy for my liking. I'd rather have it be a lil denser. Also one sopa is $6.95. Yikes!And finally you gotta buy chips and salsa separately. Ya ya fine fine.The food's okay-- it's not spectacular. The line moves fast though, you're not going to wait an hour for a table, like at Bette's down the street."
254,The quality of food was not good. The cashier was very rude. I won't ever go here. Had soft and crispy taco. None was good. Enchilada with raw chicken. Guacamole not bad.
255,"Lengua is so so, kinda pricey for one taco. Tamal has good flavors, kinda salty though. The mole has a bit of a kick. The chips and salsa was salty and hard, wish it had other salsa to dip in. Location is in a nice spot, parking and what not. Food comes out super fast."
256,Underwhelming tacos for premium prices.  That might as well be the ad slogan.  Can't say the good was bad (though the chips were hard enough to worry about breaking a tooth).  But I can't say this was rewarding food either.  Just mostly flavorless meh.  Very disappointing.
257,"I was (probably delusional) optimist about this place off the 4th street shopping center for a quick-ish bite to eat. After standing in line for a good long while, we settled on tacos and enchiladas. Food looked good, prices are a bit much for how small the portions are (avoid the non-alcoholic drinks at all cost... they are crazy expensive which we learned the hard way). Waited a while for our food, and man... that was a disappointment. It didn't taste bad. It just tasted meh. The asada is meat, so I supposes it's not false advertising. But if anyone has ever had actually good carna asada... this is no where close. The enchiladas were better than the tacos, but still that's not saying much. We could have gotten the same tastes at an American ""Mexican"" chain restaurant. Won't be back. Bummer."
258,"I went here based on my sister's past visits and I was disappointed!  I decided to try something totally different and I had the sope.  It was awesome - a crispy corn cake with potatoes,  chorizo,  and black beans.  It doesn't look big but it is filling!  Now,  I'm on a, mission to find sopes in my neighborhood but I fear they may not be as good as Tacubayas!  Good job guys and thank you for introducing me to something new.  On a side note,  my sister also recommended the home made churros."
259,"Love this place. Every time we come here it's delicious. Wonderful service. So authentic. Chilaquiles is one of my favorites, menudo y friholes. Mmm"
260,"Tacubaya is a small Mexican restaurant located in an affluent area of Berkeley. Let me start with that I had a new person help me with the register and he not only forgot to give me utensils, my receipt and my number for the server to know where and who the order went to. But, I'm fair and not going to dock (much) a newbie or the restaurant for a new employee.I got the Torta Vegetariano, which was a vegetarian Torta with no cheese. It had a V next to it for Vegan but had cheese on it so I had to request it to be taken off. If you guys haven't heard I've covered to Vega so I no longer eat meat or fish (I never ate cheese).I also got a strawberry agua fresca and it was amazing! I loved the flavor and how fresh it tasted. I felt that they added sugar to it though, but overall it was delicious.The Torta was amazing, I added hella spice to it, but the bread and the vegetables were grilled to perfection. I definitely recommend stopping by and getting a bite to eat! The food came out quick and it was cheap as well.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me, I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
261,"I loved my vegetarian whole bean taco!! Everything was perfectly fresh. I don't mind paying a bit more for fresh & home made corn tortillas made in front of you while you order... BONUS! It's a perfect place to eat for our little jaunts to Madewell, Lulu & Anthropologie in Berkeley. This is a stand in line , order, get a number & sit down cafe. They were quick & pleasant with their system. Our Modesto stand in line to order & sit w/a number for delivery should take note! My daughter ordered the chicken enchiladas.. they were beautiful and made w/homemade corn tortillas as well. My daughter found a rather large vein googly thing in her chicken and she asked what it was... they immediately offered to remake. Love that! But we were out of time, so we said no. Without even telling us, they took them off our tab and refunded us!! Whoa. Customers matter! They didn't have to do that, after all it was her 2nd enchilada.... def. will be back! And, the homemade quacamole w/ homemade tortilla chips made to order... yummmmy!!! Reminds me of Santa Barbara restaurants. :)"
262,"66% RATIO OF HAIR TO BITES!This place is generally okay.  It's a bit bland for Mexican food, but it's not awful and usually fresh and sanitary.  BUT .... yesterday I ordered a shrimp ceviche special and was about two bites in before my friend noticed a HAIR IN MY FOOD, glimmering in the afternoon sunlight.  Gross!  I looked at the line, and it was super crowded and started thinking ""Hmmm, maybe ONE HAIR won't kill me.""  So, against my better judgment (and in the midst of my friend silently judging my choice) and because I have worked in a restaurant before, I was going to let it go.Until I found a SECOND HAIR!  This hair was NOT lying on top, having blown over by the Berkeley wind.  It was clearly MIXED IN to the food!  So, that's too much, right - three bites and two hairs???  (For those counting, it's 66% of bites with hair.)So, I return it - fine they will take it off my bill.  SO HERE IS THE REALLY TERRIBLE PART - - - BEFORE ORDERING THE CEVICHE, i ASKED IF IT WAS ALREADY MADE, (because I would have liked to omit something), and they said YES, so NOT MADE TO ORDER.  I got it anyway.  The people ordering it after I returned the hairy mess also got it, and the people after them, and so on, and so on, because the kitchen DID NOT THROW IT OUT!Here's an interesting twist - none of the chefs working that day had hair that length so, I think the hair happened in prep, not that it matters but it wasn't the guys there to blame.  Would I like something else?  Again, against my better judgment I ask for a carne asada taco (for which I was charged - no apology taco?)  Anyway, underseasoned, boring asada, but edible and HAIRLESS, so bonus!  Seriously, if y'all ever go to Mexico City - it will kill this place for you.  Not worth the wait, the money, or the effort to locate random hairs.P.S. BUSSING MY OWN TABLE:I also had to go and get a shift towel and wipe down our table before we seated ourselves because the people working there only wipe one table down out of three, and ours was not the lucky winner (apparently hadn't been in several hours, given the dried salsas and such on it.)  So much for the tip I added to my card!"
263,"Stopped by here for a late lunch during the 4th street fair. This is the type of place where you order at the register and give you a number. There is outside and plenty of indoor seating. For food we ordered 2 vegetarian tacos, quesadilla for the lil one and hubby got a spring mixed salad with pepino seeds. Hubby's salad with refreshing, my vegetarian taco with whole pinto beans was good but not worth raving, I could have made something like this at home. If you want chips and salsa, that's extra to buy. I hear the churros here are the bomb, must try next time."
264,"Tacubaya is my fourth street staple and something to always look forward to amid the challenge of looking for a parking spot! Great menu, affordable for the area, and super flavorful food! I did take out and ordered two crispy chicken tacos, one taco al pastor, and a pork tamal. The pastor was not overly greasy, it was crispy yet tender, and was delicious with the fresh tortilla and guacamole! The pork tamal really blew my mind--covered in a dark mole, the masa to pork ratio was perfect, and the pork was very flavorful. Will definitely go back for the tamal! If you are looking for quality Mexican with California freshness, go to Tacubaya! Casual, order at the counter, and good food!!!"

But if anyone has ever had actually good carna asada... this is no where close. The enchiladas were better than the tacos, but still that's not saying much. We could have gotten the same tastes at an American ""Mexican"" chain restaurant. Won't be back. Bummer."
298,"I went here based on my sister's past visits and I was disappointed!  I decided to try something totally different and I had the sope.  It was awesome - a crispy corn cake with potatoes,  chorizo,  and black beans.  It doesn't look big but it is filling!  Now,  I'm on a, mission to find sopes in my neighborhood but I fear they may not be as good as Tacubayas!  Good job guys and thank you for introducing me to something new.  On a side note,  my sister also recommended the home made churros."

300,"Tacubaya is a small Mexican restaurant located in an affluent area of Berkeley. Let me start with that I had a new person help me with the register and he not only forgot to give me utensils, my receipt and my number for the server to know where and who the order went to. But, I'm fair and not going to dock (much) a newbie or the restaurant for a new employee.I got the Torta Vegetariano, which was a vegetarian Torta with no cheese. It had a V next to it for Vegan but had cheese on it so I had to request it to be taken off. If you guys haven't heard I've covered to Vega so I no longer eat meat or fish (I never ate cheese).I also got a strawberry agua fresca and it was amazing! I loved the flavor and how fresh it tasted. I felt that they added sugar to it though, but overall it was delicious.The Torta was amazing, I added hella spice to it, but the bread and the vegetables were grilled to perfection. I definitely recommend stopping by and getting a bite to eat! The food came out quick and it was cheap as well.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me, I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
301,"I loved my vegetarian whole bean taco!! Everything was perfectly fresh. I don't mind paying a bit more for fresh & home made corn tortillas made in front of you while you order... BONUS! It's a perfect place to eat for our little jaunts to Madewell, Lulu & Anthropologie in Berkeley. This is a stand in line , order, get a number & sit down cafe. They were quick & pleasant with their system. Our Modesto stand in line to order & sit w/a number for delivery should take note! My daughter ordered the chicken enchiladas.. they were beautiful and made w/homemade corn tortillas as well. My daughter found a rather large vein googly thing in her chicken and she asked what it was... they immediately offered to remake. Love that! But we were out of time, so we said no. Without even telling us, they took them off our tab and refunded us!! Whoa. Customers matter! They didn't have to do that, after all it was her 2nd enchilada.... def. will be back! And, the homemade quacamole w/ homemade tortilla chips made to order... yummmmy!!! Reminds me of Santa Barbara restaurants. :)"
302,"66% RATIO OF HAIR TO BITES!This place is generally okay.  It's a bit bland for Mexican food, but it's not awful and usually fresh and sanitary.  BUT .... yesterday I ordered a shrimp ceviche special and was about two bites in before my friend noticed a HAIR IN MY FOOD, glimmering in the afternoon sunlight.  Gross!  I looked at the line, and it was super crowded and started thinking ""Hmmm, maybe ONE HAIR won't kill me.""  So, against my better judgment (and in the midst of my friend silently judging my choice) and because I have worked in a restaurant before, I was going to let it go.Until I found a SECOND HAIR!  This hair was NOT lying on top, having blown over by the Berkeley wind.  It was clearly MIXED IN to the food!  So, that's too much, right - three bites and two hairs???  (For those counting, it's 66% of bites with hair.)So, I return it - fine they will take it off my bill.  SO HERE IS THE REALLY TERRIBLE PART - - - BEFORE ORDERING THE CEVICHE, i ASKED IF IT WAS ALREADY MADE, (because I would have liked to omit something), and they said YES, so NOT MADE TO ORDER.  I got it anyway.  The people ordering it after I returned the hairy mess also got it, and the people after them, and so on, and so on, because the kitchen DID NOT THROW IT OUT!Here's an interesting twist - none of the chefs working that day had hair that length so, I think the hair happened in prep, not that it matters but it wasn't the guys there to blame.  Would I like something else?  Again, against my better judgment I ask for a carne asada taco (for which I was charged - no apology taco?)  Anyway, underseasoned, boring asada, but edible and HAIRLESS, so bonus!  Seriously, if y'all ever go to Mexico City - it will kill this place for you.  Not worth the wait, the money, or the effort to locate random hairs.P.S. BUSSING MY OWN TABLE:I also had to go and get a shift towel and wipe down our table before we seated ourselves because the people working there only wipe one table down out of three, and ours was not the lucky winner (apparently hadn't been in several hours, given the dried salsas and such on it.)  So much for the tip I added to my card!"
303,"Stopped by here for a late lunch during the 4th street fair. This is the type of place where you order at the register and give you a number. There is outside and plenty of indoor seating. For food we ordered 2 vegetarian tacos, quesadilla for the lil one and hubby got a spring mixed salad with pepino seeds. Hubby's salad with refreshing, my vegetarian taco with whole pinto beans was good but not worth raving, I could have made something like this at home. If you want chips and salsa, that's extra to buy. I hear the churros here are the bomb, must try next time."
304,"Tacubaya is my fourth street staple and something to always look forward to amid the challenge of looking for a parking spot! Great menu, affordable for the area, and super flavorful food! I did take out and ordered two crispy chicken tacos, one taco al pastor, and a pork tamal. The pastor was not overly greasy, it was crispy yet tender, and was delicious with the fresh tortilla and guacamole! The pork tamal really blew my mind--covered in a dark mole, the masa to pork ratio was perfect, and the pork was very flavorful. Will definitely go back for the tamal! If you are looking for quality Mexican with California freshness, go to Tacubaya! Casual, order at the counter, and good food!!!"
305,"2.5 -but the staff was super nice. Came here for lunch today. The place was hopping with business and there is plenty of room for seating . All staff was friendly, helpful and efficient and the establishment was very clean. We ordered chips and salsa, beef enchiladas and a tostada with sweet potatoes and chicken. The chips were thick and very hard and the salsa was just generic with little to no flavor. The enchilada was better, but again- lacked flavor. Nothing special about it. The tostada was not good and the meat was tough - although it had more flavor than the rest. I don't think I would come here again.  Meh..just OK."
306,"The battered & fried pollock, fish, $4.15,  and pork, $4 street tacos were delicious, perfectly cooked and served hot. My wife had a delicious made to order Chili Relleno $8.75. expensive but worth it."
307,"This was our first visit  The chicken enchiladas were delicious. The meat was moist, tender and flavorful even without the sauce. The enchilada sauce was the right consistency, flavorful and not salty. The steak on the taco was grilled and flavorful. I guess you can see that I use the word 'flavorful' three times already! Some places use too much salt to try to enhance the taste of the food, but they did not do that. I would come back in a flash. There's a free public parking lot next to the restaurant and metered parking on the street."
308,"Great casual eatery with tasty offerings. Thursday 7p.m. dinner time with plenty of folks enjoying their meals. Luckily, there was no line at the order counter. My friend suggested tortilla soup and horchata. She also got a torta and a carne asada taco. Nice rich flavored soup. I'll look forward to another visit when I'm hangry. I was still full from the buffet lunch at Galeto Brazilian Steakhouse in Oakland!  Staff were helpful and pleasant."
309,"I've been coming here for a few years, but this is my first time writing a review about this place. I work down the street from here and   a coworker of mine told me about it. The food here is pretty good, everything is made fresh. Especially their tortillas, I love the taste of fresh warm tortillas. It's so soft and delicious.I've gotten the ""papas con crema"" which is basically potato fritters with cheese inside of it and a drizzle of sour cream on top. That one is really good as well. But my most favorite that I always get is either the tuna ceviche or shrimp ceviche with fresh fried tortilla chips. I actually tried their fish tacos for the first time and I thought it was ok. I feel like it needs a little bit more flavor. It was sort of bland. And the aioli sauce didn't have much taste to it neither. I guess I was comparing it to Rubio's.Anyways the ambience is nice and clean. You could also watch them make your food because the kitchen is visible. My only problem with this place is I can never call in my order. I usually come here on my lunch break and it would make it so much better if I can call in my order so I can just be in and out and enjoy my lunch without feeling so rushed. But for some reason they never answer their phones. I understand that they can be busy sometimes but every time I've came on my lunch there's no line and I've asked them why weren't they answering their phones. Sometimes they say that they were  busy and it just died down or one time they didn't even know where the phone was at. It would be nice if I can just call in my order and just pick it up without having to wait. However the food has me coming back for more. I definitely recommend this place."
310,"I hardly write reviews but the service here has been poor consistently and not worth the price you pay.  An attitude of ""There will be someone behind you in line anyways"".  Avoid."
311,"Welp.  When you charge $9 for one Chile relleno, it better be amazing.  Meh food for omg this is life-changing prices loses you a few stars :("
312,"Ate dinner snack here. Chili relleno and chips and salsa. Tasted good. Decor after cinco de mayo. Self seating, order your items, get number, and they bring to your table. Parking on the street after 6pm free else 2 hours limit daytime."
313,"I've always had this love hate relationship with this place. I think it's because Richmond has cheap Mexican eats. This place is seated in the busy 4th Street strip in Berkeley. So I get it, it's shi-shi Mexican food, even though there's nothing in particular that sets it apart from the cheaper places, in my mind, except for location and handmade tortillas all the time. I've had fish tacos here, the crispy pollo tacos, the tortilla soup-- umm didn't like that. And the other day got one sopa de chorizo y papas. That's pretty yummy. I think the sopa shell was a lil crunchy for my liking. I'd rather have it be a lil denser. Also one sopa is $6.95. Yikes!And finally you gotta buy chips and salsa separately. Ya ya fine fine.The food's okay-- it's not spectacular. The line moves fast though, you're not going to wait an hour for a table, like at Bette's down the street."
314,The quality of food was not good. The cashier was very rude. I won't ever go here. Had soft and crispy taco. None was good. Enchilada with raw chicken. Guacamole not bad.
315,"Lengua is so so, kinda pricey for one taco. Tamal has good flavors, kinda salty though. The mole has a bit of a kick. The chips and salsa was salty and hard, wish it had other salsa to dip in. Location is in a nice spot, parking and what not. Food comes out super fast."
316,Underwhelming tacos for premium prices.  That might as well be the ad slogan.  Can't say the good was bad (though the chips were hard enough to worry about breaking a tooth).  But I can't say this was rewarding food either.  Just mostly flavorless meh.  Very disappointing.
317,"I was (probably delusional) optimist about this place off the 4th street shopping center for a quick-ish bite to eat. After standing in line for a good long while, we settled on tacos and enchiladas. Food looked good, prices are a bit much for how small the portions are (avoid the non-alcoholic drinks at all cost... they are crazy expensive which we learned the hard way). Waited a while for our food, and man... that was a disappointment. It didn't taste bad. It just tasted meh. The asada is meat, so I supposes it's not false advertising.

The pastor was not overly greasy, it was crispy yet tender, and was delicious with the fresh tortilla and guacamole! The pork tamal really blew my mind--covered in a dark mole, the masa to pork ratio was perfect, and the pork was very flavorful. Will definitely go back for the tamal! If you are looking for quality Mexican with California freshness, go to Tacubaya! Casual, order at the counter, and good food!!!"
345,"2.5 -but the staff was super nice. Came here for lunch today. The place was hopping with business and there is plenty of room for seating . All staff was friendly, helpful and efficient and the establishment was very clean. We ordered chips and salsa, beef enchiladas and a tostada with sweet potatoes and chicken. The chips were thick and very hard and the salsa was just generic with little to no flavor. The enchilada was better, but again- lacked flavor. Nothing special about it. The tostada was not good and the meat was tough - although it had more flavor than the rest. I don't think I would come here again.  Meh..just OK."
346,"The battered & fried pollock, fish, $4.15,  and pork, $4 street tacos were delicious, perfectly cooked and served hot. My wife had a delicious made to order Chili Relleno $8.75. expensive but worth it."
347,"This was our first visit  The chicken enchiladas were delicious. The meat was moist, tender and flavorful even without the sauce. The enchilada sauce was the right consistency, flavorful and not salty. The steak on the taco was grilled and flavorful. I guess you can see that I use the word 'flavorful' three times already! Some places use too much salt to try to enhance the taste of the food, but they did not do that. I would come back in a flash. There's a free public parking lot next to the restaurant and metered parking on the street."
348,"Great casual eatery with tasty offerings. Thursday 7p.m. dinner time with plenty of folks enjoying their meals. Luckily, there was no line at the order counter. My friend suggested tortilla soup and horchata. She also got a torta and a carne asada taco. Nice rich flavored soup. I'll look forward to another visit when I'm hangry. I was still full from the buffet lunch at Galeto Brazilian Steakhouse in Oakland!  Staff were helpful and pleasant."
349,"I've been coming here for a few years, but this is my first time writing a review about this place. I work down the street from here and   a coworker of mine told me about it. The food here is pretty good, everything is made fresh. Especially their tortillas, I love the taste of fresh warm tortillas. It's so soft and delicious.I've gotten the ""papas con crema"" which is basically potato fritters with cheese inside of it and a drizzle of sour cream on top. That one is really good as well. But my most favorite that I always get is either the tuna ceviche or shrimp ceviche with fresh fried tortilla chips. I actually tried their fish tacos for the first time and I thought it was ok. I feel like it needs a little bit more flavor. It was sort of bland. And the aioli sauce didn't have much taste to it neither. I guess I was comparing it to Rubio's.Anyways the ambience is nice and clean. You could also watch them make your food because the kitchen is visible. My only problem with this place is I can never call in my order. I usually come here on my lunch break and it would make it so much better if I can call in my order so I can just be in and out and enjoy my lunch without feeling so rushed. But for some reason they never answer their phones. I understand that they can be busy sometimes but every time I've came on my lunch there's no line and I've asked them why weren't they answering their phones. Sometimes they say that they were  busy and it just died down or one time they didn't even know where the phone was at. It would be nice if I can just call in my order and just pick it up without having to wait. However the food has me coming back for more. I definitely recommend this place."
350,"I hardly write reviews but the service here has been poor consistently and not worth the price you pay.  An attitude of ""There will be someone behind you in line anyways"".  Avoid."
351,"Welp.  When you charge $9 for one Chile relleno, it better be amazing.  Meh food for omg this is life-changing prices loses you a few stars :("
352,"Ate dinner snack here. Chili relleno and chips and salsa. Tasted good. Decor after cinco de mayo. Self seating, order your items, get number, and they bring to your table. Parking on the street after 6pm free else 2 hours limit daytime."
353,"I've always had this love hate relationship with this place. I think it's because Richmond has cheap Mexican eats. This place is seated in the busy 4th Street strip in Berkeley. So I get it, it's shi-shi Mexican food, even though there's nothing in particular that sets it apart from the cheaper places, in my mind, except for location and handmade tortillas all the time. I've had fish tacos here, the crispy pollo tacos, the tortilla soup-- umm didn't like that. And the other day got one sopa de chorizo y papas. That's pretty yummy. I think the sopa shell was a lil crunchy for my liking. I'd rather have it be a lil denser. Also one sopa is $6.95. Yikes!And finally you gotta buy chips and salsa separately. Ya ya fine fine.The food's okay-- it's not spectacular. The line moves fast though, you're not going to wait an hour for a table, like at Bette's down the street."
354,The quality of food was not good. The cashier was very rude. I won't ever go here. Had soft and crispy taco. None was good. Enchilada with raw chicken. Guacamole not bad.
355,"Lengua is so so, kinda pricey for one taco. Tamal has good flavors, kinda salty though. The mole has a bit of a kick. The chips and salsa was salty and hard, wish it had other salsa to dip in. Location is in a nice spot, parking and what not. Food comes out super fast."
356,Underwhelming tacos for premium prices.  That might as well be the ad slogan.  Can't say the good was bad (though the chips were hard enough to worry about breaking a tooth).  But I can't say this was rewarding food either.  Just mostly flavorless meh.  Very disappointing.
357,"I was (probably delusional) optimist about this place off the 4th street shopping center for a quick-ish bite to eat. After standing in line for a good long while, we settled on tacos and enchiladas. Food looked good, prices are a bit much for how small the portions are (avoid the non-alcoholic drinks at all cost... they are crazy expensive which we learned the hard way). Waited a while for our food, and man... that was a disappointment. It didn't taste bad. It just tasted meh. The asada is meat, so I supposes it's not false advertising. But if anyone has ever had actually good carna asada... this is no where close. The enchiladas were better than the tacos, but still that's not saying much. We could have gotten the same tastes at an American ""Mexican"" chain restaurant. Won't be back. Bummer."
358,"I went here based on my sister's past visits and I was disappointed!  I decided to try something totally different and I had the sope.  It was awesome - a crispy corn cake with potatoes,  chorizo,  and black beans.  It doesn't look big but it is filling!  Now,  I'm on a, mission to find sopes in my neighborhood but I fear they may not be as good as Tacubayas!  Good job guys and thank you for introducing me to something new.  On a side note,  my sister also recommended the home made churros."
359,"Love this place. Every time we come here it's delicious. Wonderful service. So authentic. Chilaquiles is one of my favorites, menudo y friholes. Mmm"
360,"Tacubaya is a small Mexican restaurant located in an affluent area of Berkeley. Let me start with that I had a new person help me with the register and he not only forgot to give me utensils, my receipt and my number for the server to know where and who the order went to. But, I'm fair and not going to dock (much) a newbie or the restaurant for a new employee.I got the Torta Vegetariano, which was a vegetarian Torta with no cheese. It had a V next to it for Vegan but had cheese on it so I had to request it to be taken off. If you guys haven't heard I've covered to Vega so I no longer eat meat or fish (I never ate cheese).I also got a strawberry agua fresca and it was amazing! I loved the flavor and how fresh it tasted. I felt that they added sugar to it though, but overall it was delicious.The Torta was amazing, I added hella spice to it, but the bread and the vegetables were grilled to perfection. I definitely recommend stopping by and getting a bite to eat! The food came out quick and it was cheap as well.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me, I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
361,"I loved my vegetarian whole bean taco!! Everything was perfectly fresh. I don't mind paying a bit more for fresh & home made corn tortillas made in front of you while you order... BONUS! It's a perfect place to eat for our little jaunts to Madewell, Lulu & Anthropologie in Berkeley. This is a stand in line , order, get a number & sit down cafe. They were quick & pleasant with their system. Our Modesto stand in line to order & sit w/a number for delivery should take note! My daughter ordered the chicken enchiladas.. they were beautiful and made w/homemade corn tortillas as well. My daughter found a rather large vein googly thing in her chicken and she asked what it was... they immediately offered to remake. Love that! But we were out of time, so we said no. Without even telling us, they took them off our tab and refunded us!! Whoa. Customers matter! They didn't have to do that, after all it was her 2nd enchilada.... def. will be back! And, the homemade quacamole w/ homemade tortilla chips made to order... yummmmy!!! Reminds me of Santa Barbara restaurants. :)"
362,"66% RATIO OF HAIR TO BITES!This place is generally okay.  It's a bit bland for Mexican food, but it's not awful and usually fresh and sanitary.  BUT .... yesterday I ordered a shrimp ceviche special and was about two bites in before my friend noticed a HAIR IN MY FOOD, glimmering in the afternoon sunlight.  Gross!  I looked at the line, and it was super crowded and started thinking ""Hmmm, maybe ONE HAIR won't kill me.""  So, against my better judgment (and in the midst of my friend silently judging my choice) and because I have worked in a restaurant before, I was going to let it go.Until I found a SECOND HAIR!  This hair was NOT lying on top, having blown over by the Berkeley wind.  It was clearly MIXED IN to the food!  So, that's too much, right - three bites and two hairs???  (For those counting, it's 66% of bites with hair.)So, I return it - fine they will take it off my bill.  SO HERE IS THE REALLY TERRIBLE PART - - - BEFORE ORDERING THE CEVICHE, i ASKED IF IT WAS ALREADY MADE, (because I would have liked to omit something), and they said YES, so NOT MADE TO ORDER.  I got it anyway.  The people ordering it after I returned the hairy mess also got it, and the people after them, and so on, and so on, because the kitchen DID NOT THROW IT OUT!Here's an interesting twist - none of the chefs working that day had hair that length so, I think the hair happened in prep, not that it matters but it wasn't the guys there to blame.  Would I like something else?  Again, against my better judgment I ask for a carne asada taco (for which I was charged - no apology taco?)  Anyway, underseasoned, boring asada, but edible and HAIRLESS, so bonus!  Seriously, if y'all ever go to Mexico City - it will kill this place for you.  Not worth the wait, the money, or the effort to locate random hairs.P.S. BUSSING MY OWN TABLE:I also had to go and get a shift towel and wipe down our table before we seated ourselves because the people working there only wipe one table down out of three, and ours was not the lucky winner (apparently hadn't been in several hours, given the dried salsas and such on it.)  So much for the tip I added to my card!"
363,"Stopped by here for a late lunch during the 4th street fair. This is the type of place where you order at the register and give you a number. There is outside and plenty of indoor seating. For food we ordered 2 vegetarian tacos, quesadilla for the lil one and hubby got a spring mixed salad with pepino seeds. Hubby's salad with refreshing, my vegetarian taco with whole pinto beans was good but not worth raving, I could have made something like this at home. If you want chips and salsa, that's extra to buy. I hear the churros here are the bomb, must try next time."

After standing in line for a good long while, we settled on tacos and enchiladas. Food looked good, prices are a bit much for how small the portions are (avoid the non-alcoholic drinks at all cost... they are crazy expensive which we learned the hard way). Waited a while for our food, and man... that was a disappointment. It didn't taste bad. It just tasted meh. The asada is meat, so I supposes it's not false advertising. But if anyone has ever had actually good carna asada... this is no where close. The enchiladas were better than the tacos, but still that's not saying much. We could have gotten the same tastes at an American ""Mexican"" chain restaurant. Won't be back. Bummer."
398,"I went here based on my sister's past visits and I was disappointed!  I decided to try something totally different and I had the sope.  It was awesome - a crispy corn cake with potatoes,  chorizo,  and black beans.  It doesn't look big but it is filling!  Now,  I'm on a, mission to find sopes in my neighborhood but I fear they may not be as good as Tacubayas!  Good job guys and thank you for introducing me to something new.  On a side note,  my sister also recommended the home made churros."

400,"Tacubaya is a small Mexican restaurant located in an affluent area of Berkeley. Let me start with that I had a new person help me with the register and he not only forgot to give me utensils, my receipt and my number for the server to know where and who the order went to. But, I'm fair and not going to dock (much) a newbie or the restaurant for a new employee.I got the Torta Vegetariano, which was a vegetarian Torta with no cheese. It had a V next to it for Vegan but had cheese on it so I had to request it to be taken off. If you guys haven't heard I've covered to Vega so I no longer eat meat or fish (I never ate cheese).I also got a strawberry agua fresca and it was amazing! I loved the flavor and how fresh it tasted. I felt that they added sugar to it though, but overall it was delicious.The Torta was amazing, I added hella spice to it, but the bread and the vegetables were grilled to perfection. I definitely recommend stopping by and getting a bite to eat! The food came out quick and it was cheap as well.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me, I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
401,"I loved my vegetarian whole bean taco!! Everything was perfectly fresh. I don't mind paying a bit more for fresh & home made corn tortillas made in front of you while you order... BONUS! It's a perfect place to eat for our little jaunts to Madewell, Lulu & Anthropologie in Berkeley. This is a stand in line , order, get a number & sit down cafe. They were quick & pleasant with their system. Our Modesto stand in line to order & sit w/a number for delivery should take note! My daughter ordered the chicken enchiladas.. they were beautiful and made w/homemade corn tortillas as well. My daughter found a rather large vein googly thing in her chicken and she asked what it was... they immediately offered to remake. Love that! But we were out of time, so we said no. Without even telling us, they took them off our tab and refunded us!! Whoa. Customers matter! They didn't have to do that, after all it was her 2nd enchilada.... def. will be back! And, the homemade quacamole w/ homemade tortilla chips made to order... yummmmy!!! Reminds me of Santa Barbara restaurants. :)"
402,"66% RATIO OF HAIR TO BITES!This place is generally okay.  It's a bit bland for Mexican food, but it's not awful and usually fresh and sanitary.  BUT .... yesterday I ordered a shrimp ceviche special and was about two bites in before my friend noticed a HAIR IN MY FOOD, glimmering in the afternoon sunlight.  Gross!  I looked at the line, and it was super crowded and started thinking ""Hmmm, maybe ONE HAIR won't kill me.""  So, against my better judgment (and in the midst of my friend silently judging my choice) and because I have worked in a restaurant before, I was going to let it go.Until I found a SECOND HAIR!  This hair was NOT lying on top, having blown over by the Berkeley wind.  It was clearly MIXED IN to the food!  So, that's too much, right - three bites and two hairs???  (For those counting, it's 66% of bites with hair.)So, I return it - fine they will take it off my bill.  SO HERE IS THE REALLY TERRIBLE PART - - - BEFORE ORDERING THE CEVICHE, i ASKED IF IT WAS ALREADY MADE, (because I would have liked to omit something), and they said YES, so NOT MADE TO ORDER.  I got it anyway.  The people ordering it after I returned the hairy mess also got it, and the people after them, and so on, and so on, because the kitchen DID NOT THROW IT OUT!Here's an interesting twist - none of the chefs working that day had hair that length so, I think the hair happened in prep, not that it matters but it wasn't the guys there to blame.  Would I like something else?  Again, against my better judgment I ask for a carne asada taco (for which I was charged - no apology taco?)  Anyway, underseasoned, boring asada, but edible and HAIRLESS, so bonus!  Seriously, if y'all ever go to Mexico City - it will kill this place for you.  Not worth the wait, the money, or the effort to locate random hairs.P.S. BUSSING MY OWN TABLE:I also had to go and get a shift towel and wipe down our table before we seated ourselves because the people working there only wipe one table down out of three, and ours was not the lucky winner (apparently hadn't been in several hours, given the dried salsas and such on it.)  So much for the tip I added to my card!"
403,"Stopped by here for a late lunch during the 4th street fair. This is the type of place where you order at the register and give you a number. There is outside and plenty of indoor seating. For food we ordered 2 vegetarian tacos, quesadilla for the lil one and hubby got a spring mixed salad with pepino seeds. Hubby's salad with refreshing, my vegetarian taco with whole pinto beans was good but not worth raving, I could have made something like this at home. If you want chips and salsa, that's extra to buy. I hear the churros here are the bomb, must try next time."
404,"Tacubaya is my fourth street staple and something to always look forward to amid the challenge of looking for a parking spot! Great menu, affordable for the area, and super flavorful food! I did take out and ordered two crispy chicken tacos, one taco al pastor, and a pork tamal. The pastor was not overly greasy, it was crispy yet tender, and was delicious with the fresh tortilla and guacamole! The pork tamal really blew my mind--covered in a dark mole, the masa to pork ratio was perfect, and the pork was very flavorful. Will definitely go back for the tamal! If you are looking for quality Mexican with California freshness, go to Tacubaya! Casual, order at the counter, and good food!!!"
405,"2.5 -but the staff was super nice. Came here for lunch today. The place was hopping with business and there is plenty of room for seating . All staff was friendly, helpful and efficient and the establishment was very clean. We ordered chips and salsa, beef enchiladas and a tostada with sweet potatoes and chicken. The chips were thick and very hard and the salsa was just generic with little to no flavor. The enchilada was better, but again- lacked flavor. Nothing special about it. The tostada was not good and the meat was tough - although it had more flavor than the rest. I don't think I would come here again.  Meh..just OK."
406,"The battered & fried pollock, fish, $4.15,  and pork, $4 street tacos were delicious, perfectly cooked and served hot. My wife had a delicious made to order Chili Relleno $8.75. expensive but worth it."
407,"This was our first visit  The chicken enchiladas were delicious. The meat was moist, tender and flavorful even without the sauce. The enchilada sauce was the right consistency, flavorful and not salty. The steak on the taco was grilled and flavorful. I guess you can see that I use the word 'flavorful' three times already! Some places use too much salt to try to enhance the taste of the food, but they did not do that. I would come back in a flash. There's a free public parking lot next to the restaurant and metered parking on the street."
408,"Great casual eatery with tasty offerings. Thursday 7p.m. dinner time with plenty of folks enjoying their meals. Luckily, there was no line at the order counter. My friend suggested tortilla soup and horchata. She also got a torta and a carne asada taco. Nice rich flavored soup. I'll look forward to another visit when I'm hangry. I was still full from the buffet lunch at Galeto Brazilian Steakhouse in Oakland!  Staff were helpful and pleasant."
409,"I've been coming here for a few years, but this is my first time writing a review about this place. I work down the street from here and   a coworker of mine told me about it. The food here is pretty good, everything is made fresh. Especially their tortillas, I love the taste of fresh warm tortillas. It's so soft and delicious.I've gotten the ""papas con crema"" which is basically potato fritters with cheese inside of it and a drizzle of sour cream on top. That one is really good as well. But my most favorite that I always get is either the tuna ceviche or shrimp ceviche with fresh fried tortilla chips. I actually tried their fish tacos for the first time and I thought it was ok. I feel like it needs a little bit more flavor. It was sort of bland. And the aioli sauce didn't have much taste to it neither. I guess I was comparing it to Rubio's.Anyways the ambience is nice and clean. You could also watch them make your food because the kitchen is visible. My only problem with this place is I can never call in my order. I usually come here on my lunch break and it would make it so much better if I can call in my order so I can just be in and out and enjoy my lunch without feeling so rushed. But for some reason they never answer their phones. I understand that they can be busy sometimes but every time I've came on my lunch there's no line and I've asked them why weren't they answering their phones. Sometimes they say that they were  busy and it just died down or one time they didn't even know where the phone was at. It would be nice if I can just call in my order and just pick it up without having to wait. However the food has me coming back for more. I definitely recommend this place."
410,"I hardly write reviews but the service here has been poor consistently and not worth the price you pay.  An attitude of ""There will be someone behind you in line anyways"".  Avoid."
411,"Welp.  When you charge $9 for one Chile relleno, it better be amazing.  Meh food for omg this is life-changing prices loses you a few stars :("
412,"Ate dinner snack here. Chili relleno and chips and salsa. Tasted good. Decor after cinco de mayo. Self seating, order your items, get number, and they bring to your table. Parking on the street after 6pm free else 2 hours limit daytime."
413,"I've always had this love hate relationship with this place. I think it's because Richmond has cheap Mexican eats. This place is seated in the busy 4th Street strip in Berkeley. So I get it, it's shi-shi Mexican food, even though there's nothing in particular that sets it apart from the cheaper places, in my mind, except for location and handmade tortillas all the time. I've had fish tacos here, the crispy pollo tacos, the tortilla soup-- umm didn't like that. And the other day got one sopa de chorizo y papas. That's pretty yummy. I think the sopa shell was a lil crunchy for my liking. I'd rather have it be a lil denser. Also one sopa is $6.95. Yikes!And finally you gotta buy chips and salsa separately. Ya ya fine fine.The food's okay-- it's not spectacular. The line moves fast though, you're not going to wait an hour for a table, like at Bette's down the street."
414,The quality of food was not good. The cashier was very rude. I won't ever go here. Had soft and crispy taco. None was good. Enchilada with raw chicken. Guacamole not bad.
415,"Lengua is so so, kinda pricey for one taco. Tamal has good flavors, kinda salty though. The mole has a bit of a kick. The chips and salsa was salty and hard, wish it had other salsa to dip in. Location is in a nice spot, parking and what not. Food comes out super fast."
416,Underwhelming tacos for premium prices.  That might as well be the ad slogan.  Can't say the good was bad (though the chips were hard enough to worry about breaking a tooth).  But I can't say this was rewarding food either.  Just mostly flavorless meh.  Very disappointing.

Hubby's salad with refreshing, my vegetarian taco with whole pinto beans was good but not worth raving, I could have made something like this at home. If you want chips and salsa, that's extra to buy. I hear the churros here are the bomb, must try next time."
444,"Tacubaya is my fourth street staple and something to always look forward to amid the challenge of looking for a parking spot! Great menu, affordable for the area, and super flavorful food! I did take out and ordered two crispy chicken tacos, one taco al pastor, and a pork tamal. The pastor was not overly greasy, it was crispy yet tender, and was delicious with the fresh tortilla and guacamole! The pork tamal really blew my mind--covered in a dark mole, the masa to pork ratio was perfect, and the pork was very flavorful. Will definitely go back for the tamal! If you are looking for quality Mexican with California freshness, go to Tacubaya! Casual, order at the counter, and good food!!!"
445,"2.5 -but the staff was super nice. Came here for lunch today. The place was hopping with business and there is plenty of room for seating . All staff was friendly, helpful and efficient and the establishment was very clean. We ordered chips and salsa, beef enchiladas and a tostada with sweet potatoes and chicken. The chips were thick and very hard and the salsa was just generic with little to no flavor. The enchilada was better, but again- lacked flavor. Nothing special about it. The tostada was not good and the meat was tough - although it had more flavor than the rest. I don't think I would come here again.  Meh..just OK."
446,"The battered & fried pollock, fish, $4.15,  and pork, $4 street tacos were delicious, perfectly cooked and served hot. My wife had a delicious made to order Chili Relleno $8.75. expensive but worth it."
447,"This was our first visit  The chicken enchiladas were delicious. The meat was moist, tender and flavorful even without the sauce. The enchilada sauce was the right consistency, flavorful and not salty. The steak on the taco was grilled and flavorful. I guess you can see that I use the word 'flavorful' three times already! Some places use too much salt to try to enhance the taste of the food, but they did not do that. I would come back in a flash. There's a free public parking lot next to the restaurant and metered parking on the street."
448,"Great casual eatery with tasty offerings. Thursday 7p.m. dinner time with plenty of folks enjoying their meals. Luckily, there was no line at the order counter. My friend suggested tortilla soup and horchata. She also got a torta and a carne asada taco. Nice rich flavored soup. I'll look forward to another visit when I'm hangry. I was still full from the buffet lunch at Galeto Brazilian Steakhouse in Oakland!  Staff were helpful and pleasant."
449,"I've been coming here for a few years, but this is my first time writing a review about this place. I work down the street from here and   a coworker of mine told me about it. The food here is pretty good, everything is made fresh. Especially their tortillas, I love the taste of fresh warm tortillas. It's so soft and delicious.I've gotten the ""papas con crema"" which is basically potato fritters with cheese inside of it and a drizzle of sour cream on top. That one is really good as well. But my most favorite that I always get is either the tuna ceviche or shrimp ceviche with fresh fried tortilla chips. I actually tried their fish tacos for the first time and I thought it was ok. I feel like it needs a little bit more flavor. It was sort of bland. And the aioli sauce didn't have much taste to it neither. I guess I was comparing it to Rubio's.Anyways the ambience is nice and clean. You could also watch them make your food because the kitchen is visible. My only problem with this place is I can never call in my order. I usually come here on my lunch break and it would make it so much better if I can call in my order so I can just be in and out and enjoy my lunch without feeling so rushed. But for some reason they never answer their phones. I understand that they can be busy sometimes but every time I've came on my lunch there's no line and I've asked them why weren't they answering their phones. Sometimes they say that they were  busy and it just died down or one time they didn't even know where the phone was at. It would be nice if I can just call in my order and just pick it up without having to wait. However the food has me coming back for more. I definitely recommend this place."
450,"I hardly write reviews but the service here has been poor consistently and not worth the price you pay.  An attitude of ""There will be someone behind you in line anyways"".  Avoid."
451,"Welp.  When you charge $9 for one Chile relleno, it better be amazing.  Meh food for omg this is life-changing prices loses you a few stars :("
452,"Ate dinner snack here. Chili relleno and chips and salsa. Tasted good. Decor after cinco de mayo. Self seating, order your items, get number, and they bring to your table. Parking on the street after 6pm free else 2 hours limit daytime."
453,"I've always had this love hate relationship with this place. I think it's because Richmond has cheap Mexican eats. This place is seated in the busy 4th Street strip in Berkeley. So I get it, it's shi-shi Mexican food, even though there's nothing in particular that sets it apart from the cheaper places, in my mind, except for location and handmade tortillas all the time. I've had fish tacos here, the crispy pollo tacos, the tortilla soup-- umm didn't like that. And the other day got one sopa de chorizo y papas. That's pretty yummy. I think the sopa shell was a lil crunchy for my liking. I'd rather have it be a lil denser. Also one sopa is $6.95. Yikes!And finally you gotta buy chips and salsa separately. Ya ya fine fine.The food's okay-- it's not spectacular. The line moves fast though, you're not going to wait an hour for a table, like at Bette's down the street."
454,The quality of food was not good. The cashier was very rude. I won't ever go here. Had soft and crispy taco. None was good. Enchilada with raw chicken. Guacamole not bad.
455,"Lengua is so so, kinda pricey for one taco. Tamal has good flavors, kinda salty though. The mole has a bit of a kick. The chips and salsa was salty and hard, wish it had other salsa to dip in. Location is in a nice spot, parking and what not. Food comes out super fast."
456,Underwhelming tacos for premium prices.  That might as well be the ad slogan.  Can't say the good was bad (though the chips were hard enough to worry about breaking a tooth).  But I can't say this was rewarding food either.  Just mostly flavorless meh.  Very disappointing.
457,"I was (probably delusional) optimist about this place off the 4th street shopping center for a quick-ish bite to eat. After standing in line for a good long while, we settled on tacos and enchiladas. Food looked good, prices are a bit much for how small the portions are (avoid the non-alcoholic drinks at all cost... they are crazy expensive which we learned the hard way). Waited a while for our food, and man... that was a disappointment. It didn't taste bad. It just tasted meh. The asada is meat, so I supposes it's not false advertising. But if anyone has ever had actually good carna asada... this is no where close. The enchiladas were better than the tacos, but still that's not saying much. We could have gotten the same tastes at an American ""Mexican"" chain restaurant. Won't be back. Bummer."
458,"I went here based on my sister's past visits and I was disappointed!  I decided to try something totally different and I had the sope.  It was awesome - a crispy corn cake with potatoes,  chorizo,  and black beans.  It doesn't look big but it is filling!  Now,  I'm on a, mission to find sopes in my neighborhood but I fear they may not be as good as Tacubayas!  Good job guys and thank you for introducing me to something new.  On a side note,  my sister also recommended the home made churros."
459,"Love this place. Every time we come here it's delicious. Wonderful service. So authentic. Chilaquiles is one of my favorites, menudo y friholes. Mmm"
460,"Tacubaya is a small Mexican restaurant located in an affluent area of Berkeley. Let me start with that I had a new person help me with the register and he not only forgot to give me utensils, my receipt and my number for the server to know where and who the order went to. But, I'm fair and not going to dock (much) a newbie or the restaurant for a new employee.I got the Torta Vegetariano, which was a vegetarian Torta with no cheese. It had a V next to it for Vegan but had cheese on it so I had to request it to be taken off. If you guys haven't heard I've covered to Vega so I no longer eat meat or fish (I never ate cheese).I also got a strawberry agua fresca and it was amazing! I loved the flavor and how fresh it tasted. I felt that they added sugar to it though, but overall it was delicious.The Torta was amazing, I added hella spice to it, but the bread and the vegetables were grilled to perfection. I definitely recommend stopping by and getting a bite to eat! The food came out quick and it was cheap as well.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me, I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
461,"I loved my vegetarian whole bean taco!! Everything was perfectly fresh. I don't mind paying a bit more for fresh & home made corn tortillas made in front of you while you order... BONUS! It's a perfect place to eat for our little jaunts to Madewell, Lulu & Anthropologie in Berkeley. This is a stand in line , order, get a number & sit down cafe. They were quick & pleasant with their system. Our Modesto stand in line to order & sit w/a number for delivery should take note! My daughter ordered the chicken enchiladas.. they were beautiful and made w/homemade corn tortillas as well. My daughter found a rather large vein googly thing in her chicken and she asked what it was... they immediately offered to remake. Love that! But we were out of time, so we said no. Without even telling us, they took them off our tab and refunded us!! Whoa. Customers matter! They didn't have to do that, after all it was her 2nd enchilada.... def. will be back! And, the homemade quacamole w/ homemade tortilla chips made to order... yummmmy!!! Reminds me of Santa Barbara restaurants. :)"
462,"66% RATIO OF HAIR TO BITES!This place is generally okay.  It's a bit bland for Mexican food, but it's not awful and usually fresh and sanitary.  BUT .... yesterday I ordered a shrimp ceviche special and was about two bites in before my friend noticed a HAIR IN MY FOOD, glimmering in the afternoon sunlight.  Gross!  I looked at the line, and it was super crowded and started thinking ""Hmmm, maybe ONE HAIR won't kill me.""  So, against my better judgment (and in the midst of my friend silently judging my choice) and because I have worked in a restaurant before, I was going to let it go.Until I found a SECOND HAIR!  This hair was NOT lying on top, having blown over by the Berkeley wind.  It was clearly MIXED IN to the food!  So, that's too much, right - three bites and two hairs???  (For those counting, it's 66% of bites with hair.)So, I return it - fine they will take it off my bill.  SO HERE IS THE REALLY TERRIBLE PART - - - BEFORE ORDERING THE CEVICHE, i ASKED IF IT WAS ALREADY MADE, (because I would have liked to omit something), and they said YES, so NOT MADE TO ORDER.  I got it anyway.  The people ordering it after I returned the hairy mess also got it, and the people after them, and so on, and so on, because the kitchen DID NOT THROW IT OUT!Here's an interesting twist - none of the chefs working that day had hair that length so, I think the hair happened in prep, not that it matters but it wasn't the guys there to blame.  Would I like something else?  Again, against my better judgment I ask for a carne asada taco (for which I was charged - no apology taco?)  Anyway, underseasoned, boring asada, but edible and HAIRLESS, so bonus!  Seriously, if y'all ever go to Mexico City - it will kill this place for you.  Not worth the wait, the money, or the effort to locate random hairs.P.S. BUSSING MY OWN TABLE:I also had to go and get a shift towel and wipe down our table before we seated ourselves because the people working there only wipe one table down out of three, and ours was not the lucky winner (apparently hadn't been in several hours, given the dried salsas and such on it.)  So much for the tip I added to my card!"

495,"Lengua is so so, kinda pricey for one taco. Tamal has good flavors, kinda salty though. The mole has a bit of a kick. The chips and salsa was salty and hard, wish it had other salsa to dip in. Location is in a nice spot, parking and what not. Food comes out super fast."
496,Underwhelming tacos for premium prices.  That might as well be the ad slogan.  Can't say the good was bad (though the chips were hard enough to worry about breaking a tooth).  But I can't say this was rewarding food either.  Just mostly flavorless meh.  Very disappointing.
497,"I was (probably delusional) optimist about this place off the 4th street shopping center for a quick-ish bite to eat. After standing in line for a good long while, we settled on tacos and enchiladas. Food looked good, prices are a bit much for how small the portions are (avoid the non-alcoholic drinks at all cost... they are crazy expensive which we learned the hard way). Waited a while for our food, and man... that was a disappointment. It didn't taste bad. It just tasted meh. The asada is meat, so I supposes it's not false advertising. But if anyone has ever had actually good carna asada... this is no where close. The enchiladas were better than the tacos, but still that's not saying much. We could have gotten the same tastes at an American ""Mexican"" chain restaurant. Won't be back. Bummer."
498,"I went here based on my sister's past visits and I was disappointed!  I decided to try something totally different and I had the sope.  It was awesome - a crispy corn cake with potatoes,  chorizo,  and black beans.  It doesn't look big but it is filling!  Now,  I'm on a, mission to find sopes in my neighborhood but I fear they may not be as good as Tacubayas!  Good job guys and thank you for introducing me to something new.  On a side note,  my sister also recommended the home made churros."

500,"Tacubaya is a small Mexican restaurant located in an affluent area of Berkeley. Let me start with that I had a new person help me with the register and he not only forgot to give me utensils, my receipt and my number for the server to know where and who the order went to. But, I'm fair and not going to dock (much) a newbie or the restaurant for a new employee.I got the Torta Vegetariano, which was a vegetarian Torta with no cheese. It had a V next to it for Vegan but had cheese on it so I had to request it to be taken off. If you guys haven't heard I've covered to Vega so I no longer eat meat or fish (I never ate cheese).I also got a strawberry agua fresca and it was amazing! I loved the flavor and how fresh it tasted. I felt that they added sugar to it though, but overall it was delicious.The Torta was amazing, I added hella spice to it, but the bread and the vegetables were grilled to perfection. I definitely recommend stopping by and getting a bite to eat! The food came out quick and it was cheap as well.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me, I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
501,"I loved my vegetarian whole bean taco!! Everything was perfectly fresh. I don't mind paying a bit more for fresh & home made corn tortillas made in front of you while you order... BONUS! It's a perfect place to eat for our little jaunts to Madewell, Lulu & Anthropologie in Berkeley. This is a stand in line , order, get a number & sit down cafe. They were quick & pleasant with their system. Our Modesto stand in line to order & sit w/a number for delivery should take note! My daughter ordered the chicken enchiladas.. they were beautiful and made w/homemade corn tortillas as well. My daughter found a rather large vein googly thing in her chicken and she asked what it was... they immediately offered to remake. Love that! But we were out of time, so we said no. Without even telling us, they took them off our tab and refunded us!! Whoa. Customers matter! They didn't have to do that, after all it was her 2nd enchilada.... def. will be back! And, the homemade quacamole w/ homemade tortilla chips made to order... yummmmy!!! Reminds me of Santa Barbara restaurants. :)"
502,"66% RATIO OF HAIR TO BITES!This place is generally okay.  It's a bit bland for Mexican food, but it's not awful and usually fresh and sanitary.  BUT .... yesterday I ordered a shrimp ceviche special and was about two bites in before my friend noticed a HAIR IN MY FOOD, glimmering in the afternoon sunlight.  Gross!  I looked at the line, and it was super crowded and started thinking ""Hmmm, maybe ONE HAIR won't kill me.""  So, against my better judgment (and in the midst of my friend silently judging my choice) and because I have worked in a restaurant before, I was going to let it go.Until I found a SECOND HAIR!  This hair was NOT lying on top, having blown over by the Berkeley wind.  It was clearly MIXED IN to the food!  So, that's too much, right - three bites and two hairs???  (For those counting, it's 66% of bites with hair.)So, I return it - fine they will take it off my bill.  SO HERE IS THE REALLY TERRIBLE PART - - - BEFORE ORDERING THE CEVICHE, i ASKED IF IT WAS ALREADY MADE, (because I would have liked to omit something), and they said YES, so NOT MADE TO ORDER.  I got it anyway.  The people ordering it after I returned the hairy mess also got it, and the people after them, and so on, and so on, because the kitchen DID NOT THROW IT OUT!Here's an interesting twist - none of the chefs working that day had hair that length so, I think the hair happened in prep, not that it matters but it wasn't the guys there to blame.  Would I like something else?  Again, against my better judgment I ask for a carne asada taco (for which I was charged - no apology taco?)  Anyway, underseasoned, boring asada, but edible and HAIRLESS, so bonus!  Seriously, if y'all ever go to Mexico City - it will kill this place for you.  Not worth the wait, the money, or the effort to locate random hairs.P.S. BUSSING MY OWN TABLE:I also had to go and get a shift towel and wipe down our table before we seated ourselves because the people working there only wipe one table down out of three, and ours was not the lucky winner (apparently hadn't been in several hours, given the dried salsas and such on it.)  So much for the tip I added to my card!"
503,"Stopped by here for a late lunch during the 4th street fair. This is the type of place where you order at the register and give you a number. There is outside and plenty of indoor seating. For food we ordered 2 vegetarian tacos, quesadilla for the lil one and hubby got a spring mixed salad with pepino seeds. Hubby's salad with refreshing, my vegetarian taco with whole pinto beans was good but not worth raving, I could have made something like this at home. If you want chips and salsa, that's extra to buy. I hear the churros here are the bomb, must try next time."
504,"Tacubaya is my fourth street staple and something to always look forward to amid the challenge of looking for a parking spot! Great menu, affordable for the area, and super flavorful food! I did take out and ordered two crispy chicken tacos, one taco al pastor, and a pork tamal. The pastor was not overly greasy, it was crispy yet tender, and was delicious with the fresh tortilla and guacamole! The pork tamal really blew my mind--covered in a dark mole, the masa to pork ratio was perfect, and the pork was very flavorful. Will definitely go back for the tamal! If you are looking for quality Mexican with California freshness, go to Tacubaya! Casual, order at the counter, and good food!!!"
505,"2.5 -but the staff was super nice. Came here for lunch today. The place was hopping with business and there is plenty of room for seating . All staff was friendly, helpful and efficient and the establishment was very clean. We ordered chips and salsa, beef enchiladas and a tostada with sweet potatoes and chicken. The chips were thick and very hard and the salsa was just generic with little to no flavor. The enchilada was better, but again- lacked flavor. Nothing special about it. The tostada was not good and the meat was tough - although it had more flavor than the rest. I don't think I would come here again.  Meh..just OK."
506,"The battered & fried pollock, fish, $4.15,  and pork, $4 street tacos were delicious, perfectly cooked and served hot. My wife had a delicious made to order Chili Relleno $8.75. expensive but worth it."
507,"This was our first visit  The chicken enchiladas were delicious. The meat was moist, tender and flavorful even without the sauce. The enchilada sauce was the right consistency, flavorful and not salty. The steak on the taco was grilled and flavorful. I guess you can see that I use the word 'flavorful' three times already! Some places use too much salt to try to enhance the taste of the food, but they did not do that. I would come back in a flash. There's a free public parking lot next to the restaurant and metered parking on the street."
508,"Great casual eatery with tasty offerings. Thursday 7p.m. dinner time with plenty of folks enjoying their meals. Luckily, there was no line at the order counter. My friend suggested tortilla soup and horchata. She also got a torta and a carne asada taco. Nice rich flavored soup. I'll look forward to another visit when I'm hangry. I was still full from the buffet lunch at Galeto Brazilian Steakhouse in Oakland!  Staff were helpful and pleasant."
509,"I've been coming here for a few years, but this is my first time writing a review about this place. I work down the street from here and   a coworker of mine told me about it. The food here is pretty good, everything is made fresh. Especially their tortillas, I love the taste of fresh warm tortillas. It's so soft and delicious.I've gotten the ""papas con crema"" which is basically potato fritters with cheese inside of it and a drizzle of sour cream on top. That one is really good as well. But my most favorite that I always get is either the tuna ceviche or shrimp ceviche with fresh fried tortilla chips. I actually tried their fish tacos for the first time and I thought it was ok. I feel like it needs a little bit more flavor. It was sort of bland. And the aioli sauce didn't have much taste to it neither. I guess I was comparing it to Rubio's.Anyways the ambience is nice and clean. You could also watch them make your food because the kitchen is visible. My only problem with this place is I can never call in my order. I usually come here on my lunch break and it would make it so much better if I can call in my order so I can just be in and out and enjoy my lunch without feeling so rushed. But for some reason they never answer their phones. I understand that they can be busy sometimes but every time I've came on my lunch there's no line and I've asked them why weren't they answering their phones. Sometimes they say that they were  busy and it just died down or one time they didn't even know where the phone was at. It would be nice if I can just call in my order and just pick it up without having to wait. However the food has me coming back for more. I definitely recommend this place."
510,"I hardly write reviews but the service here has been poor consistently and not worth the price you pay.  An attitude of ""There will be someone behind you in line anyways"".  Avoid."
511,"Welp.  When you charge $9 for one Chile relleno, it better be amazing.  Meh food for omg this is life-changing prices loses you a few stars :("
512,"Ate dinner snack here. Chili relleno and chips and salsa. Tasted good. Decor after cinco de mayo. Self seating, order your items, get number, and they bring to your table. Parking on the street after 6pm free else 2 hours limit daytime."
513,"I've always had this love hate relationship with this place. I think it's because Richmond has cheap Mexican eats. This place is seated in the busy 4th Street strip in Berkeley. So I get it, it's shi-shi Mexican food, even though there's nothing in particular that sets it apart from the cheaper places, in my mind, except for location and handmade tortillas all the time. I've had fish tacos here, the crispy pollo tacos, the tortilla soup-- umm didn't like that. And the other day got one sopa de chorizo y papas. That's pretty yummy. I think the sopa shell was a lil crunchy for my liking. I'd rather have it be a lil denser. Also one sopa is $6.95. Yikes!And finally you gotta buy chips and salsa separately. Ya ya fine fine.The food's okay-- it's not spectacular. The line moves fast though, you're not going to wait an hour for a table, like at Bette's down the street."

BUSSING MY OWN TABLE:I also had to go and get a shift towel and wipe down our table before we seated ourselves because the people working there only wipe one table down out of three, and ours was not the lucky winner (apparently hadn't been in several hours, given the dried salsas and such on it.)  So much for the tip I added to my card!"
543,"Stopped by here for a late lunch during the 4th street fair. This is the type of place where you order at the register and give you a number. There is outside and plenty of indoor seating. For food we ordered 2 vegetarian tacos, quesadilla for the lil one and hubby got a spring mixed salad with pepino seeds. Hubby's salad with refreshing, my vegetarian taco with whole pinto beans was good but not worth raving, I could have made something like this at home. If you want chips and salsa, that's extra to buy. I hear the churros here are the bomb, must try next time."
544,"Tacubaya is my fourth street staple and something to always look forward to amid the challenge of looking for a parking spot! Great menu, affordable for the area, and super flavorful food! I did take out and ordered two crispy chicken tacos, one taco al pastor, and a pork tamal. The pastor was not overly greasy, it was crispy yet tender, and was delicious with the fresh tortilla and guacamole! The pork tamal really blew my mind--covered in a dark mole, the masa to pork ratio was perfect, and the pork was very flavorful. Will definitely go back for the tamal! If you are looking for quality Mexican with California freshness, go to Tacubaya! Casual, order at the counter, and good food!!!"
545,"2.5 -but the staff was super nice. Came here for lunch today. The place was hopping with business and there is plenty of room for seating . All staff was friendly, helpful and efficient and the establishment was very clean. We ordered chips and salsa, beef enchiladas and a tostada with sweet potatoes and chicken. The chips were thick and very hard and the salsa was just generic with little to no flavor. The enchilada was better, but again- lacked flavor. Nothing special about it. The tostada was not good and the meat was tough - although it had more flavor than the rest. I don't think I would come here again.  Meh..just OK."
546,"The battered & fried pollock, fish, $4.15,  and pork, $4 street tacos were delicious, perfectly cooked and served hot. My wife had a delicious made to order Chili Relleno $8.75. expensive but worth it."
547,"This was our first visit  The chicken enchiladas were delicious. The meat was moist, tender and flavorful even without the sauce. The enchilada sauce was the right consistency, flavorful and not salty. The steak on the taco was grilled and flavorful. I guess you can see that I use the word 'flavorful' three times already! Some places use too much salt to try to enhance the taste of the food, but they did not do that. I would come back in a flash. There's a free public parking lot next to the restaurant and metered parking on the street."
548,"Great casual eatery with tasty offerings. Thursday 7p.m. dinner time with plenty of folks enjoying their meals. Luckily, there was no line at the order counter. My friend suggested tortilla soup and horchata. She also got a torta and a carne asada taco. Nice rich flavored soup. I'll look forward to another visit when I'm hangry. I was still full from the buffet lunch at Galeto Brazilian Steakhouse in Oakland!  Staff were helpful and pleasant."
549,"I've been coming here for a few years, but this is my first time writing a review about this place. I work down the street from here and   a coworker of mine told me about it. The food here is pretty good, everything is made fresh. Especially their tortillas, I love the taste of fresh warm tortillas. It's so soft and delicious.I've gotten the ""papas con crema"" which is basically potato fritters with cheese inside of it and a drizzle of sour cream on top. That one is really good as well. But my most favorite that I always get is either the tuna ceviche or shrimp ceviche with fresh fried tortilla chips. I actually tried their fish tacos for the first time and I thought it was ok. I feel like it needs a little bit more flavor. It was sort of bland. And the aioli sauce didn't have much taste to it neither. I guess I was comparing it to Rubio's.Anyways the ambience is nice and clean. You could also watch them make your food because the kitchen is visible. My only problem with this place is I can never call in my order. I usually come here on my lunch break and it would make it so much better if I can call in my order so I can just be in and out and enjoy my lunch without feeling so rushed. But for some reason they never answer their phones. I understand that they can be busy sometimes but every time I've came on my lunch there's no line and I've asked them why weren't they answering their phones. Sometimes they say that they were  busy and it just died down or one time they didn't even know where the phone was at. It would be nice if I can just call in my order and just pick it up without having to wait. However the food has me coming back for more. I definitely recommend this place."
550,"I hardly write reviews but the service here has been poor consistently and not worth the price you pay.  An attitude of ""There will be someone behind you in line anyways"".  Avoid."
551,"Welp.  When you charge $9 for one Chile relleno, it better be amazing.  Meh food for omg this is life-changing prices loses you a few stars :("
552,"Ate dinner snack here. Chili relleno and chips and salsa. Tasted good. Decor after cinco de mayo. Self seating, order your items, get number, and they bring to your table. Parking on the street after 6pm free else 2 hours limit daytime."
553,"I've always had this love hate relationship with this place. I think it's because Richmond has cheap Mexican eats. This place is seated in the busy 4th Street strip in Berkeley. So I get it, it's shi-shi Mexican food, even though there's nothing in particular that sets it apart from the cheaper places, in my mind, except for location and handmade tortillas all the time. I've had fish tacos here, the crispy pollo tacos, the tortilla soup-- umm didn't like that. And the other day got one sopa de chorizo y papas. That's pretty yummy. I think the sopa shell was a lil crunchy for my liking. I'd rather have it be a lil denser. Also one sopa is $6.95. Yikes!And finally you gotta buy chips and salsa separately. Ya ya fine fine.The food's okay-- it's not spectacular. The line moves fast though, you're not going to wait an hour for a table, like at Bette's down the street."
554,The quality of food was not good. The cashier was very rude. I won't ever go here. Had soft and crispy taco. None was good. Enchilada with raw chicken. Guacamole not bad.
555,"Lengua is so so, kinda pricey for one taco. Tamal has good flavors, kinda salty though. The mole has a bit of a kick. The chips and salsa was salty and hard, wish it had other salsa to dip in. Location is in a nice spot, parking and what not. Food comes out super fast."
556,Underwhelming tacos for premium prices.  That might as well be the ad slogan.  Can't say the good was bad (though the chips were hard enough to worry about breaking a tooth).  But I can't say this was rewarding food either.  Just mostly flavorless meh.  Very disappointing.
557,"I was (probably delusional) optimist about this place off the 4th street shopping center for a quick-ish bite to eat. After standing in line for a good long while, we settled on tacos and enchiladas. Food looked good, prices are a bit much for how small the portions are (avoid the non-alcoholic drinks at all cost... they are crazy expensive which we learned the hard way). Waited a while for our food, and man... that was a disappointment. It didn't taste bad. It just tasted meh. The asada is meat, so I supposes it's not false advertising. But if anyone has ever had actually good carna asada... this is no where close. The enchiladas were better than the tacos, but still that's not saying much. We could have gotten the same tastes at an American ""Mexican"" chain restaurant. Won't be back. Bummer."
558,"I went here based on my sister's past visits and I was disappointed!  I decided to try something totally different and I had the sope.  It was awesome - a crispy corn cake with potatoes,  chorizo,  and black beans.  It doesn't look big but it is filling!  Now,  I'm on a, mission to find sopes in my neighborhood but I fear they may not be as good as Tacubayas!  Good job guys and thank you for introducing me to something new.  On a side note,  my sister also recommended the home made churros."
559,"Love this place. Every time we come here it's delicious. Wonderful service. So authentic. Chilaquiles is one of my favorites, menudo y friholes. Mmm"
560,"Tacubaya is a small Mexican restaurant located in an affluent area of Berkeley. Let me start with that I had a new person help me with the register and he not only forgot to give me utensils, my receipt and my number for the server to know where and who the order went to. But, I'm fair and not going to dock (much) a newbie or the restaurant for a new employee.I got the Torta Vegetariano, which was a vegetarian Torta with no cheese. It had a V next to it for Vegan but had cheese on it so I had to request it to be taken off. If you guys haven't heard I've covered to Vega so I no longer eat meat or fish (I never ate cheese).I also got a strawberry agua fresca and it was amazing! I loved the flavor and how fresh it tasted. I felt that they added sugar to it though, but overall it was delicious.The Torta was amazing, I added hella spice to it, but the bread and the vegetables were grilled to perfection. I definitely recommend stopping by and getting a bite to eat! The food came out quick and it was cheap as well.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me, I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
561,"I loved my vegetarian whole bean taco!! Everything was perfectly fresh. I don't mind paying a bit more for fresh & home made corn tortillas made in front of you while you order... BONUS! It's a perfect place to eat for our little jaunts to Madewell, Lulu & Anthropologie in Berkeley. This is a stand in line , order, get a number & sit down cafe. They were quick & pleasant with their system. Our Modesto stand in line to order & sit w/a number for delivery should take note! My daughter ordered the chicken enchiladas.. they were beautiful and made w/homemade corn tortillas as well. My daughter found a rather large vein googly thing in her chicken and she asked what it was... they immediately offered to remake. Love that! But we were out of time, so we said no. Without even telling us, they took them off our tab and refunded us!! Whoa. Customers matter! They didn't have to do that, after all it was her 2nd enchilada.... def. will be back! And, the homemade quacamole w/ homemade tortilla chips made to order... yummmmy!!! Reminds me of Santa Barbara restaurants. :)"

I understand that they can be busy sometimes but every time I've came on my lunch there's no line and I've asked them why weren't they answering their phones. Sometimes they say that they were  busy and it just died down or one time they didn't even know where the phone was at. It would be nice if I can just call in my order and just pick it up without having to wait. However the food has me coming back for more. I definitely recommend this place."
590,"I hardly write reviews but the service here has been poor consistently and not worth the price you pay.  An attitude of ""There will be someone behind you in line anyways"".  Avoid."
591,"Welp.  When you charge $9 for one Chile relleno, it better be amazing.  Meh food for omg this is life-changing prices loses you a few stars :("

I've had fish tacos here, the crispy pollo tacos, the tortilla soup-- umm didn't like that. And the other day got one sopa de chorizo y papas. That's pretty yummy. I think the sopa shell was a lil crunchy for my liking. I'd rather have it be a lil denser. Also one sopa is $6.95. Yikes!And finally you gotta buy chips and salsa separately. Ya ya fine fine.The food's okay-- it's not spectacular. The line moves fast though, you're not going to wait an hour for a table, like at Bette's down the street."
594,The quality of food was not good. The cashier was very rude. I won't ever go here. Had soft and crispy taco. None was good. Enchilada with raw chicken. Guacamole not bad.
595,"Lengua is so so, kinda pricey for one taco. Tamal has good flavors, kinda salty though. The mole has a bit of a kick. The chips and salsa was salty and hard, wish it had other salsa to dip in. Location is in a nice spot, parking and what not. Food comes out super fast."
596,Underwhelming tacos for premium prices.  That might as well be the ad slogan.  Can't say the good was bad (though the chips were hard enough to worry about breaking a tooth).  But I can't say this was rewarding food either.  Just mostly flavorless meh.  Very disappointing.
597,"I was (probably delusional) optimist about this place off the 4th street shopping center for a quick-ish bite to eat. After standing in line for a good long while, we settled on tacos and enchiladas. Food looked good, prices are a bit much for how small the portions are (avoid the non-alcoholic drinks at all cost... they are crazy expensive which we learned the hard way). Waited a while for our food, and man... that was a disappointment. It didn't taste bad. It just tasted meh. The asada is meat, so I supposes it's not false advertising. But if anyone has ever had actually good carna asada... this is no where close. The enchiladas were better than the tacos, but still that's not saying much. We could have gotten the same tastes at an American ""Mexican"" chain restaurant. Won't be back. Bummer."
598,"I went here based on my sister's past visits and I was disappointed!  I decided to try something totally different and I had the sope.  It was awesome - a crispy corn cake with potatoes,  chorizo,  and black beans.  It doesn't look big but it is filling!  Now,  I'm on a, mission to find sopes in my neighborhood but I fear they may not be as good as Tacubayas!  Good job guys and thank you for introducing me to something new.  On a side note,  my sister also recommended the home made churros."

600,"Tacubaya is a small Mexican restaurant located in an affluent area of Berkeley.

But, I'm fair and not going to dock (much) a newbie or the restaurant for a new employee.I got the Torta Vegetariano, which was a vegetarian Torta with no cheese.

601,"I loved my vegetarian whole bean taco!! Everything was perfectly fresh. I don't mind paying a bit more for fresh & home made corn tortillas made in front of you while you order... BONUS! It's a perfect place to eat for our little jaunts to Madewell, Lulu & Anthropologie in Berkeley. This is a stand in line , order, get a number & sit down cafe. They were quick & pleasant with their system. Our Modesto stand in line to order & sit w/a number for delivery should take note! My daughter ordered the chicken enchiladas.. they were beautiful and made w/homemade corn tortillas as well. My daughter found a rather large vein googly thing in her chicken and she asked what it was... they immediately offered to remake. Love that! But we were out of time, so we said no. Without even telling us, they took them off our tab and refunded us!! Whoa. Customers matter! They didn't have to do that, after all it was her 2nd enchilada.... def. will be back! And, the homemade quacamole w/ homemade tortilla chips made to order... yummmmy!!! Reminds me of Santa Barbara restaurants. :)"
602,"66% RATIO OF HAIR TO BITES!This place is generally okay.  It's a bit bland for Mexican food, but it's not awful and usually fresh and sanitary.  BUT .... yesterday I ordered a shrimp ceviche special and was about two bites in before my friend noticed a HAIR IN MY FOOD, glimmering in the afternoon sunlight.  Gross!  I looked at the line, and it was super crowded and started thinking ""Hmmm, maybe ONE HAIR won't kill me.""  So, against my better judgment (and in the midst of my friend silently judging my choice) and because I have worked in a restaurant before, I was going to let it go.Until I found a SECOND HAIR!  This hair was NOT lying on top, having blown over by the Berkeley wind.  It was clearly MIXED IN to the food!  So, that's too much, right - three bites and two hairs???  (For those counting, it's 66% of bites with hair.)So, I return it - fine they will take it off my bill.  SO HERE IS THE REALLY TERRIBLE PART - - - BEFORE ORDERING THE CEVICHE, i ASKED IF IT WAS ALREADY MADE, (because I would have liked to omit something), and they said YES, so NOT MADE TO ORDER.  I got it anyway.  The people ordering it after I returned the hairy mess also got it, and the people after them, and so on, and so on, because the kitchen DID NOT THROW IT OUT!Here's an interesting twist - none of the chefs working that day had hair that length so, I think the hair happened in prep, not that it matters but it wasn't the guys there to blame.  Would I like something else?  Again, against my better judgment I ask for a carne asada taco (for which I was charged - no apology taco?)  Anyway, underseasoned, boring asada, but edible and HAIRLESS, so bonus!  Seriously, if y'all ever go to Mexico City - it will kill this place for you.  Not worth the wait, the money, or the effort to locate random hairs.P.S. BUSSING MY OWN TABLE:I also had to go and get a shift towel and wipe down our table before we seated ourselves because the people working there only wipe one table down out of three, and ours was not the lucky winner (apparently hadn't been in several hours, given the dried salsas and such on it.)  So much for the tip I added to my card!"
603,"Stopped by here for a late lunch during the 4th street fair. This is the type of place where you order at the register and give you a number. There is outside and plenty of indoor seating. For food we ordered 2 vegetarian tacos, quesadilla for the lil one and hubby got a spring mixed salad with pepino seeds. Hubby's salad with refreshing, my vegetarian taco with whole pinto beans was good but not worth raving, I could have made something like this at home. If you want chips and salsa, that's extra to buy. I hear the churros here are the bomb, must try next time."
604,"Tacubaya is my fourth street staple and something to always look forward to amid the challenge of looking for a parking spot! Great menu, affordable for the area, and super flavorful food! I did take out and ordered two crispy chicken tacos, one taco al pastor, and a pork tamal. The pastor was not overly greasy, it was crispy yet tender, and was delicious with the fresh tortilla and guacamole! The pork tamal really blew my mind--covered in a dark mole, the masa to pork ratio was perfect, and the pork was very flavorful. Will definitely go back for the tamal! If you are looking for quality Mexican with California freshness, go to Tacubaya! Casual, order at the counter, and good food!!!"
605,"2.5 -but the staff was super nice. Came here for lunch today. The place was hopping with business and there is plenty of room for seating . All staff was friendly, helpful and efficient and the establishment was very clean. We ordered chips and salsa, beef enchiladas and a tostada with sweet potatoes and chicken. The chips were thick and very hard and the salsa was just generic with little to no flavor. The enchilada was better, but again- lacked flavor. Nothing special about it. The tostada was not good and the meat was tough - although it had more flavor than the rest. I don't think I would come here again.  Meh..just OK."
606,"The battered & fried pollock, fish, $4.15,  and pork, $4 street tacos were delicious, perfectly cooked and served hot. My wife had a delicious made to order Chili Relleno $8.75. expensive but worth it."
607,"This was our first visit  The chicken enchiladas were delicious. The meat was moist, tender and flavorful even without the sauce. The enchilada sauce was the right consistency, flavorful and not salty. The steak on the taco was grilled and flavorful. I guess you can see that I use the word 'flavorful' three times already! Some places use too much salt to try to enhance the taste of the food, but they did not do that. I would come back in a flash. There's a free public parking lot next to the restaurant and metered parking on the street."
608,"Great casual eatery with tasty offerings. Thursday 7p.m. dinner time with plenty of folks enjoying their meals. Luckily, there was no line at the order counter. My friend suggested tortilla soup and horchata. She also got a torta and a carne asada taco. Nice rich flavored soup. I'll look forward to another visit when I'm hangry. I was still full from the buffet lunch at Galeto Brazilian Steakhouse in Oakland!  Staff were helpful and pleasant."
609,"I've been coming here for a few years, but this is my first time writing a review about this place. I work down the street from here and   a coworker of mine told me about it. The food here is pretty good, everything is made fresh. Especially their tortillas, I love the taste of fresh warm tortillas. It's so soft and delicious.I've gotten the ""papas con crema"" which is basically potato fritters with cheese inside of it and a drizzle of sour cream on top. That one is really good as well. But my most favorite that I always get is either the tuna ceviche or shrimp ceviche with fresh fried tortilla chips. I actually tried their fish tacos for the first time and I thought it was ok. I feel like it needs a little bit more flavor. It was sort of bland. And the aioli sauce didn't have much taste to it neither. I guess I was comparing it to Rubio's.Anyways the ambience is nice and clean. You could also watch them make your food because the kitchen is visible. My only problem with this place is I can never call in my order. I usually come here on my lunch break and it would make it so much better if I can call in my order so I can just be in and out and enjoy my lunch without feeling so rushed. But for some reason they never answer their phones.

And, the homemade quacamole w/ homemade tortilla chips made to order... yummmmy!!! Reminds me of Santa Barbara restaurants. :)"
642,"66% RATIO OF HAIR TO BITES!This place is generally okay.  It's a bit bland for Mexican food, but it's not awful and usually fresh and sanitary.  BUT .... yesterday I ordered a shrimp ceviche special and was about two bites in before my friend noticed a HAIR IN MY FOOD, glimmering in the afternoon sunlight.  Gross!  I looked at the line, and it was super crowded and started thinking ""Hmmm, maybe ONE HAIR won't kill me.""  So, against my better judgment (and in the midst of my friend silently judging my choice) and because I have worked in a restaurant before, I was going to let it go.Until I found a SECOND HAIR!  This hair was NOT lying on top, having blown over by the Berkeley wind.  It was clearly MIXED IN to the food!  So, that's too much, right - three bites and two hairs???  (For those counting, it's 66% of bites with hair.)So, I return it - fine they will take it off my bill.  SO HERE IS THE REALLY TERRIBLE PART - - - BEFORE ORDERING THE CEVICHE, i ASKED IF IT WAS ALREADY MADE, (because I would have liked to omit something), and they said YES, so NOT MADE TO ORDER.  I got it anyway.  The people ordering it after I returned the hairy mess also got it, and the people after them, and so on, and so on, because the kitchen DID NOT THROW IT OUT!Here's an interesting twist - none of the chefs working that day had hair that length so, I think the hair happened in prep, not that it matters but it wasn't the guys there to blame.  Would I like something else?  Again, against my better judgment I ask for a carne asada taco (for which I was charged - no apology taco?)  Anyway, underseasoned, boring asada, but edible and HAIRLESS, so bonus!  Seriously, if y'all ever go to Mexico City - it will kill this place for you.  Not worth the wait, the money, or the effort to locate random hairs.P.S. BUSSING MY OWN TABLE:I also had to go and get a shift towel and wipe down our table before we seated ourselves because the people working there only wipe one table down out of three, and ours was not the lucky winner (apparently hadn't been in several hours, given the dried salsas and such on it.)  So much for the tip I added to my card!"
643,"Stopped by here for a late lunch during the 4th street fair. This is the type of place where you order at the register and give you a number. There is outside and plenty of indoor seating. For food we ordered 2 vegetarian tacos, quesadilla for the lil one and hubby got a spring mixed salad with pepino seeds. Hubby's salad with refreshing, my vegetarian taco with whole pinto beans was good but not worth raving, I could have made something like this at home. If you want chips and salsa, that's extra to buy. I hear the churros here are the bomb, must try next time."
644,"Tacubaya is my fourth street staple and something to always look forward to amid the challenge of looking for a parking spot! Great menu, affordable for the area, and super flavorful food! I did take out and ordered two crispy chicken tacos, one taco al pastor, and a pork tamal. The pastor was not overly greasy, it was crispy yet tender, and was delicious with the fresh tortilla and guacamole! The pork tamal really blew my mind--covered in a dark mole, the masa to pork ratio was perfect, and the pork was very flavorful. Will definitely go back for the tamal! If you are looking for quality Mexican with California freshness, go to Tacubaya! Casual, order at the counter, and good food!!!"
645,"2.5 -but the staff was super nice. Came here for lunch today. The place was hopping with business and there is plenty of room for seating . All staff was friendly, helpful and efficient and the establishment was very clean. We ordered chips and salsa, beef enchiladas and a tostada with sweet potatoes and chicken. The chips were thick and very hard and the salsa was just generic with little to no flavor. The enchilada was better, but again- lacked flavor. Nothing special about it. The tostada was not good and the meat was tough - although it had more flavor than the rest. I don't think I would come here again.  Meh..just OK."
646,"The battered & fried pollock, fish, $4.15,  and pork, $4 street tacos were delicious, perfectly cooked and served hot. My wife had a delicious made to order Chili Relleno $8.75. expensive but worth it."
647,"This was our first visit  The chicken enchiladas were delicious. The meat was moist, tender and flavorful even without the sauce. The enchilada sauce was the right consistency, flavorful and not salty. The steak on the taco was grilled and flavorful. I guess you can see that I use the word 'flavorful' three times already! Some places use too much salt to try to enhance the taste of the food, but they did not do that. I would come back in a flash. There's a free public parking lot next to the restaurant and metered parking on the street."
648,"Great casual eatery with tasty offerings. Thursday 7p.m. dinner time with plenty of folks enjoying their meals. Luckily, there was no line at the order counter. My friend suggested tortilla soup and horchata. She also got a torta and a carne asada taco. Nice rich flavored soup. I'll look forward to another visit when I'm hangry. I was still full from the buffet lunch at Galeto Brazilian Steakhouse in Oakland!  Staff were helpful and pleasant."
649,"I've been coming here for a few years, but this is my first time writing a review about this place. I work down the street from here and   a coworker of mine told me about it. The food here is pretty good, everything is made fresh. Especially their tortillas, I love the taste of fresh warm tortillas. It's so soft and delicious.I've gotten the ""papas con crema"" which is basically potato fritters with cheese inside of it and a drizzle of sour cream on top. That one is really good as well. But my most favorite that I always get is either the tuna ceviche or shrimp ceviche with fresh fried tortilla chips. I actually tried their fish tacos for the first time and I thought it was ok. I feel like it needs a little bit more flavor. It was sort of bland. And the aioli sauce didn't have much taste to it neither. I guess I was comparing it to Rubio's.Anyways the ambience is nice and clean. You could also watch them make your food because the kitchen is visible. My only problem with this place is I can never call in my order. I usually come here on my lunch break and it would make it so much better if I can call in my order so I can just be in and out and enjoy my lunch without feeling so rushed. But for some reason they never answer their phones. I understand that they can be busy sometimes but every time I've came on my lunch there's no line and I've asked them why weren't they answering their phones. Sometimes they say that they were  busy and it just died down or one time they didn't even know where the phone was at. It would be nice if I can just call in my order and just pick it up without having to wait. However the food has me coming back for more. I definitely recommend this place."
650,"I hardly write reviews but the service here has been poor consistently and not worth the price you pay.  An attitude of ""There will be someone behind you in line anyways"".  Avoid."
651,"Welp.  When you charge $9 for one Chile relleno, it better be amazing.  Meh food for omg this is life-changing prices loses you a few stars :("
652,"Ate dinner snack here. Chili relleno and chips and salsa. Tasted good. Decor after cinco de mayo. Self seating, order your items, get number, and they bring to your table. Parking on the street after 6pm free else 2 hours limit daytime."
653,"I've always had this love hate relationship with this place. I think it's because Richmond has cheap Mexican eats. This place is seated in the busy 4th Street strip in Berkeley. So I get it, it's shi-shi Mexican food, even though there's nothing in particular that sets it apart from the cheaper places, in my mind, except for location and handmade tortillas all the time. I've had fish tacos here, the crispy pollo tacos, the tortilla soup-- umm didn't like that. And the other day got one sopa de chorizo y papas. That's pretty yummy. I think the sopa shell was a lil crunchy for my liking. I'd rather have it be a lil denser. Also one sopa is $6.95. Yikes!And finally you gotta buy chips and salsa separately. Ya ya fine fine.The food's okay-- it's not spectacular. The line moves fast though, you're not going to wait an hour for a table, like at Bette's down the street."
654,The quality of food was not good. The cashier was very rude. I won't ever go here. Had soft and crispy taco. None was good. Enchilada with raw chicken. Guacamole not bad.
655,"Lengua is so so, kinda pricey for one taco. Tamal has good flavors, kinda salty though. The mole has a bit of a kick. The chips and salsa was salty and hard, wish it had other salsa to dip in. Location is in a nice spot, parking and what not. Food comes out super fast."
656,Underwhelming tacos for premium prices.  That might as well be the ad slogan.  Can't say the good was bad (though the chips were hard enough to worry about breaking a tooth).  But I can't say this was rewarding food either.  Just mostly flavorless meh.  Very disappointing.
657,"I was (probably delusional) optimist about this place off the 4th street shopping center for a quick-ish bite to eat. After standing in line for a good long while, we settled on tacos and enchiladas. Food looked good, prices are a bit much for how small the portions are (avoid the non-alcoholic drinks at all cost... they are crazy expensive which we learned the hard way). Waited a while for our food, and man... that was a disappointment. It didn't taste bad. It just tasted meh. The asada is meat, so I supposes it's not false advertising. But if anyone has ever had actually good carna asada... this is no where close. The enchiladas were better than the tacos, but still that's not saying much. We could have gotten the same tastes at an American ""Mexican"" chain restaurant. Won't be back. Bummer."
658,"I went here based on my sister's past visits and I was disappointed!  I decided to try something totally different and I had the sope.  It was awesome - a crispy corn cake with potatoes,  chorizo,  and black beans.  It doesn't look big but it is filling!  Now,  I'm on a, mission to find sopes in my neighborhood but I fear they may not be as good as Tacubayas!  Good job guys and thank you for introducing me to something new.  On a side note,  my sister also recommended the home made churros."
659,"Love this place. Every time we come here it's delicious. Wonderful service. So authentic. Chilaquiles is one of my favorites, menudo y friholes. Mmm"
660,"Tacubaya is a small Mexican restaurant located in an affluent area of Berkeley. Let me start with that I had a new person help me with the register and he not only forgot to give me utensils, my receipt and my number for the server to know where and who the order went to. But, I'm fair and not going to dock (much) a newbie or the restaurant for a new employee.I got the Torta Vegetariano, which was a vegetarian Torta with no cheese. It had a V next to it for Vegan but had cheese on it so I had to request it to be taken off. If you guys haven't heard I've covered to Vega so I no longer eat meat or fish (I never ate cheese).I also got a strawberry agua fresca and it was amazing! I loved the flavor and how fresh it tasted. I felt that they added sugar to it though, but overall it was delicious.The Torta was amazing, I added hella spice to it, but the bread and the vegetables were grilled to perfection. I definitely recommend stopping by and getting a bite to eat! The food came out quick and it was cheap as well.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me, I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
661,"I loved my vegetarian whole bean taco!! Everything was perfectly fresh. I don't mind paying a bit more for fresh & home made corn tortillas made in front of you while you order... BONUS! It's a perfect place to eat for our little jaunts to Madewell, Lulu & Anthropologie in Berkeley. This is a stand in line , order, get a number & sit down cafe. They were quick & pleasant with their system. Our Modesto stand in line to order & sit w/a number for delivery should take note! My daughter ordered the chicken enchiladas.. they were beautiful and made w/homemade corn tortillas as well. My daughter found a rather large vein googly thing in her chicken and she asked what it was... they immediately offered to remake. Love that! But we were out of time, so we said no. Without even telling us, they took them off our tab and refunded us!! Whoa. Customers matter! They didn't have to do that, after all it was her 2nd enchilada.... def. will be back!

I guess I was comparing it to Rubio's.Anyways the ambience is nice and clean. You could also watch them make your food because the kitchen is visible. My only problem with this place is I can never call in my order. I usually come here on my lunch break and it would make it so much better if I can call in my order so I can just be in and out and enjoy my lunch without feeling so rushed. But for some reason they never answer their phones. I understand that they can be busy sometimes but every time I've came on my lunch there's no line and I've asked them why weren't they answering their phones. Sometimes they say that they were  busy and it just died down or one time they didn't even know where the phone was at. It would be nice if I can just call in my order and just pick it up without having to wait. However the food has me coming back for more. I definitely recommend this place."

691,"Welp.  When you charge $9 for one Chile relleno, it better be amazing.  Meh food for omg this is life-changing prices loses you a few stars :("

I've had fish tacos here, the crispy pollo tacos, the tortilla soup-- umm didn't like that. And the other day got one sopa de chorizo y papas. That's pretty yummy. I think the sopa shell was a lil crunchy for my liking. I'd rather have it be a lil denser. Also one sopa is $6.95. Yikes!And finally you gotta buy chips and salsa separately. Ya ya fine fine.The food's okay-- it's not spectacular. The line moves fast though, you're not going to wait an hour for a table, like at Bette's down the street."
694,The quality of food was not good. The cashier was very rude. I won't ever go here. Had soft and crispy taco. None was good. Enchilada with raw chicken. Guacamole not bad.
695,"Lengua is so so, kinda pricey for one taco. Tamal has good flavors, kinda salty though. The mole has a bit of a kick. The chips and salsa was salty and hard, wish it had other salsa to dip in. Location is in a nice spot, parking and what not. Food comes out super fast."
696,Underwhelming tacos for premium prices.  That might as well be the ad slogan.  Can't say the good was bad (though the chips were hard enough to worry about breaking a tooth).  But I can't say this was rewarding food either.  Just mostly flavorless meh.  Very disappointing.
697,"I was (probably delusional) optimist about this place off the 4th street shopping center for a quick-ish bite to eat. After standing in line for a good long while, we settled on tacos and enchiladas. Food looked good, prices are a bit much for how small the portions are (avoid the non-alcoholic drinks at all cost... they are crazy expensive which we learned the hard way). Waited a while for our food, and man... that was a disappointment. It didn't taste bad. It just tasted meh. The asada is meat, so I supposes it's not false advertising. But if anyone has ever had actually good carna asada... this is no where close. The enchiladas were better than the tacos, but still that's not saying much. We could have gotten the same tastes at an American ""Mexican"" chain restaurant. Won't be back. Bummer."
698,"I went here based on my sister's past visits and I was disappointed!  I decided to try something totally different and I had the sope.  It was awesome - a crispy corn cake with potatoes,  chorizo,  and black beans.  It doesn't look big but it is filling!  Now,  I'm on a, mission to find sopes in my neighborhood but I fear they may not be as good as Tacubayas!  Good job guys and thank you for introducing me to something new.  On a side note,  my sister also recommended the home made churros."

700,"Tacubaya is a small Mexican restaurant located in an affluent area of Berkeley. Let me start with that I had a new person help me with the register and he not only forgot to give me utensils, my receipt and my number for the server to know where and who the order went to. But, I'm fair and not going to dock (much) a newbie or the restaurant for a new employee.I got the Torta Vegetariano, which was a vegetarian Torta with no cheese. It had a V next to it for Vegan but had cheese on it so I had to request it to be taken off. If you guys haven't heard I've covered to Vega so I no longer eat meat or fish (I never ate cheese).I also got a strawberry agua fresca and it was amazing! I loved the flavor and how fresh it tasted. I felt that they added sugar to it though, but overall it was delicious.The Torta was amazing, I added hella spice to it, but the bread and the vegetables were grilled to perfection.

701,"I loved my vegetarian whole bean taco!! Everything was perfectly fresh. I don't mind paying a bit more for fresh & home made corn tortillas made in front of you while you order... BONUS! It's a perfect place to eat for our little jaunts to Madewell, Lulu & Anthropologie in Berkeley. This is a stand in line , order, get a number & sit down cafe. They were quick & pleasant with their system. Our Modesto stand in line to order & sit w/a number for delivery should take note! My daughter ordered the chicken enchiladas.. they were beautiful and made w/homemade corn tortillas as well. My daughter found a rather large vein googly thing in her chicken and she asked what it was... they immediately offered to remake. Love that! But we were out of time, so we said no. Without even telling us, they took them off our tab and refunded us!! Whoa. Customers matter! They didn't have to do that, after all it was her 2nd enchilada.... def. will be back! And, the homemade quacamole w/ homemade tortilla chips made to order... yummmmy!!! Reminds me of Santa Barbara restaurants. :)"
702,"66% RATIO OF HAIR TO BITES!This place is generally okay.  It's a bit bland for Mexican food, but it's not awful and usually fresh and sanitary.  BUT .... yesterday I ordered a shrimp ceviche special and was about two bites in before my friend noticed a HAIR IN MY FOOD, glimmering in the afternoon sunlight.  Gross!  I looked at the line, and it was super crowded and started thinking ""Hmmm, maybe ONE HAIR won't kill me.""  So, against my better judgment (and in the midst of my friend silently judging my choice) and because I have worked in a restaurant before, I was going to let it go.Until I found a SECOND HAIR!  This hair was NOT lying on top, having blown over by the Berkeley wind.  It was clearly MIXED IN to the food!  So, that's too much, right - three bites and two hairs???  (For those counting, it's 66% of bites with hair.)So, I return it - fine they will take it off my bill.  SO HERE IS THE REALLY TERRIBLE PART - - - BEFORE ORDERING THE CEVICHE, i ASKED IF IT WAS ALREADY MADE, (because I would have liked to omit something), and they said YES, so NOT MADE TO ORDER.  I got it anyway.  The people ordering it after I returned the hairy mess also got it, and the people after them, and so on, and so on, because the kitchen DID NOT THROW IT OUT!Here's an interesting twist - none of the chefs working that day had hair that length so, I think the hair happened in prep, not that it matters but it wasn't the guys there to blame.  Would I like something else?  Again, against my better judgment I ask for a carne asada taco (for which I was charged - no apology taco?)  Anyway, underseasoned, boring asada, but edible and HAIRLESS, so bonus!  Seriously, if y'all ever go to Mexico City - it will kill this place for you.  Not worth the wait, the money, or the effort to locate random hairs.P.S. BUSSING MY OWN TABLE:I also had to go and get a shift towel and wipe down our table before we seated ourselves because the people working there only wipe one table down out of three, and ours was not the lucky winner (apparently hadn't been in several hours, given the dried salsas and such on it.)  So much for the tip I added to my card!"
703,"Stopped by here for a late lunch during the 4th street fair. This is the type of place where you order at the register and give you a number. There is outside and plenty of indoor seating. For food we ordered 2 vegetarian tacos, quesadilla for the lil one and hubby got a spring mixed salad with pepino seeds. Hubby's salad with refreshing, my vegetarian taco with whole pinto beans was good but not worth raving, I could have made something like this at home. If you want chips and salsa, that's extra to buy. I hear the churros here are the bomb, must try next time."
704,"Tacubaya is my fourth street staple and something to always look forward to amid the challenge of looking for a parking spot! Great menu, affordable for the area, and super flavorful food! I did take out and ordered two crispy chicken tacos, one taco al pastor, and a pork tamal. The pastor was not overly greasy, it was crispy yet tender, and was delicious with the fresh tortilla and guacamole! The pork tamal really blew my mind--covered in a dark mole, the masa to pork ratio was perfect, and the pork was very flavorful. Will definitely go back for the tamal! If you are looking for quality Mexican with California freshness, go to Tacubaya! Casual, order at the counter, and good food!!!"
705,"2.5 -but the staff was super nice. Came here for lunch today. The place was hopping with business and there is plenty of room for seating . All staff was friendly, helpful and efficient and the establishment was very clean. We ordered chips and salsa, beef enchiladas and a tostada with sweet potatoes and chicken. The chips were thick and very hard and the salsa was just generic with little to no flavor. The enchilada was better, but again- lacked flavor. Nothing special about it. The tostada was not good and the meat was tough - although it had more flavor than the rest. I don't think I would come here again.  Meh..just OK."
706,"The battered & fried pollock, fish, $4.15,  and pork, $4 street tacos were delicious, perfectly cooked and served hot. My wife had a delicious made to order Chili Relleno $8.75. expensive but worth it."
707,"This was our first visit  The chicken enchiladas were delicious. The meat was moist, tender and flavorful even without the sauce. The enchilada sauce was the right consistency, flavorful and not salty. The steak on the taco was grilled and flavorful. I guess you can see that I use the word 'flavorful' three times already! Some places use too much salt to try to enhance the taste of the food, but they did not do that. I would come back in a flash. There's a free public parking lot next to the restaurant and metered parking on the street."
708,"Great casual eatery with tasty offerings. Thursday 7p.m. dinner time with plenty of folks enjoying their meals. Luckily, there was no line at the order counter. My friend suggested tortilla soup and horchata. She also got a torta and a carne asada taco. Nice rich flavored soup. I'll look forward to another visit when I'm hangry. I was still full from the buffet lunch at Galeto Brazilian Steakhouse in Oakland!  Staff were helpful and pleasant."
709,"I've been coming here for a few years, but this is my first time writing a review about this place. I work down the street from here and   a coworker of mine told me about it. The food here is pretty good, everything is made fresh. Especially their tortillas, I love the taste of fresh warm tortillas. It's so soft and delicious.I've gotten the ""papas con crema"" which is basically potato fritters with cheese inside of it and a drizzle of sour cream on top. That one is really good as well. But my most favorite that I always get is either the tuna ceviche or shrimp ceviche with fresh fried tortilla chips. I actually tried their fish tacos for the first time and I thought it was ok. I feel like it needs a little bit more flavor. It was sort of bland. And the aioli sauce didn't have much taste to it neither. I guess I was comparing it to Rubio's.Anyways the ambience is nice and clean. You could also watch them make your food because the kitchen is visible. My only problem with this place is I can never call in my order. I usually come here on my lunch break and it would make it so much better if I can call in my order so I can just be in and out and enjoy my lunch without feeling so rushed.

They were quick & pleasant with their system. Our Modesto stand in line to order & sit w/a number for delivery should take note! My daughter ordered the chicken enchiladas.. they were beautiful and made w/homemade corn tortillas as well. My daughter found a rather large vein googly thing in her chicken and she asked what it was... they immediately offered to remake. Love that! But we were out of time, so we said no.

742,"66% RATIO OF HAIR TO BITES!This place is generally okay.  It's a bit bland for Mexican food, but it's not awful and usually fresh and sanitary.  BUT .... yesterday I ordered a shrimp ceviche special and was about two bites in before my friend noticed a HAIR IN MY FOOD, glimmering in the afternoon sunlight.  Gross!  I looked at the line, and it was super crowded and started thinking ""Hmmm, maybe ONE HAIR won't kill me.""  So, against my better judgment (and in the midst of my friend silently judging my choice) and because I have worked in a restaurant before, I was going to let it go.Until I found a SECOND HAIR!  This hair was NOT lying on top, having blown over by the Berkeley wind.  It was clearly MIXED IN to the food!  So, that's too much, right - three bites and two hairs???  (For those counting, it's 66% of bites with hair.)So, I return it - fine they will take it off my bill.  SO HERE IS THE REALLY TERRIBLE PART - - - BEFORE ORDERING THE CEVICHE, i ASKED IF IT WAS ALREADY MADE, (because I would have liked to omit something), and they said YES, so NOT MADE TO ORDER.  I got it anyway.  The people ordering it after I returned the hairy mess also got it, and the people after them, and so on, and so on, because the kitchen DID NOT THROW IT OUT!Here's an interesting twist - none of the chefs working that day had hair that length so, I think the hair happened in prep, not that it matters but it wasn't the guys there to blame.  Would I like something else?  Again, against my better judgment I ask for a carne asada taco (for which I was charged - no apology taco?)  Anyway, underseasoned, boring asada, but edible and HAIRLESS, so bonus!  Seriously, if y'all ever go to Mexico City - it will kill this place for you.  Not worth the wait, the money, or the effort to locate random hairs.P.S. BUSSING MY OWN TABLE:I also had to go and get a shift towel and wipe down our table before we seated ourselves because the people working there only wipe one table down out of three, and ours was not the lucky winner (apparently hadn't been in several hours, given the dried salsas and such on it.)  So much for the tip I added to my card!"
743,"Stopped by here for a late lunch during the 4th street fair. This is the type of place where you order at the register and give you a number. There is outside and plenty of indoor seating. For food we ordered 2 vegetarian tacos, quesadilla for the lil one and hubby got a spring mixed salad with pepino seeds. Hubby's salad with refreshing, my vegetarian taco with whole pinto beans was good but not worth raving, I could have made something like this at home. If you want chips and salsa, that's extra to buy. I hear the churros here are the bomb, must try next time."
744,"Tacubaya is my fourth street staple and something to always look forward to amid the challenge of looking for a parking spot! Great menu, affordable for the area, and super flavorful food! I did take out and ordered two crispy chicken tacos, one taco al pastor, and a pork tamal. The pastor was not overly greasy, it was crispy yet tender, and was delicious with the fresh tortilla and guacamole! The pork tamal really blew my mind--covered in a dark mole, the masa to pork ratio was perfect, and the pork was very flavorful. Will definitely go back for the tamal! If you are looking for quality Mexican with California freshness, go to Tacubaya! Casual, order at the counter, and good food!!!"
745,"2.5 -but the staff was super nice. Came here for lunch today. The place was hopping with business and there is plenty of room for seating . All staff was friendly, helpful and efficient and the establishment was very clean. We ordered chips and salsa, beef enchiladas and a tostada with sweet potatoes and chicken. The chips were thick and very hard and the salsa was just generic with little to no flavor. The enchilada was better, but again- lacked flavor. Nothing special about it. The tostada was not good and the meat was tough - although it had more flavor than the rest. I don't think I would come here again.  Meh..just OK."
746,"The battered & fried pollock, fish, $4.15,  and pork, $4 street tacos were delicious, perfectly cooked and served hot. My wife had a delicious made to order Chili Relleno $8.75. expensive but worth it."
747,"This was our first visit  The chicken enchiladas were delicious. The meat was moist, tender and flavorful even without the sauce. The enchilada sauce was the right consistency, flavorful and not salty. The steak on the taco was grilled and flavorful. I guess you can see that I use the word 'flavorful' three times already! Some places use too much salt to try to enhance the taste of the food, but they did not do that. I would come back in a flash. There's a free public parking lot next to the restaurant and metered parking on the street."
748,"Great casual eatery with tasty offerings. Thursday 7p.m. dinner time with plenty of folks enjoying their meals. Luckily, there was no line at the order counter. My friend suggested tortilla soup and horchata. She also got a torta and a carne asada taco. Nice rich flavored soup. I'll look forward to another visit when I'm hangry. I was still full from the buffet lunch at Galeto Brazilian Steakhouse in Oakland!  Staff were helpful and pleasant."
749,"I've been coming here for a few years, but this is my first time writing a review about this place. I work down the street from here and   a coworker of mine told me about it. The food here is pretty good, everything is made fresh. Especially their tortillas, I love the taste of fresh warm tortillas. It's so soft and delicious.I've gotten the ""papas con crema"" which is basically potato fritters with cheese inside of it and a drizzle of sour cream on top. That one is really good as well. But my most favorite that I always get is either the tuna ceviche or shrimp ceviche with fresh fried tortilla chips. I actually tried their fish tacos for the first time and I thought it was ok. I feel like it needs a little bit more flavor. It was sort of bland. And the aioli sauce didn't have much taste to it neither. I guess I was comparing it to Rubio's.Anyways the ambience is nice and clean. You could also watch them make your food because the kitchen is visible. My only problem with this place is I can never call in my order. I usually come here on my lunch break and it would make it so much better if I can call in my order so I can just be in and out and enjoy my lunch without feeling so rushed. But for some reason they never answer their phones. I understand that they can be busy sometimes but every time I've came on my lunch there's no line and I've asked them why weren't they answering their phones. Sometimes they say that they were  busy and it just died down or one time they didn't even know where the phone was at. It would be nice if I can just call in my order and just pick it up without having to wait. However the food has me coming back for more. I definitely recommend this place."
750,"I hardly write reviews but the service here has been poor consistently and not worth the price you pay.  An attitude of ""There will be someone behind you in line anyways"".  Avoid."
751,"Welp.  When you charge $9 for one Chile relleno, it better be amazing.  Meh food for omg this is life-changing prices loses you a few stars :("
752,"Ate dinner snack here. Chili relleno and chips and salsa. Tasted good. Decor after cinco de mayo. Self seating, order your items, get number, and they bring to your table. Parking on the street after 6pm free else 2 hours limit daytime."
753,"I've always had this love hate relationship with this place. I think it's because Richmond has cheap Mexican eats. This place is seated in the busy 4th Street strip in Berkeley. So I get it, it's shi-shi Mexican food, even though there's nothing in particular that sets it apart from the cheaper places, in my mind, except for location and handmade tortillas all the time. I've had fish tacos here, the crispy pollo tacos, the tortilla soup-- umm didn't like that. And the other day got one sopa de chorizo y papas. That's pretty yummy. I think the sopa shell was a lil crunchy for my liking. I'd rather have it be a lil denser. Also one sopa is $6.95. Yikes!And finally you gotta buy chips and salsa separately. Ya ya fine fine.The food's okay-- it's not spectacular. The line moves fast though, you're not going to wait an hour for a table, like at Bette's down the street."
754,The quality of food was not good. The cashier was very rude. I won't ever go here. Had soft and crispy taco. None was good. Enchilada with raw chicken. Guacamole not bad.
755,"Lengua is so so, kinda pricey for one taco. Tamal has good flavors, kinda salty though. The mole has a bit of a kick. The chips and salsa was salty and hard, wish it had other salsa to dip in. Location is in a nice spot, parking and what not. Food comes out super fast."
756,Underwhelming tacos for premium prices.  That might as well be the ad slogan.  Can't say the good was bad (though the chips were hard enough to worry about breaking a tooth).  But I can't say this was rewarding food either.  Just mostly flavorless meh.  Very disappointing.
757,"I was (probably delusional) optimist about this place off the 4th street shopping center for a quick-ish bite to eat. After standing in line for a good long while, we settled on tacos and enchiladas. Food looked good, prices are a bit much for how small the portions are (avoid the non-alcoholic drinks at all cost... they are crazy expensive which we learned the hard way). Waited a while for our food, and man... that was a disappointment. It didn't taste bad. It just tasted meh. The asada is meat, so I supposes it's not false advertising. But if anyone has ever had actually good carna asada... this is no where close. The enchiladas were better than the tacos, but still that's not saying much. We could have gotten the same tastes at an American ""Mexican"" chain restaurant. Won't be back. Bummer."
758,"I went here based on my sister's past visits and I was disappointed!  I decided to try something totally different and I had the sope.  It was awesome - a crispy corn cake with potatoes,  chorizo,  and black beans.  It doesn't look big but it is filling!  Now,  I'm on a, mission to find sopes in my neighborhood but I fear they may not be as good as Tacubayas!  Good job guys and thank you for introducing me to something new.  On a side note,  my sister also recommended the home made churros."
759,"Love this place. Every time we come here it's delicious. Wonderful service. So authentic. Chilaquiles is one of my favorites, menudo y friholes. Mmm"
760,"Tacubaya is a small Mexican restaurant located in an affluent area of Berkeley. Let me start with that I had a new person help me with the register and he not only forgot to give me utensils, my receipt and my number for the server to know where and who the order went to. But, I'm fair and not going to dock (much) a newbie or the restaurant for a new employee.I got the Torta Vegetariano, which was a vegetarian Torta with no cheese. It had a V next to it for Vegan but had cheese on it so I had to request it to be taken off. If you guys haven't heard I've covered to Vega so I no longer eat meat or fish (I never ate cheese).I also got a strawberry agua fresca and it was amazing! I loved the flavor and how fresh it tasted. I felt that they added sugar to it though, but overall it was delicious.The Torta was amazing, I added hella spice to it, but the bread and the vegetables were grilled to perfection. I definitely recommend stopping by and getting a bite to eat! The food came out quick and it was cheap as well.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me, I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."

It's so soft and delicious.I've gotten the ""papas con crema"" which is basically potato fritters with cheese inside of it and a drizzle of sour cream on top. That one is really good as well. But my most favorite that I always get is either the tuna ceviche or shrimp ceviche with fresh fried tortilla chips. I actually tried their fish tacos for the first time and I thought it was ok. I feel like it needs a little bit more flavor. It was sort of bland. And the aioli sauce didn't have much taste to it neither. I guess I was comparing it to Rubio's.Anyways the ambience is nice and clean. You could also watch them make your food because the kitchen is visible. My only problem with this place is I can never call in my order. I usually come here on my lunch break and it would make it so much better if I can call in my order so I can just be in and out and enjoy my lunch without feeling so rushed. But for some reason they never answer their phones. I understand that they can be busy sometimes but every time I've came on my lunch there's no line and I've asked them why weren't they answering their phones. Sometimes they say that they were  busy and it just died down or one time they didn't even know where the phone was at. It would be nice if I can just call in my order and just pick it up without having to wait. However the food has me coming back for more. I definitely recommend this place."
790,"I hardly write reviews but the service here has been poor consistently and not worth the price you pay.  An attitude of ""There will be someone behind you in line anyways"".  Avoid."
791,"Welp.  When you charge $9 for one Chile relleno, it better be amazing.  Meh food for omg this is life-changing prices loses you a few stars :("
792,"Ate dinner snack here. Chili relleno and chips and salsa. Tasted good. Decor after cinco de mayo. Self seating, order your items, get number, and they bring to your table. Parking on the street after 6pm free else 2 hours limit daytime."
793,"I've always had this love hate relationship with this place. I think it's because Richmond has cheap Mexican eats. This place is seated in the busy 4th Street strip in Berkeley. So I get it, it's shi-shi Mexican food, even though there's nothing in particular that sets it apart from the cheaper places, in my mind, except for location and handmade tortillas all the time. I've had fish tacos here, the crispy pollo tacos, the tortilla soup-- umm didn't like that. And the other day got one sopa de chorizo y papas. That's pretty yummy. I think the sopa shell was a lil crunchy for my liking. I'd rather have it be a lil denser. Also one sopa is $6.95. Yikes!And finally you gotta buy chips and salsa separately. Ya ya fine fine.The food's okay-- it's not spectacular. The line moves fast though, you're not going to wait an hour for a table, like at Bette's down the street."
794,The quality of food was not good. The cashier was very rude. I won't ever go here. Had soft and crispy taco. None was good. Enchilada with raw chicken. Guacamole not bad.
795,"Lengua is so so, kinda pricey for one taco. Tamal has good flavors, kinda salty though. The mole has a bit of a kick. The chips and salsa was salty and hard, wish it had other salsa to dip in. Location is in a nice spot, parking and what not. Food comes out super fast."
796,Underwhelming tacos for premium prices.  That might as well be the ad slogan.  Can't say the good was bad (though the chips were hard enough to worry about breaking a tooth).  But I can't say this was rewarding food either.  Just mostly flavorless meh.  Very disappointing.
797,"I was (probably delusional) optimist about this place off the 4th street shopping center for a quick-ish bite to eat. After standing in line for a good long while, we settled on tacos and enchiladas. Food looked good, prices are a bit much for how small the portions are (avoid the non-alcoholic drinks at all cost... they are crazy expensive which we learned the hard way). Waited a while for our food, and man... that was a disappointment. It didn't taste bad. It just tasted meh. The asada is meat, so I supposes it's not false advertising. But if anyone has ever had actually good carna asada... this is no where close. The enchiladas were better than the tacos, but still that's not saying much. We could have gotten the same tastes at an American ""Mexican"" chain restaurant. Won't be back. Bummer."
798,"I went here based on my sister's past visits and I was disappointed!  I decided to try something totally different and I had the sope.  It was awesome - a crispy corn cake with potatoes,  chorizo,  and black beans.  It doesn't look big but it is filling!  Now,  I'm on a, mission to find sopes in my neighborhood but I fear they may not be as good as Tacubayas!  Good job guys and thank you for introducing me to something new.  On a side note,  my sister also recommended the home made churros."

800,"Tacubaya is a small Mexican restaurant located in an affluent area of Berkeley. Let me start with that I had a new person help me with the register and he not only forgot to give me utensils, my receipt and my number for the server to know where and who the order went to. But, I'm fair and not going to dock (much) a newbie or the restaurant for a new employee.I got the Torta Vegetariano, which was a vegetarian Torta with no cheese. It had a V next to it for Vegan but had cheese on it so I had to request it to be taken off. If you guys haven't heard I've covered to Vega so I no longer eat meat or fish (I never ate cheese).I also got a strawberry agua fresca and it was amazing! I loved the flavor and how fresh it tasted. I felt that they added sugar to it though, but overall it was delicious.The Torta was amazing, I added hella spice to it, but the bread and the vegetables were grilled to perfection. I definitely recommend stopping by and getting a bite to eat! The food came out quick and it was cheap as well.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me, I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
801,"I loved my vegetarian whole bean taco!! Everything was perfectly fresh. I don't mind paying a bit more for fresh & home made corn tortillas made in front of you while you order... BONUS! It's a perfect place to eat for our little jaunts to Madewell, Lulu & Anthropologie in Berkeley. This is a stand in line , order, get a number & sit down cafe. They were quick & pleasant with their system. Our Modesto stand in line to order & sit w/a number for delivery should take note! My daughter ordered the chicken enchiladas.. they were beautiful and made w/homemade corn tortillas as well. My daughter found a rather large vein googly thing in her chicken and she asked what it was... they immediately offered to remake. Love that! But we were out of time, so we said no. Without even telling us, they took them off our tab and refunded us!! Whoa. Customers matter! They didn't have to do that, after all it was her 2nd enchilada.... def. will be back! And, the homemade quacamole w/ homemade tortilla chips made to order... yummmmy!!! Reminds me of Santa Barbara restaurants. :)"
802,"66% RATIO OF HAIR TO BITES!This place is generally okay.  It's a bit bland for Mexican food, but it's not awful and usually fresh and sanitary.  BUT .... yesterday I ordered a shrimp ceviche special and was about two bites in before my friend noticed a HAIR IN MY FOOD, glimmering in the afternoon sunlight.  Gross!  I looked at the line, and it was super crowded and started thinking ""Hmmm, maybe ONE HAIR won't kill me.""  So, against my better judgment (and in the midst of my friend silently judging my choice) and because I have worked in a restaurant before, I was going to let it go.Until I found a SECOND HAIR!  This hair was NOT lying on top, having blown over by the Berkeley wind.  It was clearly MIXED IN to the food!  So, that's too much, right - three bites and two hairs???  (For those counting, it's 66% of bites with hair.)So, I return it - fine they will take it off my bill.  SO HERE IS THE REALLY TERRIBLE PART - - - BEFORE ORDERING THE CEVICHE, i ASKED IF IT WAS ALREADY MADE, (because I would have liked to omit something), and they said YES, so NOT MADE TO ORDER.  I got it anyway.  The people ordering it after I returned the hairy mess also got it, and the people after them, and so on, and so on, because the kitchen DID NOT THROW IT OUT!Here's an interesting twist - none of the chefs working that day had hair that length so, I think the hair happened in prep, not that it matters but it wasn't the guys there to blame.  Would I like something else?  Again, against my better judgment I ask for a carne asada taco (for which I was charged - no apology taco?)  Anyway, underseasoned, boring asada, but edible and HAIRLESS, so bonus!  Seriously, if y'all ever go to Mexico City - it will kill this place for you.  Not worth the wait, the money, or the effort to locate random hairs.P.S. BUSSING MY OWN TABLE:I also had to go and get a shift towel and wipe down our table before we seated ourselves because the people working there only wipe one table down out of three, and ours was not the lucky winner (apparently hadn't been in several hours, given the dried salsas and such on it.)  So much for the tip I added to my card!"
803,"Stopped by here for a late lunch during the 4th street fair. This is the type of place where you order at the register and give you a number. There is outside and plenty of indoor seating. For food we ordered 2 vegetarian tacos, quesadilla for the lil one and hubby got a spring mixed salad with pepino seeds. Hubby's salad with refreshing, my vegetarian taco with whole pinto beans was good but not worth raving, I could have made something like this at home. If you want chips and salsa, that's extra to buy. I hear the churros here are the bomb, must try next time."
804,"Tacubaya is my fourth street staple and something to always look forward to amid the challenge of looking for a parking spot! Great menu, affordable for the area, and super flavorful food! I did take out and ordered two crispy chicken tacos, one taco al pastor, and a pork tamal. The pastor was not overly greasy, it was crispy yet tender, and was delicious with the fresh tortilla and guacamole! The pork tamal really blew my mind--covered in a dark mole, the masa to pork ratio was perfect, and the pork was very flavorful. Will definitely go back for the tamal! If you are looking for quality Mexican with California freshness, go to Tacubaya! Casual, order at the counter, and good food!!!"
805,"2.5 -but the staff was super nice. Came here for lunch today. The place was hopping with business and there is plenty of room for seating . All staff was friendly, helpful and efficient and the establishment was very clean. We ordered chips and salsa, beef enchiladas and a tostada with sweet potatoes and chicken. The chips were thick and very hard and the salsa was just generic with little to no flavor. The enchilada was better, but again- lacked flavor. Nothing special about it. The tostada was not good and the meat was tough - although it had more flavor than the rest. I don't think I would come here again.  Meh..just OK."
806,"The battered & fried pollock, fish, $4.15,  and pork, $4 street tacos were delicious, perfectly cooked and served hot. My wife had a delicious made to order Chili Relleno $8.75. expensive but worth it."
807,"This was our first visit  The chicken enchiladas were delicious. The meat was moist, tender and flavorful even without the sauce. The enchilada sauce was the right consistency, flavorful and not salty. The steak on the taco was grilled and flavorful. I guess you can see that I use the word 'flavorful' three times already! Some places use too much salt to try to enhance the taste of the food, but they did not do that. I would come back in a flash. There's a free public parking lot next to the restaurant and metered parking on the street."
808,"Great casual eatery with tasty offerings. Thursday 7p.m. dinner time with plenty of folks enjoying their meals. Luckily, there was no line at the order counter. My friend suggested tortilla soup and horchata. She also got a torta and a carne asada taco. Nice rich flavored soup. I'll look forward to another visit when I'm hangry. I was still full from the buffet lunch at Galeto Brazilian Steakhouse in Oakland!  Staff were helpful and pleasant."

The food came out quick and it was cheap as well.If anyone has any questions or concerns about this place, please feel free to contact me, I'll be happy to answer anything that comes my way."
841,"I loved my vegetarian whole bean taco!! Everything was perfectly fresh. I don't mind paying a bit more for fresh & home made corn tortillas made in front of you while you order... BONUS! It's a perfect place to eat for our little jaunts to Madewell, Lulu & Anthropologie in Berkeley. This is a stand in line , order, get a number & sit down cafe. They were quick & pleasant with their system. Our Modesto stand in line to order & sit w/a number for delivery should take note! My daughter ordered the chicken enchiladas.. they were beautiful and made w/homemade corn tortillas as well. My daughter found a rather large vein googly thing in her chicken and she asked what it was... they immediately offered to remake. Love that! But we were out of time, so we said no. Without even telling us, they took them off our tab and refunded us!! Whoa. Customers matter! They didn't have to do that, after all it was her 2nd enchilada.... def. will be back! And, the homemade quacamole w/ homemade tortilla chips made to order... yummmmy!!! Reminds me of Santa Barbara restaurants. :)"
842,"66% RATIO OF HAIR TO BITES!This place is generally okay.  It's a bit bland for Mexican food, but it's not awful and usually fresh and sanitary.  BUT .... yesterday I ordered a shrimp ceviche special and was about two bites in before my friend noticed a HAIR IN MY FOOD, glimmering in the afternoon sunlight.  Gross!  I looked at the line, and it was super crowded and started thinking ""Hmmm, maybe ONE HAIR won't kill me.""  So, against my better judgment (and in the midst of my friend silently judging my choice) and because I have worked in a restaurant before, I was going to let it go.Until I found a SECOND HAIR!  This hair was NOT lying on top, having blown over by the Berkeley wind.  It was clearly MIXED IN to the food!  So, that's too much, right - three bites and two hairs???  (For those counting, it's 66% of bites with hair.)So, I return it - fine they will take it off my bill.  SO HERE IS THE REALLY TERRIBLE PART - - - BEFORE ORDERING THE CEVICHE, i ASKED IF IT WAS ALREADY MADE, (because I would have liked to omit something), and they said YES, so NOT MADE TO ORDER.  I got it anyway.  The people ordering it after I returned the hairy mess also got it, and the people after them, and so on, and so on, because the kitchen DID NOT THROW IT OUT!Here's an interesting twist - none of the chefs working that day had hair that length so, I think the hair happened in prep, not that it matters but it wasn't the guys there to blame.  Would I like something else?  Again, against my better judgment I ask for a carne asada taco (for which I was charged - no apology taco?)  Anyway, underseasoned, boring asada, but edible and HAIRLESS, so bonus!  Seriously, if y'all ever go to Mexico City - it will kill this place for you.  Not worth the wait, the money, or the effort to locate random hairs.P.S. BUSSING MY OWN TABLE:I also had to go and get a shift towel and wipe down our table before we seated ourselves because the people working there only wipe one table down out of three, and ours was not the lucky winner (apparently hadn't been in several hours, given the dried salsas and such on it.)  So much for the tip I added to my card!"
843,"Stopped by here for a late lunch during the 4th street fair. This is the type of place where you order at the register and give you a number. There is outside and plenty of indoor seating. For food we ordered 2 vegetarian tacos, quesadilla for the lil one and hubby got a spring mixed salad with pepino seeds. Hubby's salad with refreshing, my vegetarian taco with whole pinto beans was good but not worth raving, I could have made something like this at home. If you want chips and salsa, that's extra to buy. I hear the churros here are the bomb, must try next time."
844,"Tacubaya is my fourth street staple and something to always look forward to amid the challenge of looking for a parking spot! Great menu, affordable for the area, and super flavorful food! I did take out and ordered two crispy chicken tacos, one taco al pastor, and a pork tamal. The pastor was not overly greasy, it was crispy yet tender, and was delicious with the fresh tortilla and guacamole! The pork tamal really blew my mind--covered in a dark mole, the masa to pork ratio was perfect, and the pork was very flavorful. Will definitely go back for the tamal! If you are looking for quality Mexican with California freshness, go to Tacubaya! Casual, order at the counter, and good food!!!"
845,"2.5 -but the staff was super nice. Came here for lunch today. The place was hopping with business and there is plenty of room for seating . All staff was friendly, helpful and efficient and the establishment was very clean. We ordered chips and salsa, beef enchiladas and a tostada with sweet potatoes and chicken. The chips were thick and very hard and the salsa was just generic with little to no flavor. The enchilada was better, but again- lacked flavor. Nothing special about it. The tostada was not good and the meat was tough - although it had more flavor than the rest. I don't think I would come here again.  Meh..just OK."
846,"The battered & fried pollock, fish, $4.15,  and pork, $4 street tacos were delicious, perfectly cooked and served hot. My wife had a delicious made to order Chili Relleno $8.75. expensive but worth it."
847,"This was our first visit  The chicken enchiladas were delicious. The meat was moist, tender and flavorful even without the sauce. The enchilada sauce was the right consistency, flavorful and not salty. The steak on the taco was grilled and flavorful. I guess you can see that I use the word 'flavorful' three times already! Some places use too much salt to try to enhance the taste of the food, but they did not do that. I would come back in a flash. There's a free public parking lot next to the restaurant and metered parking on the street."
848,"Great casual eatery with tasty offerings. Thursday 7p.m. dinner time with plenty of folks enjoying their meals. Luckily, there was no line at the order counter. My friend suggested tortilla soup and horchata. She also got a torta and a carne asada taco. Nice rich flavored soup. I'll look forward to another visit when I'm hangry. I was still full from the buffet lunch at Galeto Brazilian Steakhouse in Oakland!  Staff were helpful and pleasant."
849,"I've been coming here for a few years, but this is my first time writing a review about this place. I work down the street from here and   a coworker of mine told me about it. The food here is pretty good, everything is made fresh. Especially their tortillas, I love the taste of fresh warm tortillas. It's so soft and delicious.I've gotten the ""papas con crema"" which is basically potato fritters with cheese inside of it and a drizzle of sour cream on top. That one is really good as well. But my most favorite that I always get is either the tuna ceviche or shrimp ceviche with fresh fried tortilla chips. I actually tried their fish tacos for the first time and I thought it was ok. I feel like it needs a little bit more flavor. It was sort of bland. And the aioli sauce didn't have much taste to it neither. I guess I was comparing it to Rubio's.Anyways the ambience is nice and clean. You could also watch them make your food because the kitchen is visible. My only problem with this place is I can never call in my order. I usually come here on my lunch break and it would make it so much better if I can call in my order so I can just be in and out and enjoy my lunch without feeling so rushed. But for some reason they never answer their phones. I understand that they can be busy sometimes but every time I've came on my lunch there's no line and I've asked them why weren't they answering their phones. Sometimes they say that they were  busy and it just died down or one time they didn't even know where the phone was at. It would be nice if I can just call in my order and just pick it up without having to wait. However the food has me coming back for more. I definitely recommend this place."
850,"I hardly write reviews but the service here has been poor consistently and not worth the price you pay.  An attitude of ""There will be someone behind you in line anyways"".  Avoid."
851,"Welp.  When you charge $9 for one Chile relleno, it better be amazing.  Meh food for omg this is life-changing prices loses you a few stars :("
852,"Ate dinner snack here. Chili relleno and chips and salsa. Tasted good. Decor after cinco de mayo. Self seating, order your items, get number, and they bring to your table. Parking on the street after 6pm free else 2 hours limit daytime."
853,"I've always had this love hate relationship with this place. I think it's because Richmond has cheap Mexican eats. This place is seated in the busy 4th Street strip in Berkeley. So I get it, it's shi-shi Mexican food, even though there's nothing in particular that sets it apart from the cheaper places, in my mind, except for location and handmade tortillas all the time. I've had fish tacos here, the crispy pollo tacos, the tortilla soup-- umm didn't like that. And the other day got one sopa de chorizo y papas. That's pretty yummy. I think the sopa shell was a lil crunchy for my liking. I'd rather have it be a lil denser. Also one sopa is $6.95. Yikes!And finally you gotta buy chips and salsa separately. Ya ya fine fine.The food's okay-- it's not spectacular. The line moves fast though, you're not going to wait an hour for a table, like at Bette's down the street."
854,The quality of food was not good. The cashier was very rude. I won't ever go here. Had soft and crispy taco. None was good. Enchilada with raw chicken. Guacamole not bad.
855,"Lengua is so so, kinda pricey for one taco. Tamal has good flavors, kinda salty though. The mole has a bit of a kick. The chips and salsa was salty and hard, wish it had other salsa to dip in. Location is in a nice spot, parking and what not. Food comes out super fast."
856,Underwhelming tacos for premium prices.  That might as well be the ad slogan.  Can't say the good was bad (though the chips were hard enough to worry about breaking a tooth).  But I can't say this was rewarding food either.  Just mostly flavorless meh.  Very disappointing.
857,"I was (probably delusional) optimist about this place off the 4th street shopping center for a quick-ish bite to eat. After standing in line for a good long while, we settled on tacos and enchiladas. Food looked good, prices are a bit much for how small the portions are (avoid the non-alcoholic drinks at all cost... they are crazy expensive which we learned the hard way). Waited a while for our food, and man... that was a disappointment. It didn't taste bad. It just tasted meh. The asada is meat, so I supposes it's not false advertising. But if anyone has ever had actually good carna asada... this is no where close. The enchiladas were better than the tacos, but still that's not saying much. We could have gotten the same tastes at an American ""Mexican"" chain restaurant. Won't be back. Bummer."
858,"I went here based on my sister's past visits and I was disappointed!  I decided to try something totally different and I had the sope.  It was awesome - a crispy corn cake with potatoes,  chorizo,  and black beans.  It doesn't look big but it is filling!  Now,  I'm on a, mission to find sopes in my neighborhood but I fear they may not be as good as Tacubayas!  Good job guys and thank you for introducing me to something new.  On a side note,  my sister also recommended the home made churros."
859,"Love this place. Every time we come here it's delicious. Wonderful service. So authentic. Chilaquiles is one of my favorites, menudo y friholes. Mmm"
