They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."
1,"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 because of our missing food.My favorite food in the world is probably Japanese food. I loveeeeee Japanese tapas and sushi! However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...Ordered:x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."
2,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant. So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."
3,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"
4,"If you are looking for family-style Izakaya type of places in Berkeley, then you could not miss out Kiraku. If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."
5,"A lovely traditional Japanese tapa Cafe is what you'll find here. Dishes are full of flavor.  Tapas vary from pork belly, scallops to delicious varieties of fish. I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside. Customer service is excellent. waitresses are very pleasant and friendly"
6,"One of the few places for Izakaya in Berkeley! The wait varies for dinner; I've waited 15 minutes on an occasion and 45 minutes on another. It's a cute, cozy place for a date. Kiraku has an authentic Japanese vibe and the food is presented nicely. Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
7,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
8,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup. So cuteAmbiance: small place that can get pretty loudService: not bad You HAVE to try this place if you are in Berkeley! And remember to make reservation or get there 15 min early before they open on weekday
9,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
10,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food. My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
11,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult. The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them. All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
12,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting. Like I mentioned earlier, we came as a group of 5, but I feel like this restaurant is better for small groups such as a group of 2 or 3. I will most likely come back for a date!"
13,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
14,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
15,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
16,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
17,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
18,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"
19,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"

I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside. Customer service is excellent. waitresses are very pleasant and friendly"
26,"One of the few places for Izakaya in Berkeley! The wait varies for dinner; I've waited 15 minutes on an occasion and 45 minutes on another. It's a cute, cozy place for a date. Kiraku has an authentic Japanese vibe and the food is presented nicely. Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
27,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
28,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup. So cuteAmbiance: small place that can get pretty loudService: not bad You HAVE to try this place if you are in Berkeley! And remember to make reservation or get there 15 min early before they open on weekday
29,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
30,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food. My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
31,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult. The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them. All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
32,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting. Like I mentioned earlier, we came as a group of 5, but I feel like this restaurant is better for small groups such as a group of 2 or 3. I will most likely come back for a date!"
33,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
34,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
35,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
36,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
37,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
38,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"
39,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
40,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good. Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."
41,"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 because of our missing food.My favorite food in the world is probably Japanese food. I loveeeeee Japanese tapas and sushi! However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...Ordered:x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."
42,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant. So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."
43,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"
44,"If you are looking for family-style Izakaya type of places in Berkeley, then you could not miss out Kiraku. If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."

53,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
54,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
55,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
56,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
57,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
58,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"
59,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
60,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good. Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."
61,"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 because of our missing food.My favorite food in the world is probably Japanese food. I loveeeeee Japanese tapas and sushi! However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...Ordered:x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."
62,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant. So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."
63,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"
64,"If you are looking for family-style Izakaya type of places in Berkeley, then you could not miss out Kiraku. If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."
65,"A lovely traditional Japanese tapa Cafe is what you'll find here. Dishes are full of flavor.  Tapas vary from pork belly, scallops to delicious varieties of fish. I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside. Customer service is excellent. waitresses are very pleasant and friendly"
66,"One of the few places for Izakaya in Berkeley! The wait varies for dinner; I've waited 15 minutes on an occasion and 45 minutes on another. It's a cute, cozy place for a date. Kiraku has an authentic Japanese vibe and the food is presented nicely. Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
67,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
68,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup. So cuteAmbiance: small place that can get pretty loudService: not bad You HAVE to try this place if you are in Berkeley! And remember to make reservation or get there 15 min early before they open on weekday
69,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
70,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food. My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
71,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult. The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them. All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
72,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting.

But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."
83,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"
84,"If you are looking for family-style Izakaya type of places in Berkeley, then you could not miss out Kiraku. If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."
85,"A lovely traditional Japanese tapa Cafe is what you'll find here. Dishes are full of flavor.  Tapas vary from pork belly, scallops to delicious varieties of fish. I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside. Customer service is excellent. waitresses are very pleasant and friendly"
86,"One of the few places for Izakaya in Berkeley! The wait varies for dinner; I've waited 15 minutes on an occasion and 45 minutes on another. It's a cute, cozy place for a date. Kiraku has an authentic Japanese vibe and the food is presented nicely. Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
87,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
88,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup. So cuteAmbiance: small place that can get pretty loudService: not bad You HAVE to try this place if you are in Berkeley! And remember to make reservation or get there 15 min early before they open on weekday
89,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
90,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food. My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
91,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult. The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them. All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
92,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting. Like I mentioned earlier, we came as a group of 5, but I feel like this restaurant is better for small groups such as a group of 2 or 3. I will most likely come back for a date!"
93,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
94,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
95,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
96,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
97,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
98,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"
99,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
100,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good. Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."
101,"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 because of our missing food.My favorite food in the world is probably Japanese food. I loveeeeee Japanese tapas and sushi! However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...Ordered:x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."

109,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
110,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food. My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
111,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult. The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them. All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
112,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting. Like I mentioned earlier, we came as a group of 5, but I feel like this restaurant is better for small groups such as a group of 2 or 3. I will most likely come back for a date!"
113,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
114,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
115,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
116,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
117,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
118,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"
119,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
120,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good. Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."
121,"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 because of our missing food.My favorite food in the world is probably Japanese food. I loveeeeee Japanese tapas and sushi! However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...Ordered:x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."
122,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant. So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."
123,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"
124,"If you are looking for family-style Izakaya type of places in Berkeley, then you could not miss out Kiraku. If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."
125,"A lovely traditional Japanese tapa Cafe is what you'll find here. Dishes are full of flavor.  Tapas vary from pork belly, scallops to delicious varieties of fish. I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside. Customer service is excellent. waitresses are very pleasant and friendly"
126,"One of the few places for Izakaya in Berkeley! The wait varies for dinner; I've waited 15 minutes on an occasion and 45 minutes on another. It's a cute, cozy place for a date. Kiraku has an authentic Japanese vibe and the food is presented nicely. Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
127,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
128,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup.

The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
137,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
138,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"
139,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
140,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good. Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."
141,"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 because of our missing food.My favorite food in the world is probably Japanese food. I loveeeeee Japanese tapas and sushi! However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...Ordered:x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."
142,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant. So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."
143,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"
144,"If you are looking for family-style Izakaya type of places in Berkeley, then you could not miss out Kiraku. If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."
145,"A lovely traditional Japanese tapa Cafe is what you'll find here. Dishes are full of flavor.  Tapas vary from pork belly, scallops to delicious varieties of fish. I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside. Customer service is excellent. waitresses are very pleasant and friendly"
146,"One of the few places for Izakaya in Berkeley! The wait varies for dinner; I've waited 15 minutes on an occasion and 45 minutes on another. It's a cute, cozy place for a date. Kiraku has an authentic Japanese vibe and the food is presented nicely. Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
147,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
148,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup. So cuteAmbiance: small place that can get pretty loudService: not bad You HAVE to try this place if you are in Berkeley! And remember to make reservation or get there 15 min early before they open on weekday
149,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
150,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food. My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
151,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult. The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them. All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
152,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting. Like I mentioned earlier, we came as a group of 5, but I feel like this restaurant is better for small groups such as a group of 2 or 3. I will most likely come back for a date!"
153,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
154,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
155,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
156,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait.

Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."
163,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"
164,"If you are looking for family-style Izakaya type of places in Berkeley, then you could not miss out Kiraku. If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."
165,"A lovely traditional Japanese tapa Cafe is what you'll find here. Dishes are full of flavor.  Tapas vary from pork belly, scallops to delicious varieties of fish. I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside. Customer service is excellent. waitresses are very pleasant and friendly"
166,"One of the few places for Izakaya in Berkeley! The wait varies for dinner; I've waited 15 minutes on an occasion and 45 minutes on another. It's a cute, cozy place for a date. Kiraku has an authentic Japanese vibe and the food is presented nicely. Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
167,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
168,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup. So cuteAmbiance: small place that can get pretty loudService: not bad You HAVE to try this place if you are in Berkeley! And remember to make reservation or get there 15 min early before they open on weekday
169,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
170,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food. My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
171,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult. The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them. All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
172,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting. Like I mentioned earlier, we came as a group of 5, but I feel like this restaurant is better for small groups such as a group of 2 or 3. I will most likely come back for a date!"
173,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
174,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
175,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
176,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
177,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
178,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"
179,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
180,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good. Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."
181,"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 because of our missing food.My favorite food in the world is probably Japanese food. I loveeeeee Japanese tapas and sushi! However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...Ordered:x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."
182,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant. So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."

My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
191,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult. The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them. All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
192,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting. Like I mentioned earlier, we came as a group of 5, but I feel like this restaurant is better for small groups such as a group of 2 or 3. I will most likely come back for a date!"
193,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
194,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
195,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
196,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
197,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
198,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"
199,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
200,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good. Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."
201,"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 because of our missing food.My favorite food in the world is probably Japanese food. I loveeeeee Japanese tapas and sushi! However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...Ordered:x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."
202,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant. So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."
203,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"
204,"If you are looking for family-style Izakaya type of places in Berkeley, then you could not miss out Kiraku. If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."
205,"A lovely traditional Japanese tapa Cafe is what you'll find here. Dishes are full of flavor.  Tapas vary from pork belly, scallops to delicious varieties of fish. I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside. Customer service is excellent. waitresses are very pleasant and friendly"
206,"One of the few places for Izakaya in Berkeley! The wait varies for dinner; I've waited 15 minutes on an occasion and 45 minutes on another. It's a cute, cozy place for a date. Kiraku has an authentic Japanese vibe and the food is presented nicely. Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
207,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
208,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup. So cuteAmbiance: small place that can get pretty loudService: not bad You HAVE to try this place if you are in Berkeley! And remember to make reservation or get there 15 min early before they open on weekday
209,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
210,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku!

219,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
220,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good. Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."
221,"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 because of our missing food.My favorite food in the world is probably Japanese food. I loveeeeee Japanese tapas and sushi! However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...Ordered:x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."
222,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant. So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."
223,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"
224,"If you are looking for family-style Izakaya type of places in Berkeley, then you could not miss out Kiraku. If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."
225,"A lovely traditional Japanese tapa Cafe is what you'll find here. Dishes are full of flavor.  Tapas vary from pork belly, scallops to delicious varieties of fish. I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside. Customer service is excellent. waitresses are very pleasant and friendly"
226,"One of the few places for Izakaya in Berkeley! The wait varies for dinner; I've waited 15 minutes on an occasion and 45 minutes on another. It's a cute, cozy place for a date. Kiraku has an authentic Japanese vibe and the food is presented nicely. Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
227,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
228,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup. So cuteAmbiance: small place that can get pretty loudService: not bad You HAVE to try this place if you are in Berkeley! And remember to make reservation or get there 15 min early before they open on weekday
229,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
230,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food. My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
231,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult. The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them. All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
232,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting. Like I mentioned earlier, we came as a group of 5, but I feel like this restaurant is better for small groups such as a group of 2 or 3. I will most likely come back for a date!"
233,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
234,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
235,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
236,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
237,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"

The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"
244,"If you are looking for family-style Izakaya type of places in Berkeley, then you could not miss out Kiraku. If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."
245,"A lovely traditional Japanese tapa Cafe is what you'll find here. Dishes are full of flavor.  Tapas vary from pork belly, scallops to delicious varieties of fish. I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside. Customer service is excellent. waitresses are very pleasant and friendly"
246,"One of the few places for Izakaya in Berkeley! The wait varies for dinner; I've waited 15 minutes on an occasion and 45 minutes on another. It's a cute, cozy place for a date. Kiraku has an authentic Japanese vibe and the food is presented nicely. Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
247,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
248,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup. So cuteAmbiance: small place that can get pretty loudService: not bad You HAVE to try this place if you are in Berkeley! And remember to make reservation or get there 15 min early before they open on weekday
249,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
250,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food. My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
251,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult. The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them. All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
252,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting. Like I mentioned earlier, we came as a group of 5, but I feel like this restaurant is better for small groups such as a group of 2 or 3. I will most likely come back for a date!"
253,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
254,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
255,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
256,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
257,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
258,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"
259,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
260,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good. Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."
261,"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 because of our missing food.My favorite food in the world is probably Japanese food. I loveeeeee Japanese tapas and sushi! However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...Ordered:x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."
262,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant. So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."
263,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting.

We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
271,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult. The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them. All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
272,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting. Like I mentioned earlier, we came as a group of 5, but I feel like this restaurant is better for small groups such as a group of 2 or 3. I will most likely come back for a date!"
273,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
274,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
275,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
276,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
277,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
278,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"
279,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
280,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good. Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."
281,"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 because of our missing food.My favorite food in the world is probably Japanese food. I loveeeeee Japanese tapas and sushi! However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...Ordered:x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."
282,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant. So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."
283,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"
284,"If you are looking for family-style Izakaya type of places in Berkeley, then you could not miss out Kiraku. If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."
285,"A lovely traditional Japanese tapa Cafe is what you'll find here. Dishes are full of flavor.  Tapas vary from pork belly, scallops to delicious varieties of fish. I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside. Customer service is excellent. waitresses are very pleasant and friendly"
286,"One of the few places for Izakaya in Berkeley! The wait varies for dinner; I've waited 15 minutes on an occasion and 45 minutes on another. It's a cute, cozy place for a date. Kiraku has an authentic Japanese vibe and the food is presented nicely. Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
287,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
288,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup. So cuteAmbiance: small place that can get pretty loudService: not bad You HAVE to try this place if you are in Berkeley! And remember to make reservation or get there 15 min early before they open on weekday
289,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
290,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food. My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them.

If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
300,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good. Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."
301,"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 because of our missing food.My favorite food in the world is probably Japanese food. I loveeeeee Japanese tapas and sushi! However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...Ordered:x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."
302,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant. So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."
303,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"
304,"If you are looking for family-style Izakaya type of places in Berkeley, then you could not miss out Kiraku. If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."
305,"A lovely traditional Japanese tapa Cafe is what you'll find here. Dishes are full of flavor.  Tapas vary from pork belly, scallops to delicious varieties of fish. I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside. Customer service is excellent. waitresses are very pleasant and friendly"
306,"One of the few places for Izakaya in Berkeley! The wait varies for dinner; I've waited 15 minutes on an occasion and 45 minutes on another. It's a cute, cozy place for a date. Kiraku has an authentic Japanese vibe and the food is presented nicely. Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
307,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
308,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup. So cuteAmbiance: small place that can get pretty loudService: not bad You HAVE to try this place if you are in Berkeley! And remember to make reservation or get there 15 min early before they open on weekday
309,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
310,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food. My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
311,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult. The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them. All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
312,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting. Like I mentioned earlier, we came as a group of 5, but I feel like this restaurant is better for small groups such as a group of 2 or 3. I will most likely come back for a date!"
313,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
314,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
315,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
316,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
317,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
318,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"
319,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love?

If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."
325,"A lovely traditional Japanese tapa Cafe is what you'll find here. Dishes are full of flavor.  Tapas vary from pork belly, scallops to delicious varieties of fish. I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside. Customer service is excellent. waitresses are very pleasant and friendly"
326,"One of the few places for Izakaya in Berkeley! The wait varies for dinner; I've waited 15 minutes on an occasion and 45 minutes on another. It's a cute, cozy place for a date. Kiraku has an authentic Japanese vibe and the food is presented nicely. Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
327,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
328,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup. So cuteAmbiance: small place that can get pretty loudService: not bad You HAVE to try this place if you are in Berkeley! And remember to make reservation or get there 15 min early before they open on weekday
329,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
330,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food. My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
331,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult. The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them. All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
332,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting. Like I mentioned earlier, we came as a group of 5, but I feel like this restaurant is better for small groups such as a group of 2 or 3. I will most likely come back for a date!"
333,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
334,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
335,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
336,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
337,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
338,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"
339,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
340,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good. Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."
341,"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 because of our missing food.My favorite food in the world is probably Japanese food. I loveeeeee Japanese tapas and sushi! However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...Ordered:x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."
342,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant. So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."
343,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"

All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
352,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting. Like I mentioned earlier, we came as a group of 5, but I feel like this restaurant is better for small groups such as a group of 2 or 3. I will most likely come back for a date!"
353,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
354,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
355,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
356,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
357,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
358,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"
359,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
360,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good. Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."
361,"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 because of our missing food.My favorite food in the world is probably Japanese food. I loveeeeee Japanese tapas and sushi! However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...Ordered:x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."
362,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant. So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."
363,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"
364,"If you are looking for family-style Izakaya type of places in Berkeley, then you could not miss out Kiraku. If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."
365,"A lovely traditional Japanese tapa Cafe is what you'll find here. Dishes are full of flavor.  Tapas vary from pork belly, scallops to delicious varieties of fish. I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside. Customer service is excellent. waitresses are very pleasant and friendly"
366,"One of the few places for Izakaya in Berkeley! The wait varies for dinner; I've waited 15 minutes on an occasion and 45 minutes on another. It's a cute, cozy place for a date. Kiraku has an authentic Japanese vibe and the food is presented nicely. Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
367,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
368,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup. So cuteAmbiance: small place that can get pretty loudService: not bad You HAVE to try this place if you are in Berkeley! And remember to make reservation or get there 15 min early before they open on weekday
369,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
370,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food. My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
371,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult. The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them.

I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."
382,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant. So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."
383,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"
384,"If you are looking for family-style Izakaya type of places in Berkeley, then you could not miss out Kiraku. If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."
385,"A lovely traditional Japanese tapa Cafe is what you'll find here. Dishes are full of flavor.  Tapas vary from pork belly, scallops to delicious varieties of fish. I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside. Customer service is excellent. waitresses are very pleasant and friendly"
386,"One of the few places for Izakaya in Berkeley! The wait varies for dinner; I've waited 15 minutes on an occasion and 45 minutes on another. It's a cute, cozy place for a date. Kiraku has an authentic Japanese vibe and the food is presented nicely. Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
387,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
388,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup. So cuteAmbiance: small place that can get pretty loudService: not bad You HAVE to try this place if you are in Berkeley! And remember to make reservation or get there 15 min early before they open on weekday
389,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
390,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food. My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
391,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult. The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them. All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
392,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting. Like I mentioned earlier, we came as a group of 5, but I feel like this restaurant is better for small groups such as a group of 2 or 3. I will most likely come back for a date!"
393,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
394,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
395,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
396,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
397,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
398,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"
399,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
400,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good. Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."

Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
407,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
408,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup. So cuteAmbiance: small place that can get pretty loudService: not bad You HAVE to try this place if you are in Berkeley! And remember to make reservation or get there 15 min early before they open on weekday
409,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
410,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food. My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
411,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult. The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them. All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
412,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting. Like I mentioned earlier, we came as a group of 5, but I feel like this restaurant is better for small groups such as a group of 2 or 3. I will most likely come back for a date!"
413,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
414,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
415,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
416,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
417,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
418,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"
419,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
420,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good. Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."
421,"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 because of our missing food.My favorite food in the world is probably Japanese food. I loveeeeee Japanese tapas and sushi! However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...Ordered:x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."
422,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant. So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."
423,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"
424,"If you are looking for family-style Izakaya type of places in Berkeley, then you could not miss out Kiraku. If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."
425,"A lovely traditional Japanese tapa Cafe is what you'll find here. Dishes are full of flavor.  Tapas vary from pork belly, scallops to delicious varieties of fish. I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside. Customer service is excellent. waitresses are very pleasant and friendly"

Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
434,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
435,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
436,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
437,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
438,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"
439,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
440,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good. Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."
441,"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 because of our missing food.My favorite food in the world is probably Japanese food. I loveeeeee Japanese tapas and sushi! However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...Ordered:x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."
442,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant. So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."
443,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"
444,"If you are looking for family-style Izakaya type of places in Berkeley, then you could not miss out Kiraku. If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."
445,"A lovely traditional Japanese tapa Cafe is what you'll find here. Dishes are full of flavor.  Tapas vary from pork belly, scallops to delicious varieties of fish. I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside. Customer service is excellent. waitresses are very pleasant and friendly"
446,"One of the few places for Izakaya in Berkeley! The wait varies for dinner; I've waited 15 minutes on an occasion and 45 minutes on another. It's a cute, cozy place for a date. Kiraku has an authentic Japanese vibe and the food is presented nicely. Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
447,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
448,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup. So cuteAmbiance: small place that can get pretty loudService: not bad You HAVE to try this place if you are in Berkeley! And remember to make reservation or get there 15 min early before they open on weekday
449,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
450,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food. My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
451,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult. The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them. All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
452,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting. Like I mentioned earlier, we came as a group of 5, but I feel like this restaurant is better for small groups such as a group of 2 or 3. I will most likely come back for a date!"
453,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English.

I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."
463,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"
464,"If you are looking for family-style Izakaya type of places in Berkeley, then you could not miss out Kiraku. If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."
465,"A lovely traditional Japanese tapa Cafe is what you'll find here. Dishes are full of flavor.  Tapas vary from pork belly, scallops to delicious varieties of fish. I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside. Customer service is excellent. waitresses are very pleasant and friendly"
466,"One of the few places for Izakaya in Berkeley! The wait varies for dinner; I've waited 15 minutes on an occasion and 45 minutes on another. It's a cute, cozy place for a date. Kiraku has an authentic Japanese vibe and the food is presented nicely. Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
467,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
468,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup. So cuteAmbiance: small place that can get pretty loudService: not bad You HAVE to try this place if you are in Berkeley! And remember to make reservation or get there 15 min early before they open on weekday
469,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
470,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food. My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
471,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult. The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them. All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
472,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting. Like I mentioned earlier, we came as a group of 5, but I feel like this restaurant is better for small groups such as a group of 2 or 3. I will most likely come back for a date!"
473,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
474,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
475,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
476,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
477,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
478,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"
479,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
480,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good. Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."
481,"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 because of our missing food.My favorite food in the world is probably Japanese food. I loveeeeee Japanese tapas and sushi! However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...Ordered:x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."
482,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant. So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat.

489,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
490,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food. My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
491,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult. The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them. All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
492,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting. Like I mentioned earlier, we came as a group of 5, but I feel like this restaurant is better for small groups such as a group of 2 or 3. I will most likely come back for a date!"
493,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
494,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
495,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
496,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
497,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
498,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"
499,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
500,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good. Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."
501,"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 because of our missing food.My favorite food in the world is probably Japanese food. I loveeeeee Japanese tapas and sushi! However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...Ordered:x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."
502,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant. So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."
503,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"
504,"If you are looking for family-style Izakaya type of places in Berkeley, then you could not miss out Kiraku. If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."
505,"A lovely traditional Japanese tapa Cafe is what you'll find here. Dishes are full of flavor.  Tapas vary from pork belly, scallops to delicious varieties of fish. I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside. Customer service is excellent. waitresses are very pleasant and friendly"
506,"One of the few places for Izakaya in Berkeley! The wait varies for dinner; I've waited 15 minutes on an occasion and 45 minutes on another. It's a cute, cozy place for a date. Kiraku has an authentic Japanese vibe and the food is presented nicely. Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
507,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
508,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup.

Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
517,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
518,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"
519,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
520,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good. Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."
521,"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 because of our missing food.My favorite food in the world is probably Japanese food. I loveeeeee Japanese tapas and sushi! However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...Ordered:x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."
522,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant. So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."
523,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"
524,"If you are looking for family-style Izakaya type of places in Berkeley, then you could not miss out Kiraku. If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."
525,"A lovely traditional Japanese tapa Cafe is what you'll find here. Dishes are full of flavor.  Tapas vary from pork belly, scallops to delicious varieties of fish. I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside. Customer service is excellent. waitresses are very pleasant and friendly"
526,"One of the few places for Izakaya in Berkeley! The wait varies for dinner; I've waited 15 minutes on an occasion and 45 minutes on another. It's a cute, cozy place for a date. Kiraku has an authentic Japanese vibe and the food is presented nicely. Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
527,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
528,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup. So cuteAmbiance: small place that can get pretty loudService: not bad You HAVE to try this place if you are in Berkeley! And remember to make reservation or get there 15 min early before they open on weekday
529,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
530,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food. My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
531,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult. The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them. All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
532,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting. Like I mentioned earlier, we came as a group of 5, but I feel like this restaurant is better for small groups such as a group of 2 or 3. I will most likely come back for a date!"
533,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
534,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
535,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
536,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious.

543,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"
544,"If you are looking for family-style Izakaya type of places in Berkeley, then you could not miss out Kiraku. If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."
545,"A lovely traditional Japanese tapa Cafe is what you'll find here. Dishes are full of flavor.  Tapas vary from pork belly, scallops to delicious varieties of fish. I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside. Customer service is excellent. waitresses are very pleasant and friendly"
546,"One of the few places for Izakaya in Berkeley! The wait varies for dinner; I've waited 15 minutes on an occasion and 45 minutes on another. It's a cute, cozy place for a date. Kiraku has an authentic Japanese vibe and the food is presented nicely. Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
547,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
548,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup. So cuteAmbiance: small place that can get pretty loudService: not bad You HAVE to try this place if you are in Berkeley! And remember to make reservation or get there 15 min early before they open on weekday
549,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
550,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food. My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
551,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult. The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them. All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
552,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting. Like I mentioned earlier, we came as a group of 5, but I feel like this restaurant is better for small groups such as a group of 2 or 3. I will most likely come back for a date!"
553,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
554,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
555,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
556,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
557,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
558,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"
559,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
560,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good. Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."
561,"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 because of our missing food.My favorite food in the world is probably Japanese food. I loveeeeee Japanese tapas and sushi! However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...Ordered:x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."
562,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant. So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."

We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
571,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult. The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them. All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
572,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting. Like I mentioned earlier, we came as a group of 5, but I feel like this restaurant is better for small groups such as a group of 2 or 3. I will most likely come back for a date!"
573,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
574,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
575,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
576,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
577,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
578,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"
579,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
580,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good. Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."
581,"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 because of our missing food.My favorite food in the world is probably Japanese food. I loveeeeee Japanese tapas and sushi! However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...Ordered:x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."
582,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant. So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."
583,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"
584,"If you are looking for family-style Izakaya type of places in Berkeley, then you could not miss out Kiraku. If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."
585,"A lovely traditional Japanese tapa Cafe is what you'll find here. Dishes are full of flavor.  Tapas vary from pork belly, scallops to delicious varieties of fish. I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside. Customer service is excellent. waitresses are very pleasant and friendly"
586,"One of the few places for Izakaya in Berkeley! The wait varies for dinner; I've waited 15 minutes on an occasion and 45 minutes on another. It's a cute, cozy place for a date. Kiraku has an authentic Japanese vibe and the food is presented nicely. Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
587,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
588,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup. So cuteAmbiance: small place that can get pretty loudService: not bad You HAVE to try this place if you are in Berkeley! And remember to make reservation or get there 15 min early before they open on weekday
589,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
590,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food.

But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
600,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good. Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."
601,"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 because of our missing food.My favorite food in the world is probably Japanese food. I loveeeeee Japanese tapas and sushi! However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...Ordered:x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."
602,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant. So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."
603,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"
604,"If you are looking for family-style Izakaya type of places in Berkeley, then you could not miss out Kiraku. If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."
605,"A lovely traditional Japanese tapa Cafe is what you'll find here. Dishes are full of flavor.  Tapas vary from pork belly, scallops to delicious varieties of fish. I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside. Customer service is excellent. waitresses are very pleasant and friendly"
606,"One of the few places for Izakaya in Berkeley! The wait varies for dinner; I've waited 15 minutes on an occasion and 45 minutes on another. It's a cute, cozy place for a date. Kiraku has an authentic Japanese vibe and the food is presented nicely. Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
607,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
608,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup. So cuteAmbiance: small place that can get pretty loudService: not bad You HAVE to try this place if you are in Berkeley! And remember to make reservation or get there 15 min early before they open on weekday
609,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
610,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food. My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
611,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult. The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them. All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
612,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting. Like I mentioned earlier, we came as a group of 5, but I feel like this restaurant is better for small groups such as a group of 2 or 3. I will most likely come back for a date!"
613,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
614,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
615,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
616,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
617,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
618,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"

The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"
624,"If you are looking for family-style Izakaya type of places in Berkeley, then you could not miss out Kiraku. If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."
625,"A lovely traditional Japanese tapa Cafe is what you'll find here. Dishes are full of flavor.  Tapas vary from pork belly, scallops to delicious varieties of fish. I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside. Customer service is excellent. waitresses are very pleasant and friendly"
626,"One of the few places for Izakaya in Berkeley! The wait varies for dinner; I've waited 15 minutes on an occasion and 45 minutes on another. It's a cute, cozy place for a date. Kiraku has an authentic Japanese vibe and the food is presented nicely. Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
627,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
628,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup. So cuteAmbiance: small place that can get pretty loudService: not bad You HAVE to try this place if you are in Berkeley! And remember to make reservation or get there 15 min early before they open on weekday
629,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
630,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food. My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
631,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult. The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them. All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
632,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting. Like I mentioned earlier, we came as a group of 5, but I feel like this restaurant is better for small groups such as a group of 2 or 3. I will most likely come back for a date!"
633,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
634,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
635,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
636,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
637,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
638,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"
639,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
640,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good. Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."
641,"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 because of our missing food.My favorite food in the world is probably Japanese food. I loveeeeee Japanese tapas and sushi! However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...Ordered:x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."
642,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant. So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."
643,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me.

A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"

I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them. All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
652,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting. Like I mentioned earlier, we came as a group of 5, but I feel like this restaurant is better for small groups such as a group of 2 or 3. I will most likely come back for a date!"
653,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
654,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
655,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
656,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
657,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
658,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"
659,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
660,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good. Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."
661,"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 because of our missing food.My favorite food in the world is probably Japanese food. I loveeeeee Japanese tapas and sushi! However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...Ordered:x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."
662,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant. So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."
663,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"
664,"If you are looking for family-style Izakaya type of places in Berkeley, then you could not miss out Kiraku. If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."
665,"A lovely traditional Japanese tapa Cafe is what you'll find here. Dishes are full of flavor.  Tapas vary from pork belly, scallops to delicious varieties of fish. I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside. Customer service is excellent. waitresses are very pleasant and friendly"
666,"One of the few places for Izakaya in Berkeley! The wait varies for dinner; I've waited 15 minutes on an occasion and 45 minutes on another. It's a cute, cozy place for a date. Kiraku has an authentic Japanese vibe and the food is presented nicely. Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
667,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
668,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup. So cuteAmbiance: small place that can get pretty loudService: not bad You HAVE to try this place if you are in Berkeley! And remember to make reservation or get there 15 min early before they open on weekday
669,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
670,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food. My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
671,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult.

However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...Ordered:x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."
682,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant. So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."
683,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"
684,"If you are looking for family-style Izakaya type of places in Berkeley, then you could not miss out Kiraku. If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."
685,"A lovely traditional Japanese tapa Cafe is what you'll find here. Dishes are full of flavor.  Tapas vary from pork belly, scallops to delicious varieties of fish. I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside. Customer service is excellent. waitresses are very pleasant and friendly"
686,"One of the few places for Izakaya in Berkeley! The wait varies for dinner; I've waited 15 minutes on an occasion and 45 minutes on another. It's a cute, cozy place for a date. Kiraku has an authentic Japanese vibe and the food is presented nicely. Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
687,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
688,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup. So cuteAmbiance: small place that can get pretty loudService: not bad You HAVE to try this place if you are in Berkeley! And remember to make reservation or get there 15 min early before they open on weekday
689,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
690,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food. My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
691,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult. The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them. All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
692,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting. Like I mentioned earlier, we came as a group of 5, but I feel like this restaurant is better for small groups such as a group of 2 or 3. I will most likely come back for a date!"
693,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
694,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
695,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
696,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
697,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
698,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"
699,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
700,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good. Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."

706,"One of the few places for Izakaya in Berkeley! The wait varies for dinner; I've waited 15 minutes on an occasion and 45 minutes on another. It's a cute, cozy place for a date. Kiraku has an authentic Japanese vibe and the food is presented nicely. Every time I've been here, we've spent at least $30-40 per person, so it's worth it to make the reservation (minimum order of $40 for person). Even without a reservation, there is a minimum order of $15 per person and $20 per person for groups of 6 or more. These were the dishes I've tried, ranked:Wagyu Tataki - tasty + nice platingSalmon carpaccio - their fish is always fresh!Grilled Black Cod - flavorful and cooked perfectly, but it's pretty small for $16Grilled Squid - good portion size and great for sharing!Agedashi Tofu - classic and comfortingPork belly skewers - exactly what you would expect; ippuku's skewers just tend to be better imoRamen/Udon - nothing special, but will get you full Corn Tempura - even though everyone raves about this, I thought it was just ok?Duck breast - I usually enjoy duck but this was nothing memorable"
707,"Yes,  the wait was long, but upon sitting down,  we were met with exceptional service and delicious food.  Favorites include Suzuki carpacio, the grilled squid, and the mochi. Come with the expectation of exceptional food and an amazing experience."
708,One of the best Japanese tapas place I've had in the states!Food (5 stars) - all the dishes we ordered worth 5 stars. - uni ikura on a bed of silky tofu: two spoons full of goodness. I personally love uni and ikura and they were really fresh. - takowasabi: octopus was very fresh with just the right amount of wasabi. This is a great dish to go along with sake - corn tempura: everyone rave about this. It was really good but then... it's just corn- roasted angus beef tongue with truffle oil: beef tongue were cut into thick slices that so tender. With a touch of truffle oil. YUM- black pork belly skewer: super tender and flavorful. Love the sauce- eel skewer: this was special of the day. And it was very fresh- sake: they let you pick your own sake cup. So cuteAmbiance: small place that can get pretty loudService: not bad You HAVE to try this place if you are in Berkeley! And remember to make reservation or get there 15 min early before they open on weekday
709,"Reservations - Must spend at least $40 per person. Made them about 3 days in advance for Sunday 7PM. There was still a crowd waiting outside. Show up early because a 7PM doesn't guarantee 7PM seating. That just means when you show up, you're automatically #1 on the waiting list at 7PM. Makes sense, right? Food - Alright.Corn Tempura with Green Tea Salt - MUST ORDER. My favorite item! Two pieces of hardened corn chunks stuck together was savory, sweet, and salty all at once.Agedashi Tofu - Simple, basic, warm, and comforting.Salmon and Mushroom Wrapped In Foil - Looked home made, but also something I just made from my own kitchen at home. Lacked flavor, but rich in texture. The mushrooms tasted better than the salmon.Jumbo Squid - Good but oddly not memorable. Black Cod - Two small, poster board thin slices of delicate, flavorful fish for $16. It never seems worth it wherever I go. Omelette with Mushroom Shoots and Fish Roe - Bland. Hot Sake - Stick with the house hot sake. Everything else tasted too sweet or dry in comparison. Interior - Small, cozy, cramped, and warm. I appreciate the sliding door at the entrance that kept the warm air inside. There are very few tables, hence the long wait time. Service - Nice, attentive, quick, and helpful. All of the waitresses shared responsibilities so any waitress would be more than happy to bring out extra wasabi if you needed."
710,"My friend just recently got a new job that was much better suited for her than the last one, so we decided to celebrate at Kiraku! She had heard of Kiraku (I had not, despite having attended college here) and knew to come early- we showed up about 15-30 minutes before opening and we were the 4th person on the waiting list. We were seated pretty quickly and ordered within some 10 minutes, but surprisingly waited a while before we were served food. My friend and I were actually to the point of getting hangry- people who had come later than us and ordered after us were getting food while we were still waiting. It /might/ have been that the staff made a ton of beef tongue to serve out first but still... We also had multiple periods of time where we had to physically flag down the wait staff for service, either to order more items or to order more alcohol. The food itself was really, really good. We ordered:-Jumbo squid: excellent!-Foie Gras Poele [insert emoji with heart eyes]: this was a seared foie gras over rice with a rich, umami sauce. Tbh, the rice was the star of the dish (although the foie gras itself was really rich and yummy). Pricey but good (especially if you're celebrating something). -Corn Fritters: a little pricey for what this was (although to be expected) but a fun item to get. It provides a nice crunch, although it would've been nice if it had come with a dressing of some sort (I don't believe it did). -Premium beef tongue: ahhhhhhh favorite dish. Juicy and savory; tender and just soooo good. Totally feeding into my beef tongue obsession, which a few years ago I could not have imagined myself saying so. We also ordered a carafe of the cheapest sake, which was still very, very good. I don't know my sake well but we really enjoyed it. It came in a beautiful carafe with a separate ice compartment for ice/chilling (I seriously want my own) and the wait staff comes by with an offering of small sake cups. Friend and I /loved/ them. We want our own to bring home haha! Overall (TL;DR): Excellent food and drink, although improvements can be made with wait staff (to pay more attention to people other than delivering items). 4/5."
711,"Kiraku is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley, which I'm not surprised by after seeing the long lines. The best wait times I've encountered are at the beginning of dinner. They open at 5:30PM but I usually come at 5PM and wait (30 minute wait is much better than the 1+ hour waits I've had before). The restaurant itself is small and cramped so it seems like big groups might be difficult. The menu here is very expansive and here are some of my favorites out of the ones I've had.+YUBA: Spoon full of delicious seafood of uni, fish eggs. Tastes like the ocean if you're into that!+CORN TEMPURA: Super crispy and slightly sweet corn, which goes really well with the salt. I'm not sure if I can taste the green tea salt but it's delicious nonetheless. Surprisingly light for all of its fried-ness. +CARTILAGE: The texture might not be agreeable with everyone but this is delicious with some lemon. It's a little crunchy on the inside but would recommend if you're feeling adventurous!+NASU MISO: This is delicious, especially for eggplant lovers. The eggplant itself is really soft and it contrasts nicely with the miso glaze on it.+ROASTED DUCK: The meat is tender and soft, though I might be partial to this one since I love duck.+JUMBO SQUID: Surprisingly soft (I've had a lot of chewy/stringy squid before) and my favorite parts are definitely the slightly crispy legs and top part of the head.+SWEET POTATO BRULEE: The texture isn't quite creme brulee (it's a little thicker) but it tastes like sweet potato and the crispy sugar is delicious with it.+YUZU MOCHI: I might be partial to this one because I love yuzu (citrus fruit) but it was a light and refreshing dessert after all the food!There's still so many dishes I want to try here and I can't wait to come back to try them. All in all, delicious small Japanese tapas that are great to share (maybe with only 1 other person so you can eat more)."
712,"Kiraku definitely gives off an authentic Japanese restaurant vibe. It is a small restaurant, so be prepared to wait or make reservations. We came as a group of 5 and put our name down around 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. We did not get seated until 7:45pm or a bit later. Everything was delicious and flavorful. It's basically all small dishes, but we kept ordering and was able to try multiple small dishes. The chicken cartilage was definitely interesting. Like I mentioned earlier, we came as a group of 5, but I feel like this restaurant is better for small groups such as a group of 2 or 3. I will most likely come back for a date!"
713,"We should have more izakayas in east bay. Good to see non-sushi Japanese restaurant being crowded. I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
714,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
715,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
716,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
717,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
718,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"
719,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
720,"Wow. Wonderful. Don't let the shabby facade fool you. This place is really good. Also, try Asahi Super Dry on draft. Very cold, yet smooth and dry. They bring it to you in a cold glass, with top 20% foamy. Put your nose close to the foam, you can feel the little bubbles popping; and, smell the bitter hop. Be sure to finish the first glass in one lifting. Do not take your lips off until you can safely put the empty glass over your head upside down."
721,"2.5 stars rounding down to 2 because of our missing food.My favorite food in the world is probably Japanese food. I loveeeeee Japanese tapas and sushi! However, this place was quite a disappointment. For the price we paid, I don't think the food was worth it at all. This restaurant is TINY so I recommend you make reservations. We were seated awkwardly between two table and the one to our right was SO close it was like we were eating a meal together...Ordered:x SHIME SABA (Torched Mackerel Sashimi) - Our server recommended this because she said it was REALLY good, but it was a little fishy... I LOVEE mackerel and used to eat it often so I was expecting to like this dish, but was super disappointed and put off by the slight fishiness. x SALMON KAMA - I prefer hamachi kama over salmon, but again we were told this is a special and really good so we ordered it. It was overcooked and just tasted like a salmon filet. x SEABASS TATAKI - The first few bites of this was really good, but the fish was mildly fishy... AGAIN. I don't think they use fresh fish here :(x CLAMS (Steamed Clams w/ Butter) - Good.x JUMBO SQUID (Grilled Whole Squid w/ Teriyaki Sauce) - Probably my favorite of the night, but this was slightly underwood which made it a weird texture... not chewy like it's supposed to be.x YUBA SPOONS (Uni & Ikura) - Thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The super downside...x MINI KAISEN DANBURY (Salmon, Ikura, Sea Urchin, and Snow Crab Over Rice) - We ordered this earlier, but we had an emergency so we had to leave. Later we realized we never got the food nor did the server take it off the check or mention it to us to take togo... considering this was $15, we were not happy...For the $150 price tag, this place was not worth it. The ingredients did not taste fresh nor did the flavors blow our minds. It was just ok.  Honestly wouldn't eat her again. Ippuku is better IMO. Pictures look WAYYY better than it tastes."
722,"So I came to Kiraku at around 8:30 hoping to get seated around 9:00 (that I thought was pretty reasonable, yeah?) Well this was literally the most frustrated I have ever been waiting to eat at a restaurant. So in front of the restaurant there's a waitlist. But you can actually write your name down at 6:30, come back at 9:00, and have priority over everyone else waiting. Enough people did that to the point my party ended up waiting an hour to eat. I can honestly say this is the first time I ever felt hopeless waiting to eat somewhere lol. I must have looked real sad asking the lady seating parties how much longer we'd have to wait because she seated us right away after I spoke with her. So here's what we ordered for the night: Housemade Tofu (4/5) - I personally dont like tofu but the way they layered the flavors with the seasonings and bonito was pretty tasty. The tofu was soft and delicious itself. It was simple and good. Slight bias just cause I'm not a huge tofu fan.Suzuki carpaccio (4.5/5) - On the other hand i love raw fish and this dish was so tasty. The flavors made such a great bite and good umami. It was one of my favorites of the night. Only con was i found it pretty salty. Otherwise it was tasty and fresh.Grilled Squid (5/5) - My favorite dish of the night! The grilled squid was not rubbery at all which can be super easy to do with squid. It was softer with a bite to it. The sauce they brush the squid with and the lemon mayo aioli sauce it comes with is great. Enjoyed this dish a lot!Corn Tempura (4.5/5) - so much hype over this dish and well deserved because it was really tasty. When i saw it on yelp i thought it might have too much batter but these little fritters were actually so well done. Again another dish that was simple and good. The food here is just prepared well. Roasted Duck (2.5/5) - Again may just be personal preference but this dish left a weird after taste in my mouth. Everyone else just said it tasted like meat lol. Organic Chicken Karaage (3/5) - this dish was just eh to me. I would have liked it to be more crispy. The chicken itself was juicy but I needed more crunch on the outside. It was also pretty oily in my humble opinion.Sweet Yuzu Sake (5/5) - I loooved how this sake tasted. It was so yummy!! But it wasn't very strong and for the most part tasted like juice. Wasn't even mad though because it was super good. Besides the point I found the food to be well above average. It didn't blow me away (maybe yelp over hyped the food for me ahah) but definitely a nice spot. Would I wait an hour to eat here again? Nah."
723,"4.5/5I've attempted to come here a few times and usually my hunger beats out my desire to try this place since I honestly thought it would just be overrated but nope it really is just that good. I will definitely wait again if I have to.Came with a friend on a Saturday. My friend couldn't eat until 8pm so we hovered around the board for a while trying to get in around 7:45pm. I put down my name at 6:30pm and was called around 40 minutes later. It was too early for us but we were told that if you don't respond, you can just tell them you're back and they'll give you the next seat.Service is very nice and attentive and all our food came out at a great pace.For our meal we got the following:1) Yuba ($12): The tofu's soy taste was very strong and it paired so well with the uni and ikura which are already a great combo. The entire bite is silky and sweet with pops of texture and saltiness from the ikura. Still a bit pricy but worth trying once. If you don't like tofu, skip this one though. (4.5/5)2) Corn tempura ($5): The only item I would recommend skipping. I'm not sure why everyone recommends it. The matcha salt is a nice element but the matcha wasn't quite strong enough to make this dish interesting. The tempura texture is close enough to the corns natural texture that it just doesn't do much. In terms of flavor, well it tastes like corn. (2/5)3) Foie gras ($24): While paying $24 for 2 oz of anything is a bit crazy, proper foie gras is totally worth it. The foie gras had a slight skin but otherwise it was clean but also fatty and delicious. The sauce was so flavorful and tied it with the toasted rice flavor so well. (5/5)4) Suzuki carpaccio ($12): My friend insisted she didn't like sea bass but she changed her mind after trying this. The fish is very thin and the yuzu flavor was very strong which I think made the perfect combo since sea bass can be a bit light on the flavor. The dish isn't sour or tart but the citrus flavors were the star of the dish for me. (4.5/5).5) Ankimo ($10): We were trying to get the eel liver but they ran out and had ankimo instead. I've had ankimo a million times before so I didn't know how this would be different but this ankimo was so light. Texturally it was like nothing on your tongue but somehow still buttery (5/5).6) Pork belly skewer ($4): If you need some cooked meat in your night you can give this an option but this dish wasn't extremely standout for me. It's exactly how you expect a pork belly skewer to taste (3/5)7) Deluxe Chazuke ($10):  It was a warm and light dish that was still packed with flavor because of the broth and the add-ons. A terrific way to end the meal (5/5)Overall, Kiraku really blew me away. I thought the 4.5 stars rating would just be because of hype but this place definitely holds up. I can't wait to go back!"
724,"If you are looking for family-style Izakaya type of places in Berkeley, then you could not miss out Kiraku. If you do not have at least 30 minutes to spare, do not even bother wait in front, as the wait time can easily exceed your expectation.Once we got seated after that lengthy wait, we found out that every minute of wait was worthwhile. Uni spoons with Ikura on top, freshly delicious! Beef tongue skewers, marinated just well! Jumbo squid, with the help of mayonnaise, impressive! Not even one dish let us down.Really tiny in space, so might feel a bit too crowded at first; yet just bare with it, food will compensate everything."
725,"A lovely traditional Japanese tapa Cafe is what you'll find here. Dishes are full of flavor.  Tapas vary from pork belly, scallops to delicious varieties of fish. I ordered the grilled black cod, grilled scallops, white Saba, salad and was very happy with the flavor.  Be prepared to splash some cash if you are trying to fill your stomach however the taste of the food is worth the cost.Skip the Rock shrimp- it is overly breaded with little actual shrimp inside.

I was looking at the Japanese menu, but the waitress didn't speak Japanese, so I had to flip the pages back and forth how the menu items translated into English. I think both languages in the same page would solve the problem. We ordered spicy tuna tartar with yam, croquette, edamame, eggplant with miso (deep-fried), and yaki-udon. Yaki-udon is 'after sake' menu, the portions are pretty large, we could have done with one more item instead of this one. Yaki-udon is bit greasy for my taste, but other items were all delicious. Tartar dish was very unique."
734,Super expensive but super tasty. Grilled skewers are awesome and also grilled squid and roasted Angus beef tongue!
735,"Found this gem when were up in Berkeley for a friend's grand opening. Hands down the best sushi restaurant with authentic and rare dishes. The place is a bit small so the wait could be long.  We ordered:Unagi skewer: the unagi was delicious and biting the fish off the skewer while it was hot. Highly recommend.Tender Beef tongue: didn't try it but my husband did and he loved it.Chicken cartilage: first time having it and it was so addicting. The seasoning was so good. I love every bite of it.Angus Beef skewer: was very tender and flavorful. Sea Urchin: they serve this in a spoon with roe give it a good balance of sweet and salt highly recommend.Rice bowl with salmon, crab meat, roe and sea urchin. This dish has a good balance of zen. Highly recommend.Sashimi 6 slices: didn't understand the waitress and she brought out double what we ordered. I guess she put in 2 orders for 2 people. The cut was on the smaller side but the fish was so fresh so good.A bottle of sake and asahi beer"
736,"This cute little place is such a pleasant surprise. I don't venture out to Berkeley too often but I'm glad that I've started exploring outside of the city because Kiraku is worth the wait. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait about 30 min for a party of two around 9pm. I tried to call prior to make reservations but no one ever picked up the phone. Once I entered the restaurant though, it all made sense. They have four waitresses total scurrying around a small little restaurant that seats up to 35 people max. The menu is also very straight forward and they have daily specials as well. You also have to get their chef special sashimi because I will eat their fish is the freshest I've tasted. So delicious. Octopus with okra- very tasty and fresh Scallops with butter-can do without next time Mini Donburi-ok but can do without Chef special sashimi- must get!!!Strawberry nigori-fave Waygu beef tataki-I'm a fan Striped bass carpaccio-pretty good Overall, I'll be back! Great, friendly service and reasonable prices for tapas"
737,"It's a fairly small restaurant thats always so busy, but always worth the wait!! We've actually started making reservations when we know we want to eat here, so we don't have to wait as long. Food is DELICIOUS!! My must haves everytime are the spicy jellyfish, uni spoon, fried corn, truffle beef tongue, and green tea ice cream. Then I order whatever else I feeling like eating that day. They usually have specials, so that's cool too. Food comes pretty fast after you order. The service isn't bad for such a busy restaurant. Probably because it's so small, but im not complaining. YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG... I LOVE KIRAKU!!"
738,"Been here twice this year and love this east bay gem (yes, I was/am a SF snob when it comes to food...born and raised around great food with my dad being a chef and just tons of options in SF).  This is another real deal.  IF you love authentic Japanese food, and I am not talking about the fancy rolls/fusion stuff with lots of frills...you will also love an appreciate this place.  I love their 3 choice of raw starters, jellyfish being the most delicious and such great texture and flavor.  The seared halibut (I think it was halibut...AMAZING), skewered pork belly and beef tongue...AWESOME and their chicken karaage and corn tempura...such great fried goodness!!!Super small place, but we have gotten lucky with a reservation in advance and a short wait time...15 minute or so, well worth it.  The cramped space adds to the novelty or authenticity...feels like you're being transported to Japan (which I haven't been but imagine it would be something like this).And our kids like it...so really...win-win!!!"
739,"The hype is real. I'd had izakaya in downtown Berkeley a few years ago and was seriously underwhelmed (and hungry) after I left, so I was wary about this place when a date suggested it awhile back. But, I wasn't paying so who cares amirite (just kidding***) If you come later in the evening on a weekday, around 8, you shouldn't have any problem snagging a table for two. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest making a reservation. There's a $40 minimum per person, but if you eat and drink like I do that should be no problem. My mom had also heard about Kiraku so I brought her here for Mother's Day, and with a party of 4 we got to sample a good range of the menu: *Beef tongue skewers - out of this world good. Super tender!*Pork belly skewers - also a solid choice, although I prefer the beef tongue over this. *Corn tempura - each order comes with two clusters, so you'll want to double up if you have more than 2 people. *Chef's special sashimi - incredibly fresh! There were also baby octopus (octopi?) which I've never had before, but ended up being all of our favorite. *Suzuki carpaccio - one of my favorite dishes here. Thinly sliced fish with a yuzu/ginger/green onion/other yumminess sauce.*Rock shrimp tempura - cooked to perfection.*Buta-kim - kimchi, pork, and a super soft poached egg. What's not to love? If you're a sake lover, they've got a ton of options for you to choose from. Service is on point, and we all left full. Mama Lee's already bugging me about when we can go back! ***(no I'm not)"
