0,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
1,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
2,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
3,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
4,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
5,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
6,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"
7,"We had a reservation and was able to come in a little earlier cause we scored on parking.  The hostess had no problem at all to seat us immediately.  Awesome.Once we sat down, it took quite a while for a server to approach us.  Once he eventually did, my goodness, he did not hide his stress well whatsoever.  He was obviously flustered and it showed.  We ordered a beer and a mixed drink.  The mixed drink was pretty watered down...and it was a martini!  How does that happen?  Anyhoo, it started to look up once we got our food items.We ordered their special pizza of the day which had octopus and mussels on it.  It was delish.  The crust was cooked well and the toppings were flavorful together.  We also ordered a burger with fries.  The burger was slightly overcooked but the overall was a thumbs up.  Food = great.  Service = not so great.  3 stars."
8,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
9,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
10,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
11,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
12,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
13,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
14,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
15,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
16,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
17,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
18,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
19,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.

All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
42,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
43,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
44,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
45,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
46,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"
47,"We had a reservation and was able to come in a little earlier cause we scored on parking.  The hostess had no problem at all to seat us immediately.  Awesome.Once we sat down, it took quite a while for a server to approach us.  Once he eventually did, my goodness, he did not hide his stress well whatsoever.  He was obviously flustered and it showed.  We ordered a beer and a mixed drink.  The mixed drink was pretty watered down...and it was a martini!  How does that happen?  Anyhoo, it started to look up once we got our food items.We ordered their special pizza of the day which had octopus and mussels on it.  It was delish.  The crust was cooked well and the toppings were flavorful together.  We also ordered a burger with fries.  The burger was slightly overcooked but the overall was a thumbs up.  Food = great.  Service = not so great.  3 stars."
48,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
49,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
50,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
51,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
52,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
53,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
54,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
55,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
56,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
57,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
58,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent.

59,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
60,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation.

83,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
84,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
85,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
86,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"
87,"We had a reservation and was able to come in a little earlier cause we scored on parking.  The hostess had no problem at all to seat us immediately.  Awesome.Once we sat down, it took quite a while for a server to approach us.  Once he eventually did, my goodness, he did not hide his stress well whatsoever.  He was obviously flustered and it showed.  We ordered a beer and a mixed drink.  The mixed drink was pretty watered down...and it was a martini!  How does that happen?  Anyhoo, it started to look up once we got our food items.We ordered their special pizza of the day which had octopus and mussels on it.  It was delish.  The crust was cooked well and the toppings were flavorful together.  We also ordered a burger with fries.  The burger was slightly overcooked but the overall was a thumbs up.  Food = great.  Service = not so great.  3 stars."
88,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
89,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
90,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
91,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
92,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
93,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
94,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
95,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
96,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
97,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
98,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent.

99,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
100,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation.

The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza).

My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
124,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
125,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
126,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"
127,"We had a reservation and was able to come in a little earlier cause we scored on parking.  The hostess had no problem at all to seat us immediately.  Awesome.Once we sat down, it took quite a while for a server to approach us.  Once he eventually did, my goodness, he did not hide his stress well whatsoever.  He was obviously flustered and it showed.  We ordered a beer and a mixed drink.  The mixed drink was pretty watered down...and it was a martini!  How does that happen?  Anyhoo, it started to look up once we got our food items.We ordered their special pizza of the day which had octopus and mussels on it.  It was delish.  The crust was cooked well and the toppings were flavorful together.  We also ordered a burger with fries.  The burger was slightly overcooked but the overall was a thumbs up.  Food = great.  Service = not so great.  3 stars."
128,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
129,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
130,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
131,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
132,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
133,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
134,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
135,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
136,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
137,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
138,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent.

139,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
140,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
141,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches.

The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."

We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
164,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
165,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
166,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"
167,"We had a reservation and was able to come in a little earlier cause we scored on parking.  The hostess had no problem at all to seat us immediately.  Awesome.Once we sat down, it took quite a while for a server to approach us.  Once he eventually did, my goodness, he did not hide his stress well whatsoever.  He was obviously flustered and it showed.  We ordered a beer and a mixed drink.  The mixed drink was pretty watered down...and it was a martini!  How does that happen?  Anyhoo, it started to look up once we got our food items.We ordered their special pizza of the day which had octopus and mussels on it.  It was delish.  The crust was cooked well and the toppings were flavorful together.  We also ordered a burger with fries.  The burger was slightly overcooked but the overall was a thumbs up.  Food = great.  Service = not so great.  3 stars."
168,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
169,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
170,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
171,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
172,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
173,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
174,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
175,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
176,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
177,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
178,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant.

179,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
180,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
181,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
182,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"

It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
206,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"
207,"We had a reservation and was able to come in a little earlier cause we scored on parking.  The hostess had no problem at all to seat us immediately.  Awesome.Once we sat down, it took quite a while for a server to approach us.  Once he eventually did, my goodness, he did not hide his stress well whatsoever.  He was obviously flustered and it showed.  We ordered a beer and a mixed drink.  The mixed drink was pretty watered down...and it was a martini!  How does that happen?  Anyhoo, it started to look up once we got our food items.We ordered their special pizza of the day which had octopus and mussels on it.  It was delish.  The crust was cooked well and the toppings were flavorful together.  We also ordered a burger with fries.  The burger was slightly overcooked but the overall was a thumbs up.  Food = great.  Service = not so great.  3 stars."
208,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
209,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
210,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
211,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
212,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
213,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
214,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
215,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
216,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
217,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
218,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
219,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
220,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
221,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
222,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
223,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
224,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there.

Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"
247,"We had a reservation and was able to come in a little earlier cause we scored on parking.  The hostess had no problem at all to seat us immediately.  Awesome.Once we sat down, it took quite a while for a server to approach us.  Once he eventually did, my goodness, he did not hide his stress well whatsoever.  He was obviously flustered and it showed.  We ordered a beer and a mixed drink.  The mixed drink was pretty watered down...and it was a martini!  How does that happen?  Anyhoo, it started to look up once we got our food items.We ordered their special pizza of the day which had octopus and mussels on it.  It was delish.  The crust was cooked well and the toppings were flavorful together.  We also ordered a burger with fries.  The burger was slightly overcooked but the overall was a thumbs up.  Food = great.  Service = not so great.  3 stars."
248,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
249,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
250,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
251,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
252,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
253,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
254,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
255,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
256,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
257,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
258,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
259,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
260,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
261,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
262,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
263,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
264,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
265,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.

287,"We had a reservation and was able to come in a little earlier cause we scored on parking.  The hostess had no problem at all to seat us immediately.  Awesome.Once we sat down, it took quite a while for a server to approach us.  Once he eventually did, my goodness, he did not hide his stress well whatsoever.  He was obviously flustered and it showed.  We ordered a beer and a mixed drink.  The mixed drink was pretty watered down...and it was a martini!  How does that happen?  Anyhoo, it started to look up once we got our food items.We ordered their special pizza of the day which had octopus and mussels on it.  It was delish.  The crust was cooked well and the toppings were flavorful together.  We also ordered a burger with fries.  The burger was slightly overcooked but the overall was a thumbs up.  Food = great.  Service = not so great.  3 stars."
288,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
289,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
290,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
291,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
292,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
293,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
294,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
295,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
296,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
297,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
298,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
299,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
300,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
301,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
302,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
303,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
304,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
305,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
306,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it.

328,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
329,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
330,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
331,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
332,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
333,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
334,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
335,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
336,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
337,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
338,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
339,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
340,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
341,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
342,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
343,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
344,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
345,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
346,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
369,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
370,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
371,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
372,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
373,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
374,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
375,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
376,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
377,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
378,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
379,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
380,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
381,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
382,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
383,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
384,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
385,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
386,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
409,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
410,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
411,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
412,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
413,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
414,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
415,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
416,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
417,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
418,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
419,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
420,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
421,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
422,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
423,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
424,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
425,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
426,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
449,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
450,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
451,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
452,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
453,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
454,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
455,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
456,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
457,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
458,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
459,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
460,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
461,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
462,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
463,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
464,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
465,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
466,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
489,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
490,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
491,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
492,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
493,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
494,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
495,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
496,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
497,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
498,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
499,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
500,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
501,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
502,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
503,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
504,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
505,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
506,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
529,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
530,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
531,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
532,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
533,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
534,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
535,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
536,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
537,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
538,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
539,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
540,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
541,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
542,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
543,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
544,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
545,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
546,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
569,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
570,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
571,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
572,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
573,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
574,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
575,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
576,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
577,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
578,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
579,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
580,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
581,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
582,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
583,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
584,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
585,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
586,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
609,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
610,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
611,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
612,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
613,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
614,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
615,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
616,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
617,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
618,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
619,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
620,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
621,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
622,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
623,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
624,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
625,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
626,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
649,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
650,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
651,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
652,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
653,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
654,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
655,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
656,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
657,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
658,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
659,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
660,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
661,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
662,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
663,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
664,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
665,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
666,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
689,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
690,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
691,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
692,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
693,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
694,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
695,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
696,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
697,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
698,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
699,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
700,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
701,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
702,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
703,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
704,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
705,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
706,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
729,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
730,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
731,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
732,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
733,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
734,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
735,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
736,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
737,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
738,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
739,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
740,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
741,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
742,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
743,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
744,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
745,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
746,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
769,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
770,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
771,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
772,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
773,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
774,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
775,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
776,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
777,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
778,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
779,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
780,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
781,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
782,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
783,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
784,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
785,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
786,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
809,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
810,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
811,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
812,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
813,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
814,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
815,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
816,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
817,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
818,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
819,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
820,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
821,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
822,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
823,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
824,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
825,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
826,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
849,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
850,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
851,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
852,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
853,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
854,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
855,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
856,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
857,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
858,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
859,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
860,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
861,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
862,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
863,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
864,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
865,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
866,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
889,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
890,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
891,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
892,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
893,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
894,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
895,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
896,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
897,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
898,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
899,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
900,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
901,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
902,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
903,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
904,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
905,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
906,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
929,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
930,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
931,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
932,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
933,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
934,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
935,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
936,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
937,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
938,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
939,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
940,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
941,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
942,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
943,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
944,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
945,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
946,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
969,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
970,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
971,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
972,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
973,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
974,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
975,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
976,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
977,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
978,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
979,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
980,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
981,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
982,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
983,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
984,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
985,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
986,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
1009,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
1010,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
1011,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
1012,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
1013,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
1014,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
1015,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
1016,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
1017,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
1018,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
1019,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
1020,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
1021,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
1022,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
1023,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
1024,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
1025,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
1026,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

1048,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
1049,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
1050,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
1051,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
1052,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
1053,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
1054,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
1055,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
1056,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
1057,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
1058,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
1059,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
1060,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
1061,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
1062,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
1063,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
1064,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
1065,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
1066,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

1088,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
1089,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
1090,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
1091,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
1092,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
1093,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
1094,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
1095,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
1096,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
1097,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
1098,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
1099,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
1100,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
1101,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
1102,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
1103,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
1104,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
1105,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
1106,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

1128,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
1129,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
1130,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
1131,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
1132,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
1133,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
1134,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
1135,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
1136,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
1137,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
1138,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
1139,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
1140,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
1141,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
1142,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
1143,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
1144,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
1145,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
1146,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

1168,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
1169,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
1170,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
1171,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
1172,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
1173,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
1174,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
1175,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
1176,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
1177,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
1178,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
1179,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
1180,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
1181,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
1182,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
1183,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
1184,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
1185,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
1186,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

1208,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
1209,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
1210,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
1211,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
1212,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
1213,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
1214,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
1215,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
1216,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
1217,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
1218,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
1219,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
1220,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
1221,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
1222,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
1223,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
1224,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
1225,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
1226,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

1248,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
1249,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
1250,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
1251,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
1252,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
1253,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
1254,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
1255,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
1256,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
1257,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
1258,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
1259,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
1260,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
1261,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
1262,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
1263,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
1264,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
1265,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
1266,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

1288,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
1289,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
1290,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
1291,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
1292,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
1293,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
1294,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
1295,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
1296,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
1297,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
1298,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
1299,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
1300,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
1301,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
1302,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
1303,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
1304,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
1305,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
1306,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

1328,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
1329,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
1330,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
1331,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
1332,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
1333,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
1334,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
1335,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
1336,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
1337,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
1338,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
1339,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
1340,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
1341,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
1342,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
1343,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
1344,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
1345,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
1346,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

1368,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
1369,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
1370,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
1371,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
1372,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
1373,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
1374,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
1375,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
1376,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
1377,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
1378,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
1379,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
1380,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
1381,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
1382,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
1383,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
1384,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
1385,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
1386,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

1408,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
1409,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
1410,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
1411,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
1412,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
1413,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
1414,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
1415,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
1416,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
1417,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
1418,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
1419,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
1420,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
1421,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
1422,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
1423,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
1424,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
1425,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
1426,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

1448,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
1449,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
1450,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
1451,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
1452,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
1453,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
1454,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
1455,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
1456,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
1457,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
1458,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
1459,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
1460,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
1461,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
1462,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
1463,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
1464,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
1465,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
1466,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

1488,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
1489,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
1490,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
1491,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
1492,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
1493,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
1494,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
1495,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
1496,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
1497,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
1498,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
1499,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
1500,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
1501,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
1502,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
1503,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
1504,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
1505,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
1506,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

1528,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
1529,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
1530,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
1531,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
1532,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
1533,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
1534,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
1535,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
1536,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
1537,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
1538,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
1539,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
1540,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
1541,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
1542,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
1543,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
1544,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
1545,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
1546,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

1568,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
1569,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
1570,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
1571,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
1572,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
1573,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
1574,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
1575,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
1576,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
1577,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
1578,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
1579,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
1580,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
1581,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
1582,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
1583,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
1584,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
1585,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
1586,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

1608,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
1609,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
1610,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
1611,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
1612,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
1613,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
1614,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
1615,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
1616,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
1617,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
1618,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
1619,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
1620,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
1621,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
1622,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
1623,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
1624,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
1625,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
1626,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

1648,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
1649,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
1650,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
1651,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
1652,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
1653,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
1654,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
1655,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
1656,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
1657,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
1658,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
1659,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
1660,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
1661,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
1662,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
1663,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
1664,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
1665,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
1666,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

1688,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
1689,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
1690,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
1691,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
1692,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
1693,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
1694,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
1695,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
1696,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
1697,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
1698,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
1699,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
1700,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
1701,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
1702,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
1703,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
1704,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
1705,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
1706,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

1728,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
1729,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
1730,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
1731,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
1732,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
1733,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
1734,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
1735,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
1736,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
1737,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
1738,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
1739,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
1740,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
1741,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
1742,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
1743,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
1744,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
1745,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
1746,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

1768,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
1769,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
1770,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
1771,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
1772,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
1773,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
1774,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
1775,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
1776,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
1777,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
1778,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
1779,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
1780,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
1781,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
1782,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
1783,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
1784,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
1785,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
1786,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

1808,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
1809,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
1810,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
1811,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
1812,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
1813,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
1814,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
1815,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
1816,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
1817,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
1818,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
1819,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
1820,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
1821,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
1822,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
1823,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
1824,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
1825,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
1826,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

1848,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
1849,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
1850,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
1851,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
1852,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
1853,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
1854,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
1855,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
1856,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
1857,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
1858,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
1859,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
1860,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
1861,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
1862,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
1863,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
1864,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
1865,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
1866,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

1888,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
1889,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
1890,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
1891,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
1892,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
1893,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
1894,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
1895,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
1896,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
1897,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
1898,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
1899,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
1900,Brunch here is great!My friend and I shared the breakfast pizza (no meat) which was bomb dot com. We walked straight in without a reservation. My star less review is because the service was mediocre. I was not impressed and had to ask for check and water multiple times. I would go here again in a heartbeat! Eggs + Pizza = Life
1901,"Gather and its popularity gave me some high expectations. Many of my friends had brought their parents here on visits and I've heard a lot about their brunches. When my SO and I came here for lunch during graduation season, we thought it would be crowded, but it was quick to get a table, almost empty. The service was great throughout the meal; the waiter constantly checked on us and was very friendly.We ordered the Pancetta Pizza with eggs, pancetta, onion, chili, and oregano with a side of Yukon potatoes. We also considered adding extra bacon on the pizza but the waiter suggested that we didn't so it wouldn't overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. This tip came highly appreciated which probably would've been more costly and less tasty for us. The pizza was okay; the crusts came a little burnt and I would've wanted more egg (there was just one in the middle of the pizza). The potatoes seem to just be roasted potatoes, which maybe we should've known wouldn't have been good to get. They were a little on the bland side and nothing that stood out. All in all, while the service was good, the food left us a little disappointed. Perhaps we got the wrong dishes, but I would definitely consider going again to try some of their other brunch items."
1902,"Really enjoyed just about everything about Gather.  In a town full of varied and interesting restaurants, this on really stands out.  The ambiance was really enjoyable.  The design is warm and inviting, with most things made of local reclaimed materials such as beams and lumber salvaged from a local mill, and bench cushions painstakingly sewn from old belts(!).  The menu seems to be custom designed every day based on what local, seasonal ingredients are available at the moment.  The creative and delicious recipes they dreamed up for us were delicious.  The wait staff was polite, knowledgeable and very professional.  On the rare occasion that they could not answer my obscure question about the ingredients of one of the dishes, they went off in search of an answer and came back promptly to fill me in.  We were very satisfied and hope to be back as soon as we can for another visit!Reservations highly recommended.  We went on a weekday, but luckily had called ahead for reservations because the place was full!"
1903,"Came in 8pm on a Friday night with a reservation but didn't seem necessary. The menu seemed fresh, though you specifically have to ask for bread/oil/butter, so don't forget! My friend at the mushroom rice cakes, which she enjoyed. I ate the steak tartare accompanied with some potato chips, which was DELICIOUS! We also had a cheese plate, though the waiter and the menu did not explain what the cheeses were... Nice ambiance and environment and great meal, would recommend and return!"
1904,Good menu. Strong drinks. Cozy ambiance. We thoroughly enjoyed our happy hour & dinner there. We didn't make a reservation but we got there just as the restaurant was opening so there was no wait at all.We gave our server a bit of a hard time because at first we wanted to sit outside. Then later we realized it was too cold and asked to be moved inside. They were cool about it. Kindly helped us move inside without any fuss.
1905,1st time here. Atmosphere is very nice cool vibe. Clean from top to bottom. Service is top notch some of the best I've had in a long time. Had the pizza. Not greasy at all and very flavorful. It's thin crust which is no issue.  The issue is the pizza was so thin it fell apart near the center of the pizza getting it to the plate. Still very good pizza I would get it again. The soup was flavorful and full of veggies in every bite. Wish they had a bigger lunch selection.  Nice place to try.
1906,"Came here for dinner with a few friends, and had semi-high expectations since I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I knew it would be pricey per past reviews, but it was a ""treat yoself"" kind of day. Inside, they have a homey, inviting environment that's dimly lit. Feels nice and homey :) I ordered the halibut and the soup of the day: chilled asparagus soup. The chilled asparagus soup was surprisingly delicious! Perfectly creamy and had just the right balance of crab and salmon roe to not overall the soup. Thoroughly enjoyed it, and even more so since it was a warm day. The halibut was somewhat disappointing. The balance of flavors was great but I found the fish itself not as great as it can be. The exterior was a bit too overdone, and thus took away from the moisture of the fish. The citrus flavors saved this dish though! Probably won't order again but glad I tried it. Will come back for brunch~"

1928,"I have been here about 3 times now and I feel like with each visit their service/quality has declined. :/ I hate to be negative, especially since this is a well-loved and popular place but for the price I just don't think the food is worth it. I love how they aim to create healthy/beautiful dishes using food that is locally sourced and sustainable - that part is great. But when it comes down to it, I'm just not gonna choose to go here over other places where you can get more for what you pay.First of all, we had to wait nearly 10-15 minutes even though we had a reservation (and showed up 5 minutes early). Also, the restaurant was mainly empty inside and there were tons of empty tables so I don't know what the hold up was about.Last time I was there I got the burger - $16 - for what turns out to be a huge block of meat and not that many toppings/flavor. The bun was also sort of burnt which ruined the flavors of each bite. The burger was cooked fine, but I felt like it could be more juicy and flavorful. Especially for $16! There was a few shreds of onion and some sauce, but thats about it. If I pay more than $10 for a burger I'm expecting something incredible.The halibut was very small. My mom got that and was still hungry afterward so she picked off everyone else's dishes - which was too bad since the halibut was $30.Overall, I would say this is a GREAT place if you are vegan / gluten free and like to have interesting options. The beet dish was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They also serve acme bread with olive oil upon request!Will I come here again? Maybe, but not my first choice."
1929,"One of those semi-pricey, small serving size kind of placed. The Fontina pizza is awesome. Not an every day, but a good treat place."
1930,"My friend chose Gather to meet for dinner, and I set my expectations low after reading some of the reviews. However, the food we tried was excellent and I can see myself craving it in future. I ordered the asparagus pizza with fresh ricotta, and it was so fresh and light for a pizza, with a unique, well-seasoned crust that was simultaneously thin and crispy yet pillowy. Portions were huge and this pizza could easily be shared by two. I could only finish half of it.  The ambience in Gather is classy yet casual. It feels good to be there and it's a great place to talk and catch up with friends. Our server was attentive and friendly but didn't hover. We weren't rushed although the place was busy, and I realized later that we actually stayed nearly 3 hours. Although delicious, I still think the pizza was a bit overpriced. I realize that just preparing fresh ricotta is a time investment.  But it's probably good that Gather is a bit pricy, or I would want to be back too often. I'll reserve this restaurant for low key but nice occasions. I'd like to try more of their food, but I think that asparagus pizza has me hooked for now."
1931,"Went here with my sister for a belated birthday lunch. It's a big restaurant and the decor is very artisanal. We went on a Sunday and had reservations for 1:15 pm, but we came 15 min early. They seated us pretty much right away!We started off with cocktails (of course). I got the Pippen Refresher and it does exactly that! It's super refreshing! Not too strong (alcohol-wise) and tastes like sparkling lemonade. Definitely recommend getting some cocktails here. They are a little pricey ($12), but not too unreasonable. Then, my sister and I ordered the Spicy Tomato pizza and the burger. The Spicy Tomato pizza is vegan and doesn't come with cheese, which we didn't realize, but didn't mind. The crust is SO GOOD. It's very thin, but the crust at the very end of the slice is thicker, airy and pure heaven. The topping itself was good, but I think next time, we're gonna try the one with cheese and maybe add some meat. The spicy tomato had a good kick, not too spicy. The cashew sauce was creamy, and the olives were very good too. However, it was just too saucy, so it was more like a bread with some dip, rather than a pizza. Still, it was very good. The burger was A-MA-ZING. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was flavorful and juicy. It came with cheese and onions. Along with the burger came with a spring mix salad and french fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. Ask for the aioli! They don't have ranch, but they have aioli that tastes SO GOOD with the fries. Service was AWESOME. Our waiter was very nice and our food came out faster than I thought it would. Love the ambiance of the place. Overall, the food was very good. I would love to come back here again and try another pizza. They have a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians, which is great. It's a bit on the more expensive side, but the quality is worth it. Very fresh ingredients and a lot of love put in the food."
1932,"Honestly pretty disappointed. First off everything was very overpriced, which I could get over if the food is good but both entrees I've had here were extremely bland.The squash, caper, and veggie pizza which sounded amazing was not only burnt but had no flavor and was incredibly dry. It barely had any cheese and tasted more like flatbread than pizza. Medium sized, $22The mushroom ragout - my god, where to begin. It was so bland I literally could not taste anything. It was some pureed quinoa blend on the bottom, a few mushrooms, and arugula on top. There could not possibly have been any sauce or seasoning or any redeeming ingredient. I love mushrooms but even the mushrooms were tasteless.  Small and about $16-17Granted it appears their brunch is more popular, but I wouldn't even return to find out because I'm so baffled how they could honestly have the mushroom ragout on their menu."
1933,"We went to Gather today for brunch and thought it was terrific.  Walking in, the hostess was delightful and Fernando, our server, was incredible.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  Food was excellent as well.  One of us had the very delicious vegan pizza, another had the burger, and I loved my fried egg sandwich.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  We even shared the walnut French toast:  a dream!!  We will definitely return here when we are back in the area.  It was a very pleasant environment with a wonderful staff."
1934,"Reservations recommended.  Surprisingly busy for 6pm on a Thursday night, which is usually a good sign. Creative cocktail menu: I ended up going with the Maiden Voyage with ""Singani 63, Lime, Rhubarb Cordial, Egg White, Blanc de Blancs, Grapefruit Bitters.""  I chose it with the idea I'd be having the halibut for the entree and they'd pair well.  The cocktail was tasty: the alcohol kick is there,  but it's still refreshing.  Instead of the halibut I ended up going with the evening's special based on my waitress' recommendation. Glad I did: it was probably one of the more unusual but tasty pizzas I've ever had.  House-made duck sausage, Bing cherries, shishito peppers, a couple of different cheeses: it was one of those flavor combinations that shouldn't work, but does.  Nice mix of salty, savory, and sweet.  One pizza would likely feed two people: I boxed up half so I could try the halvah sundae with vegan pistachio and rosewater ice creams for dessert (I'm not vegan; it just sounded good. And it was.)"
1935,"I had the small plate sea bass and gem salad.  They have a great wine selection and good service. This is a ""must visit"" restaurant in Berkeley"
1936,"Brunch spot with tons of options from pancakes, to pouched eggs, to pizza! They have a wall of picked jars fill with various produce, including dilly beans (dill pickled green bean), which makes a mean garnish for a Bloody Mary. Lattes with alternative milk options. Everything I tasted was great, although my pancakes were rather dry. Butter and syrup couldn't even save it. French toast on the other hand is a must, it was almost like dessert. Heavily vegetarian menu with touches of meat, featuring sustainable ingredients.Ridiculous cake cutting fee, $2.50 PER PERSON. Something to consider if you're throwing a birthday there."
1937,"This place is a staple of Berkeley and one of the first farm to table restaurants ever! True pioneers in the food industry. Their menu changes ""micro-seasonally"" but a few things remain on the menu year round. Their pizzas are always delicious, as is their seasonal sandwich (lunch only). They're famous for their Kale Salad but it is wilted kale so it's not crunchy like you'd expect. The menu isn't huge but there are great options for all diets and tastes. I recommend sharing small plates with your table! Dessert selection is small but everything is unique and tasty.The cocktails are fresh and creative! Plus, they have mocktails which is an added bonus for families! Atmosphere is lovely, very open and bright. Plus there is an outdoor patio! It's best to make reservations especially on the weekend, but I have been able to walk in for lunch during the week."
1938,"Gather is one of my go-to places for brunch in Berkeley. Not as popular or quaint as La Note or as college-y as Sunny Side, it's a good place to bring family or visitors, especially if they are paying.The fancy farm-to-table menu feels more at home in the Gourmet Ghetto than in downtown Berkeley, but it's still very approachable and down to earth. I'm a fan of the Mushroom Ragout ($16) with Soft-Cooked Egg ($3), the Poached Eggs in spicy lamb ragout ($18), and the Spicy Tomato Pizza ($21) with Egg ($3). The Country Breakfast ($14) is a great comfort food option; the potatoes, in particular, are outstanding. I thought the Community Grains Amber Wheat Pancakes ($13.50) were just okay though; while still enjoyable, the texture was a just a bit grainy for me.Service here can be a little inconsistent. At one moment, they are friendly and attentive, and then the next, they are nowhere to be found. But in general, there's a lot to like about this restaurant. And when it comes to weekend brunch, it's a good place to gather."
1939,5 = Food5 = Service5 = Ambience5 = decorFood was amazing considering I didn't know what to expect. l had a cup of their bean soup.  With the first bite my mouth was bursting with flavor. Good balance of Herbs and yummers.The asparagus sandwich was delicious as well. I asked for the servers recommendation and I'm glad Daniel suggested it.  The dining room is noisy so I opted to sit outside. A cold day but ok with jacket. I asked for heater but they were either  being used or not working.Great place for lunch.
