0,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
1,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment! I will certainly be back and Thank you both!"
2,"Sad low budget Prison food.With a higher price for the quality of the food.That's what I would consider my experience here.The ambiance is on point, dirty wood with mexicans(I can say that, I'm Mexican.). Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
3,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
4,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
5,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
6,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
7,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
8,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
9,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
10,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
11,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
12,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."
13,"2017 Best of the East Bay Readers' Poll Winner! Best MexicanPicante1328 Sixth St, Berkeley, picanteberkeley.comAnd we still Love the Mole Enchiladas and Manchamanteles."
14,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
15,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
16,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation. There wasn't even an offer to reimburse me for the missed items. The food is decent but I won't be ordering from Picante anymore."
17,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
18,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
19,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."

44,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
45,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
46,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
47,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
48,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
49,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
50,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
51,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
52,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."
53,"2017 Best of the East Bay Readers' Poll Winner! Best MexicanPicante1328 Sixth St, Berkeley, picanteberkeley.comAnd we still Love the Mole Enchiladas and Manchamanteles."
54,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
55,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
56,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation. There wasn't even an offer to reimburse me for the missed items. The food is decent but I won't be ordering from Picante anymore."
57,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
58,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
59,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
60,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
61,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment! I will certainly be back and Thank you both!"
62,"Sad low budget Prison food.With a higher price for the quality of the food.That's what I would consider my experience here.The ambiance is on point, dirty wood with mexicans(I can say that, I'm Mexican.). Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."

But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
89,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
90,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
91,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
92,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."

94,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
95,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
96,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation. There wasn't even an offer to reimburse me for the missed items. The food is decent but I won't be ordering from Picante anymore."
97,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
98,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
99,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
100,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
101,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment! I will certainly be back and Thank you both!"
102,"Sad low budget Prison food.With a higher price for the quality of the food.That's what I would consider my experience here.The ambiance is on point, dirty wood with mexicans(I can say that, I'm Mexican.). Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
103,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
104,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
105,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
106,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
107,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."

134,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
135,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
136,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation. There wasn't even an offer to reimburse me for the missed items. The food is decent but I won't be ordering from Picante anymore."
137,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
138,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
139,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
140,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
141,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment! I will certainly be back and Thank you both!"
142,"Sad low budget Prison food.With a higher price for the quality of the food.That's what I would consider my experience here.The ambiance is on point, dirty wood with mexicans(I can say that, I'm Mexican.). Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
143,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
144,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
145,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
146,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
147,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
148,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
149,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
150,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
151,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."

177,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
178,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
179,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
180,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
181,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment! I will certainly be back and Thank you both!"
182,"Sad low budget Prison food.With a higher price for the quality of the food.That's what I would consider my experience here.The ambiance is on point, dirty wood with mexicans(I can say that, I'm Mexican.). Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
183,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
184,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
185,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
186,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
187,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
188,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
189,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
190,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
191,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
192,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."
193,"2017 Best of the East Bay Readers' Poll Winner! Best MexicanPicante1328 Sixth St, Berkeley, picanteberkeley.comAnd we still Love the Mole Enchiladas and Manchamanteles."
194,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
195,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."

The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
220,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
221,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment! I will certainly be back and Thank you both!"
222,"Sad low budget Prison food.With a higher price for the quality of the food.That's what I would consider my experience here.The ambiance is on point, dirty wood with mexicans(I can say that, I'm Mexican.). Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
223,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
224,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
225,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
226,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
227,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
228,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
229,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
230,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
231,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
232,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."

234,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
235,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
236,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation. There wasn't even an offer to reimburse me for the missed items. The food is decent but I won't be ordering from Picante anymore."
237,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
238,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
239,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional.

He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
263,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
264,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
265,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
266,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
267,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
268,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
269,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
270,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
271,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
272,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."
273,"2017 Best of the East Bay Readers' Poll Winner! Best MexicanPicante1328 Sixth St, Berkeley, picanteberkeley.comAnd we still Love the Mole Enchiladas and Manchamanteles."
274,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
275,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
276,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation. There wasn't even an offer to reimburse me for the missed items. The food is decent but I won't be ordering from Picante anymore."
277,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
278,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
279,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
280,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
281,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment! I will certainly be back and Thank you both!"
282,"Sad low budget Prison food.With a higher price for the quality of the food.That's what I would consider my experience here.The ambiance is on point, dirty wood with mexicans(I can say that, I'm Mexican.). Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito.

My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
308,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
309,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
310,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
311,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
312,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."
313,"2017 Best of the East Bay Readers' Poll Winner! Best MexicanPicante1328 Sixth St, Berkeley, picanteberkeley.comAnd we still Love the Mole Enchiladas and Manchamanteles."
314,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
315,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
316,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation. There wasn't even an offer to reimburse me for the missed items. The food is decent but I won't be ordering from Picante anymore."
317,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
318,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
319,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
320,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
321,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment! I will certainly be back and Thank you both!"
322,"Sad low budget Prison food.With a higher price for the quality of the food.That's what I would consider my experience here.The ambiance is on point, dirty wood with mexicans(I can say that, I'm Mexican.). Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
323,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
324,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
325,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
326,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite.

Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
352,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."

354,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
355,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
356,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation. There wasn't even an offer to reimburse me for the missed items. The food is decent but I won't be ordering from Picante anymore."
357,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
358,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
359,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
360,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
361,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment! I will certainly be back and Thank you both!"
362,"Sad low budget Prison food.With a higher price for the quality of the food.That's what I would consider my experience here.The ambiance is on point, dirty wood with mexicans(I can say that, I'm Mexican.). Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
363,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
364,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
365,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
366,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
367,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
368,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
369,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
370,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."

I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
396,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation. There wasn't even an offer to reimburse me for the missed items. The food is decent but I won't be ordering from Picante anymore."
397,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
398,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
399,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
400,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
401,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment! I will certainly be back and Thank you both!"
402,"Sad low budget Prison food.With a higher price for the quality of the food.That's what I would consider my experience here.The ambiance is on point, dirty wood with mexicans(I can say that, I'm Mexican.). Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
403,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
404,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
405,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
406,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
407,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
408,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
409,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
410,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
411,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
412,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."

414,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
415,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out.

This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
439,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
440,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
441,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment! I will certainly be back and Thank you both!"
442,"Sad low budget Prison food.With a higher price for the quality of the food.That's what I would consider my experience here.The ambiance is on point, dirty wood with mexicans(I can say that, I'm Mexican.). Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
443,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
444,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
445,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
446,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
447,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
448,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
449,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
450,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
451,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
452,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."

454,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
455,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
456,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation. There wasn't even an offer to reimburse me for the missed items. The food is decent but I won't be ordering from Picante anymore."
457,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
458,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly.

Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
483,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
484,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
485,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
486,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
487,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
488,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
489,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
490,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
491,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
492,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."

494,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
495,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
496,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation. There wasn't even an offer to reimburse me for the missed items. The food is decent but I won't be ordering from Picante anymore."
497,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
498,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
499,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
500,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
501,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment!

I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
527,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
528,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
529,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
530,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
531,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
532,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."
533,"2017 Best of the East Bay Readers' Poll Winner! Best MexicanPicante1328 Sixth St, Berkeley, picanteberkeley.comAnd we still Love the Mole Enchiladas and Manchamanteles."
534,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
535,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
536,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation. There wasn't even an offer to reimburse me for the missed items. The food is decent but I won't be ordering from Picante anymore."
537,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
538,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
539,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
540,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
541,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment! I will certainly be back and Thank you both!"
542,"Sad low budget Prison food.With a higher price for the quality of the food.That's what I would consider my experience here.The ambiance is on point, dirty wood with mexicans(I can say that, I'm Mexican.). Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
543,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
544,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."

570,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
571,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
572,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."

574,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
575,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
576,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation. There wasn't even an offer to reimburse me for the missed items. The food is decent but I won't be ordering from Picante anymore."
577,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
578,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
579,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
580,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
581,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment! I will certainly be back and Thank you both!"
582,"Sad low budget Prison food.With a higher price for the quality of the food.That's what I would consider my experience here.The ambiance is on point, dirty wood with mexicans(I can say that, I'm Mexican.). Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
583,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
584,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
585,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
586,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
587,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
588,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
589,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante.

I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
616,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation. There wasn't even an offer to reimburse me for the missed items. The food is decent but I won't be ordering from Picante anymore."
617,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
618,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
619,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
620,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
621,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment! I will certainly be back and Thank you both!"
622,"Sad low budget Prison food.With a higher price for the quality of the food.That's what I would consider my experience here.The ambiance is on point, dirty wood with mexicans(I can say that, I'm Mexican.). Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
623,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
624,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
625,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
626,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
627,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
628,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
629,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
630,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
631,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
632,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."

658,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
659,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
660,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
661,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment! I will certainly be back and Thank you both!"
662,"Sad low budget Prison food.With a higher price for the quality of the food.That's what I would consider my experience here.The ambiance is on point, dirty wood with mexicans(I can say that, I'm Mexican.). Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
663,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
664,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
665,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
666,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
667,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
668,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
669,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
670,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
671,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
672,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."
673,"2017 Best of the East Bay Readers' Poll Winner! Best MexicanPicante1328 Sixth St, Berkeley, picanteberkeley.comAnd we still Love the Mole Enchiladas and Manchamanteles."
674,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
675,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
676,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation.

700,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
701,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment! I will certainly be back and Thank you both!"
702,"Sad low budget Prison food.With a higher price for the quality of the food.That's what I would consider my experience here.The ambiance is on point, dirty wood with mexicans(I can say that, I'm Mexican.). Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
703,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
704,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
705,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
706,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
707,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
708,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
709,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
710,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
711,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
712,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."

714,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
715,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
716,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation. There wasn't even an offer to reimburse me for the missed items. The food is decent but I won't be ordering from Picante anymore."
717,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
718,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
719,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter.

But as I mentioned, third time."
743,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
744,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
745,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
746,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
747,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
748,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
749,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
750,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
751,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
752,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."
753,"2017 Best of the East Bay Readers' Poll Winner! Best MexicanPicante1328 Sixth St, Berkeley, picanteberkeley.comAnd we still Love the Mole Enchiladas and Manchamanteles."
754,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
755,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
756,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation. There wasn't even an offer to reimburse me for the missed items. The food is decent but I won't be ordering from Picante anymore."
757,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
758,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
759,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
760,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
761,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment! I will certainly be back and Thank you both!"
762,"Sad low budget Prison food.With a higher price for the quality of the food.That's what I would consider my experience here.The ambiance is on point, dirty wood with mexicans(I can say that, I'm Mexican.). Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito.

I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
788,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
789,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
790,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
791,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
792,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."

794,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
795,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
796,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation. There wasn't even an offer to reimburse me for the missed items. The food is decent but I won't be ordering from Picante anymore."
797,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
798,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
799,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
800,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
801,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment! I will certainly be back and Thank you both!"
802,"Sad low budget Prison food.With a higher price for the quality of the food.That's what I would consider my experience here.The ambiance is on point, dirty wood with mexicans(I can say that, I'm Mexican.). Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
803,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
804,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
805,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
806,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."

Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
832,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."

834,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
835,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
836,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation. There wasn't even an offer to reimburse me for the missed items. The food is decent but I won't be ordering from Picante anymore."
837,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
838,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
839,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
840,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
841,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment! I will certainly be back and Thank you both!"
842,"Sad low budget Prison food.With a higher price for the quality of the food.That's what I would consider my experience here.The ambiance is on point, dirty wood with mexicans(I can say that, I'm Mexican.). Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
843,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
844,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
845,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
846,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
847,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
848,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
849,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
850,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."

I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
876,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation. There wasn't even an offer to reimburse me for the missed items. The food is decent but I won't be ordering from Picante anymore."
877,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
878,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
879,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
880,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
881,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment! I will certainly be back and Thank you both!"
882,"Sad low budget Prison food.With a higher price for the quality of the food.That's what I would consider my experience here.The ambiance is on point, dirty wood with mexicans(I can say that, I'm Mexican.). Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
883,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
884,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
885,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
886,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
887,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
888,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
889,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
890,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
891,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
892,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."

894,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
895,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out.

This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
919,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
920,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
921,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment! I will certainly be back and Thank you both!"
922,"Sad low budget Prison food.With a higher price for the quality of the food.That's what I would consider my experience here.The ambiance is on point, dirty wood with mexicans(I can say that, I'm Mexican.). Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
923,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
924,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
925,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
926,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
927,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
928,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
929,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
930,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
931,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
932,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."

934,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
935,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
936,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation. There wasn't even an offer to reimburse me for the missed items. The food is decent but I won't be ordering from Picante anymore."
937,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
938,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly.

Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
963,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
964,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
965,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
966,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
967,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
968,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
969,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
970,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
971,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
972,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."

974,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
975,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
976,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation. There wasn't even an offer to reimburse me for the missed items. The food is decent but I won't be ordering from Picante anymore."
977,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
978,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
979,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
980,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
981,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment!

I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
1007,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
1008,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
1009,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
1010,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
1011,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
1012,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."
1013,"2017 Best of the East Bay Readers' Poll Winner! Best MexicanPicante1328 Sixth St, Berkeley, picanteberkeley.comAnd we still Love the Mole Enchiladas and Manchamanteles."
1014,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
1015,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
1016,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation. There wasn't even an offer to reimburse me for the missed items. The food is decent but I won't be ordering from Picante anymore."
1017,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
1018,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
1019,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
1020,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
1021,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment! I will certainly be back and Thank you both!"
1022,"Sad low budget Prison food.With a higher price for the quality of the food.That's what I would consider my experience here.The ambiance is on point, dirty wood with mexicans(I can say that, I'm Mexican.). Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
1023,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
1024,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."

But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
1050,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
1051,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
1052,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."

1054,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
1055,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
1056,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation. There wasn't even an offer to reimburse me for the missed items. The food is decent but I won't be ordering from Picante anymore."
1057,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
1058,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
1059,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
1060,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
1061,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment! I will certainly be back and Thank you both!"
1062,"Sad low budget Prison food.With a higher price for the quality of the food.That's what I would consider my experience here.The ambiance is on point, dirty wood with mexicans(I can say that, I'm Mexican.). Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
1063,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
1064,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
1065,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
1066,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
1067,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
1068,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side

1094,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
1095,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
1096,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation. There wasn't even an offer to reimburse me for the missed items. The food is decent but I won't be ordering from Picante anymore."
1097,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
1098,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
1099,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
1100,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
1101,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment! I will certainly be back and Thank you both!"
1102,"Sad low budget Prison food.With a higher price for the quality of the food.That's what I would consider my experience here.The ambiance is on point, dirty wood with mexicans(I can say that, I'm Mexican.). Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
1103,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
1104,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
1105,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
1106,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
1107,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
1108,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
1109,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
1110,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
1111,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."

1137,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
1138,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
1139,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
1140,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
1141,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment! I will certainly be back and Thank you both!"
1142,"Sad low budget Prison food.With a higher price for the quality of the food.That's what I would consider my experience here.The ambiance is on point, dirty wood with mexicans(I can say that, I'm Mexican.). Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
1143,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
1144,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
1145,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
1146,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
1147,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
1148,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
1149,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
1150,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
1151,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
1152,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."

1154,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
1155,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."

New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
1180,"I am a regular. Picante is one of my favorite places to bring clients and work associates during the work day. The ambiance is fun. You'll see people making tortillas right in front of you. Mexican food being one of my favorite food types, I can say the food quality is great. Steak burritos are amazing. In my dream world, I would like to see fajitas and free chips. Besides that. Good place with yummy food.I also want to mention that at one point I had a less than ideal experience with a Picante transaction on my credit statement that didn't line up with my receipt. I felt violated. Jim, the owner of Picante was very responsive in reaching back out to me to do his best to resolve the issue.... it appears that my credit card statement was rolling in a ""pending transaction"" with the transacted amount, bloating the appearance of both into a single transaction. It resolved itself in a few days. Even still. I appreciate the responsiveness. Thanks!"
1181,"Don't waste your time in line! We ordered nachos and margaritas and had to order shots of tequila just to fill the margarita - they have NO alcohol in them! They are sugar drinks! The nachos came with the largest slices of jalapeños I've ever seen - they were in editable with the jalapeño, we had to pick them out! Laziness at its finest with this place!UPDATE: I was contacted by both the owner, Jim and Manager on duty that evening, Alex and they've been incredibly communicative and gracious! Alex provided  vouchers to return and a reimbursement of our tequila shots. Both men have been apologetic as they truly care about their patrons and the community who supports the establishment! I will certainly be back and Thank you both!"
1182,"Sad low budget Prison food.With a higher price for the quality of the food.That's what I would consider my experience here.The ambiance is on point, dirty wood with mexicans(I can say that, I'm Mexican.). Felt clean, with loud music so it was hard to yell my order to the cashier that was 4 feet in front of me. Food didn't take long, so that's where the one star comes in. Along with the friendly whispering employees. If you have friends and family that are visiting, or you yourself are passing by the area. I would recommend the food trucks near by.  I waited for my third visit to write this review. Hate to do this to an establishment, but the price is only justified with the VIP parking, take out section and amount of space to move about inside. Happy eating and hope others are able to enjoy this place.My last order consisted of to go, grilled chicken plate with pinto beans, rice and tortillas on the side. The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
1183,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
1184,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
1185,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
1186,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
1187,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
1188,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
1189,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
1190,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
1191,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
1192,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."
1193,"2017 Best of the East Bay Readers' Poll Winner! Best MexicanPicante1328 Sixth St, Berkeley, picanteberkeley.comAnd we still Love the Mole Enchiladas and Manchamanteles."
1194,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
1195,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
1196,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation. There wasn't even an offer to reimburse me for the missed items. The food is decent but I won't be ordering from Picante anymore."
1197,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
1198,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."

The chicken was chewy and didn't want to risk getting sick as the color was a bit strange to me. The portions of rice and beans was basically a single spoon(not serving spoon.) I though I order ceviche, got what looks like sad tomato sauces kimchi. Tasted like watered down onions and tomato sauce. For 12 dollars(DONT do it!). My roommate had me order him a burrito. He texted me right after I dropped of his food with, ""thank you for the tortilla wrapped compost pile, going to ch!p0*^%."". So not sure what that meant, I would say maybe it wasn't their day. But as I mentioned, third time."
1223,"Best. Tacos. In. Berkeley. Pitchers of margaritas, salsa verde and chipotle in a fridge for patrons to share, masa being handmade and cooked up right in the front. Was surprised to catch this place without a line out the door but you can always find a table and short line on a weekday night during summer (school's out). Favorite tacos: al pastor and carnitas."
1224,"I'm confused why this restaurant exists.  I had the steak tacos and sampled their Al Pastor meat...the steak was offensively bland and the Al Pastor meat was nothing like what Al Pastor meat typically tastes like (read: it was horrible).  The tortillas were flavorless as well.  I've had my share of disappointing tacos in my life and the tacos at Picante are very high on that list.  On top of bad food, Picante adds insult to injury with their high prices.  I'm giving it one star because the guac is actually pretty good.  Ugh...what a waste."
1225,"Pretty decent place for Mexican food in Berkeley.   It's a short walk from Fieldwork brewing which is nice.   The place had a bit of a line, but it moved quickly.   I had the chorizo and potato burrito which was good, but I think it could have been a bit spicier.   The food was good, it just wasn't WOW.   The folks there were friendly and helpful which was nice.   It's a bit pricy but hey, it's the location.   Will I be back?   Perhaps the next time I visit Fieldwork, I'll stop by.   Good job folks."
1226,"Mexican restaurants are always so hard to rate. So many good ones. Picante is one of those places that are above average, but it hasn't really blown my mind. I've had a enchiladas and I wasn't a fan of the chicken inside. I've had the taquitos and those were definitely good. I've also had their nachos and that was by far my favorite. Prices are Berkeley range. Definitely not as cheap as a taqueria. But in their defense, the portions are huge. They also make everything fresh to order, you can even see them make tortillas fresh."
1227,"I've not been here before but my first impression is: The place is crazy, you are on your own to find a place to sit, but the staff seems to have a handle on everything that is going on and the food is outstanding!We tried a variety of foods and my wife, son, and I were happy with all of it.  The chips are crazy good (just the right size, crunch, and salt), the guacamole was a good serving for three people, we tried the ceviche tostadas were out of sight, and I loved my chorizo soft tacos. My wife and son both had burritos and my sons was gone so quickly I'm not really sure he tasted it, but he said it was really good.My only stress here is the noise and bustle which is why I didn't give it five stars.  After a while constant level of sound became heavy and it took away from the fun I had with food and family. I'm also not a fan of hovering and coveting chairs. I was lucky that I went with my mother-in-law and my sister-in-laws family so we were able to split up into hunter-gatherer parties (some ordering food, others finding places to eat).I'm going to be back, probably multiple times, though I think I'll try out the take-out service next time to avoid the crowd."
1228,So you have to order your food before your seated which kinda is a bummer but didn't mind that part. The empanadas were delicious we loved them and would come back just for them and some beans and rice. But to finish this thing off the the wet burrito wasn't all that great the salsa verde on top was from out of a can same with the enchiladas and not made in house/homade. Also the wett burrito and regular burrito we ordered was not hot or warm enough kinda on the chill side
1229,"Picante has hormone and antibiotic free meat and non GMO corn tortillas; that's the good stuff for sure. Besides that, it's big, noisy, expensive, and bland. My recommendation is if you've got lots of cash and are looking for something healthy to feed the little ones go to Picante. But if you're looking for yummy Mexican food at reasonable prices there are better in town."
1230,"Went on a sunny day to sit outside and have a beer, but ended up eating a lot too, and I was very happy I did. I shared the fish tacos (very good), chicken taquitos (OK), nachos (very good), and the sides that came with the dishes (guacamole, beans and salad- all excellent). The service was quick and friendly and the prices are reasonable. A really good option for simple Mexican food."
1231,"After a few minuets of reading mixed reviews, I decided the only way to know for sure is to eat there myself. Plus I had also received a voucher towards my meal in the mail. At first glance: great curb appeal, it definitely will get your attention. The seating outside with umbrellas and strung lights you'll want to sit outside. They do have a parking lot on the corner. It was an early dinner around 7pm and extremely busy, I was kind of shocked to see so many patrons dinning in and even the take out line was long. You place your order before you seat yourself. Ordered: Taco Shrimp Diabla Salad with pinto beansEmpanadas ( are overpriced for not having any MEAT in them ) Flan one of their house specialty juices ( sorry I forgot the name )Taste:Flan was just okay, could use more of the sweet syrupShrimp Salad - Is HUGE!!!! only a few pieces of taco chips were found beneath all the toppings. I was expecting a taco shell like bowl...Empanadas - with no meat, veggie ! nice size but I would not order those again. Juice - I cant recall the name just remember it was sweet and a deep red/purple like colorService was awesome, super quick at bringing out dishes and host at the counters taking the orders are very friendly. Everything ordered could be shared between two people."
1232,"Food is pretty good. Between 3 and 4 stars. Shared fish tacos and taquitos. Guac was fresh and good. Also had some nachos, loaded with toppings. Two outdoor seating areas and dog friendly, good service as well."
1233,"2017 Best of the East Bay Readers' Poll Winner! Best MexicanPicante1328 Sixth St, Berkeley, picanteberkeley.comAnd we still Love the Mole Enchiladas and Manchamanteles."
1234,"I had the unfortunate experience of having a caterer no-show on me at a winery around the corner last week.  I walked into Picante and spoke with the manager on duty and asked if he could prepare dinner for 35 people in 30-45 minutes.  Without batting an eye, he said yes.  Needless to say I was beyond relieved.  Not only was more than enough food prepared and ready in 30 minutes, but it was delicious!  Everyone loved the tacos and raved about the salsa and guacamole.  Picante seriously saved the day!  Later that night, I was looking over the receipt and realized the manager gave me a ""goodwill"" discount.  I couldn't believe it!  I hope he's reading this, because I want him to know how grateful I was for his calm, kind demeanor and that he really turned an awful night into something positive.  THANK YOU!"
1235,"I love Picante, it's one of my favorite places to go for dinner in the East Bay. Especially following a beer sampler down the street at Fieldwork. I'm a SF native and I grew up in the Mission, so I have to say that I eat Mexican food at least three times a week. I also cook Latin food all the time, so when I come here - it's usually because I want to eat out. I'm also not looking to replace my old school SF faves, but wanted a little spot near my house to dine in or pick up. Picante caters more to what I call a ""Berkeley Burrito"" crowd, which tends to be a little more on the healthy, organic and less on the authentic side.  Still, I love coming here for dinner with a margarita or michelada - they make them good. My favorites are the Sopa de Mariscos (expensive, but a lot of seafood), Verde soup (Vegetarian, made with ground roasted pumpkin seed and tomatillo) and Carne Asada Tostada Salad. I love the chips, so I always buy a guacamole and it comes with enough chips for days. My boyfriend always goes for the carne asada super burrito or the fish taco plate. I've had a few other dishes that were good, but didn't make my top picks. The ceviche was just okay, but I've had better at the two taco trucks in my neighborhood - so I pass on that, although ceviche is one of my favorite foods."
1236,"Be careful getting food to go and make sure to check your order. Have had multiple occasions where items have been missed. The last time when I called to notify them of this, I got a dismissive response along the lines of ""We're not automated, and people make mistakes"" instead of an apology and asking how they could rectify the situation. There wasn't even an offer to reimburse me for the missed items. The food is decent but I won't be ordering from Picante anymore."
1237,"3.5 stars Picante was super close to our former residence in the East Bay.  I had a hankering for some corn tortillas and fish so we decided to check this spot out.  I ended up ordering the pescado veracruzana, cod with a tomato caper sauce.  Delicious.  The flavors were on point and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The tortillas appeared to be really fresh which made the meal that much better.  I wasn't too big of a fan of their salsas but they were decent.  Order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.  I've only been here once but I generally was impressed with our visit.  I'd come back again."
1238,"This is a toughy; honestly the review should be more of a 3 and a half star review, but since I can't do that I rounded down. The food was very good and the mango margarita was strong without making me feel like I was sick and drowning in tequila. I got the tostada salad with corn tortillas, black beans and manchamanteles chicken and they let me add pickled jalapeños. We also got an order of the chips and salsa. I loved the think crunchy greasy strips of fried tortillas! The salsas unfortunately were not hot, even the one that they claimed was. I kinda expected more from a place called picante, but oh well that's just my preference. I'm the person that should carry my own hot sauce with me. It was a Friday night and we were able to find a nice spot outside; the line had been long but it moved quickly. The only reason I don't feel comfortable giving picante a four star review is because they had forgotten about my boyfriend's tacos. The margaritas and chips came out very fast and my tostada soon followed; then the server said ""oh you didn't get your tacos yet"". Not a problem, we assumed they'd be on their way shortly. We proceeded to wait and nothing happened. After ten ish minutes still nothing. Eventually we had to flag down a server and basically re order the tacos. This was an isolated event but I felt like if we didn't say anything they never would have come out, despite the server noting that we hadn't gotten them yet. Again, I'm sure this isn't a regular problem and it was a busy Friday night, but it's just something to be aware of.But all in all I liked the place and will be back! And hopefully next time can give them 4 stars."
1239,"I have been eating Picante's food since the 1980s. Have seen the former ownership and the new ownership. The expansion of the menu with seafood dishes. Some of my favorites: Al pastor tacos, she is enchiladas with red sauce, empanadas (on the appetizers menu but enough for a small meal), Caesar salad (no chicken-- as an accompaniment to any dish I order). But what I like about this place is the fact that there are so many terrific dishes to choose from. Every Friday night you'll find me there. Service is exceptional. New comers think that they can just ask the servers to bring them anything, but you really need to follow their system and stand in line and order at the counter. The food will be delivered to you within five minutes. The servers are professional and pleasant."
