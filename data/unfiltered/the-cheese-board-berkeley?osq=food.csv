0,"If you're here with family, friends, with two, solo, just buy the whole dang pizza because you'll regret not having the chance to scarf it down. Sure, you might have leftovers- take it home and freeze if it makes it until the next day. Or you can stand in line again for another half; the line is terribly long down the street, but the place is so efficient it will only take minutes. This pizza is good because of the dough. The dough is good because it is, in essence, bread. Good bread. Bread that can be eaten without the fripperies of tomato sauce, cheese, and whatever one topping they decide to do for the day. But they add this stuff to the good bread and it becomes a lovely pizza."
1,"When I told my LA friends I was heading up to Berkeley, two said this was the ""best"" place and that I ""must go."" They raved about the eggplant topping. Wait time & seating: Came around 2pm on a Saturday and the line took us about 20-30minutes. There is an incredibly limited amount of seating for the amount of people who come by, so get to praying before you arrive. We lucked out with seats by the live band, which was neat but made it difficult to talk without yelling. Pizza comes out incredibly fast, because they only serve one type per day. Food: I'm personally a fan of thicker, chewier crusts, so this was disappointing and didn't amount to the hype it received. It was average pizza with average, unmemorable toppings (the day I went). It's probably better other days, but not a fan of the ""take your chance"" game if I'm craving pizza one day. Price: For $24 (after tax), the pizza certainly wasn't worth it. More of a hype place, based on that day's pizza."
2,"I've heard about the Cheese Board from multiple friends for a long time but have not tried it until last week. We arrived around 11am and there were already a lot of people there because the bakery/cheese side is open by 8am. Even though the pizza side doesn't open until 11:30, there were already a lot of people waiting around for it. I recommend getting there early if you want to avoid a wait. People start to form an official line as soon as they open at 11:30.I didn't try and of the cheese but the bakery side had lots of good bread and baked goods options. We ended up buying the Sunday Bread, scone, chocolate things, and the Ginger Molasses cookie. All of them were really good! The Sunday bread and chocolate things can be a bit dense and dry if you eat it the next day but I found microwaving them to be a good way to enjoy them :) I found out that the Cheese Board only makes one flavor a day. The pizza of the day was with roasted potatoes (carbs on carbs), caramelized onions, mozzarella, and cave aged gruyere, cheese, garlic olive oil, parsley, and oregano. Even though they only make one flavor a day they do have vegan options. The pizzas were very reasonably priced, at $3 slice. When I got the pizza it was  burning hot, which is not necessarily a bad thing but I found it hard to even leave it on my lap when I was trying to eat it in their outdoor seating area. Even though I'm not usually a pizza fan, I enjoyed the pizza here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the area again.Pros:- Bakery and Cheese shop open early, can shop there while waiting for the pizza- Half baked pizza available at the bakery- Fresh pizza - Vegetarian and Vegan optionsCons:- Only one flavor so if you don't like it then there's not much of an alternative- Long lines and really crowded - Staffs are not the friendliest people, don't really bother to greet you or even smile- Pizza on the oily size so make sure to grab napkins!"
3,"If you a cheese lover, you have to come here. They have so many cheeses I didn't even know existed.They also have a large variety of breads, though not as extravagant as their cheese selection. I got 6 English muffins for $5.50. I'm not a big fan of English muffins, but they were the best English muffins I've ever had. I ate one right when I got them, and put the rest in the fridge hoping they would still be fluffy. When I took them out of the fridge, they were rock hard, but I popped them in the fridge. Like magic, they were back to the soft soft fluffy English muffins they were the day before. So far, I haven't tried anything else, but am definitely going to go back and try their other breads and cheeses.**note: If you are looking for pizza, it's next door. I accidentally came in here because I was in a hurry and saw the word cheese and thought this was Cheese Board Pizza. (silly me)TL;DR Cheese heaven"
4,"Good selection of cheese, bread and other sweet and savory snacks.  Coffee is decent. The sweet goodies aren't that sugary, which is a good thing for me. Store hours are short. Staff is polite but don't not friendly enough to spend much time with you explaining about the products."
5,"Wow, an array of cheeses and it was packed on a Saturday afternoon! I snuck into the bread line and got two cheese breads, a wolverine, and an olive focaccia bread. Only had the cheese breads, and my friend loved the burnt cheese all over it. It was a little too burnt and crunch for me, but it was really delicious! Fresh and warm out of the oven! Prices are really fair as well."
6,"Before there was Cheese Board Pizza there was the Cheese Board Collective.  They've been in Berkeley since 1967 and were, along w/ Peet's, the beginnings of the Gourmet Ghetto.  They became a worker owned co-op in 1971.  They were one of the first cheese shops I encountered as a young woman and they were probably the first bakery in Berkeley to make a proper baguette w/ the authentic texture.  In the beginning they were a cool little shop and over the decades they have grown into a powerhouse.  They still sell a wide variety of cheeses, but they also sell a rotating range of baked goods, most savory and some sweet and their iconic pizza.  The pizza is sold half baked to take home or ready to eat slices to eat there, or on the median strip, despite the signs.  We check their pizza offerings, which change daily, online and buy half a pizza to bake for dinner when it sounds good.  I have a separate review for Cheese Board Pizza, which has become our preferred pizza source because of their imaginative combinations.  The Cheese Board also has live music, one group at lunch, another at dinner, which is very cool"
7,"Even with the storm, this doesn't seem to deter the huge crowds on a Saturday morning wanting their gluten fix. Came here with the intent of buying some cheese, but ended up with a bag of baked goods, pizza, and their green sauce.  I'm obsessed with their green sauce, and will slather it on everything possible! So excited that the cheese shop carries them here for $4/container. They have tons of local and international cheeses, with samples available. They also carry Cowgirl Creamery! My favs: cheese rolls, provolone olive roll, and all their Cowgirl Creamery cheeses PRO TIP: They sell their half baked pizzas at the bakery as well, if you want to avoid the lines at their restaurant next door. However, there's lines here too, but they move quick!"
8,"It was my very first time here yesterday and I was shocked at how many people were waiting in line for this pizza. I thought to myself, wow is it really that good? Lol well it definitely was tasty! I've never had a pizza like this! The flavor was so tangy and delicious definitely worth the 25 min wait!"
9,"- Had a special ""Pride Celebration"" pizza... Heirloom tomato, red onion, mozzarella and aged Asiago cheese, garlic olive oil, parsley, oregano. Highly recommend it.- A little on the cheesy side for my own liking...but thats to be expected given the name, and the cheese was amazing. - Very reasonably priced...2/3 people can split a large pizza and it comes to $22 total. - Also has exclusively vegetarian options...which is a win in my book :) - Overall one of the best pizzas I've had in the Bay."
10,"Been around for years so they don't need validation from me - but the place is clean,consistent and the food is amazing! The food, specifically, being that daily chef chosen pizza!"
11,"My cousin brought me a tub of ricotta last night.It's now 8:44am the following day..and it's almost gone.Ricotta, bread, breakfast.This is the ricotta in the metal tin that they put in a plastic tub for you. Not too sure of the producer.But, I'm in cheese heaven."
12,This place is a national treasure as I have not been there for a while and only downside is closed Sunday. It only gets better with age  and the brioche is better than ever and the cheese bread is cheesier. Best of its type in USA.
13,"People say it's much better than Sliver but I can't really say. The pizza is great, and I think the cilantro sauce is less salty. I love how thin the crust is. Good for vegetarians.The band performing was absolutely beautiful."
14,"This place is amazing. Great variety of cheeses and all sorts of delights to pair them with from fresh baked breads to delicious jams and whole honeycombs. Parking is a bit of a free for all and you'll likely have to pay to park in a lot unless you can find street parking off to the side somewhere.At the cheese counter, pick up a playing card and when your card is called you get one on one treatment from a cheese expert. They have you try each cheese before buying as the taste can vary from batch to batch and even among wheels. I'm a big cheese fan so it was hard not to love everything I tried but I particularly enjoyed both the Swiss and French raclette and a very creamy brie that I can't recall the name of but Vicky can tell you as it is one of her favorites which she suggested to me.Aside from the cheese, we always pick up a whole honeycomb and a seeded baguette. Also popular are their cheese rolls which are a tasty sourdough with delicious cheese globs baked into it. I do prefer the cheese rolls at Acme though, where the cheese is blended in the dough and every bite is elasticy cheesy bready goodness."
15,"Excellent pastries and cheeses. Can recommend the cheese bread, carrot muffin and the cornbread sconces. Delicious!"
16,"Like I said in my last review, I did come back to try more muffins and a few ""chocolate things""! It was around 7:30 AM on a Friday and the place was already busy, but not enough to have a line :)**After the success of the apple apricot muffin last time, I picked a carrot spice muffin which was full of raisins, golden raisins, nuts, and of course carrots. Would recommend! **The chocolate things were also amazing, they're full of huge chocolate chunks rather than maybe a swirl, and the bread itself is soft and chewy. Make sure to eat the chocolate things while they're warm (i.e. Heat them up the next day) because otherwise they get kind of hard. **Also picked up a few scones -- 1 berry/lemon and 1 berry/corn (yum!! Texture is a mix between cornbread and scone) --  which were good but TL;DR if you can only pick a few things I'd definitely go for a muffin or chocolate thing."
17,Tasty healthy vegan pizza! It's harf to believe it isnt real cheese! Definetly stop by for fresh and hot pizza if youre In the area =) they also serve organic soft serve. yummm!
18,Can't go wrong with a pizza from here and their green sauce. Line can seem intimidating but it moves fast! The pro of serving only one flavor a day. Seating can be a game of chance but I haven't had any issues the times I've been.
19,Have only been here once and never knew about this amazing place. I love simple concepts like this. One flavor of pizza each day. Stand in line. Get your slice. And eat. My boyfriend and I tried this place out because he loves pizza. I cannot recall what the pizza flavor was for the day but it was simple and didn't have any fancy cheeses or veggies on there. We grabbed about four slices and two glasses of wine. Sat at a table near the open windows. Listened the a live band play during dinner. And ended up sharing our table with a few strangers during the night.It was very casual. And comfortable. The food was great and the ambiance was chill. And it was cheap overall. They have a website if you don't want to be spontaneous. It displays their pizza flavor for the day. So if you want to know before you make the drive out there. It's convenient. Good luck! And don't forget to purchase the baked garlic. Yum!

53,"People say it's much better than Sliver but I can't really say. The pizza is great, and I think the cilantro sauce is less salty. I love how thin the crust is. Good for vegetarians.The band performing was absolutely beautiful."
54,"This place is amazing. Great variety of cheeses and all sorts of delights to pair them with from fresh baked breads to delicious jams and whole honeycombs. Parking is a bit of a free for all and you'll likely have to pay to park in a lot unless you can find street parking off to the side somewhere.At the cheese counter, pick up a playing card and when your card is called you get one on one treatment from a cheese expert. They have you try each cheese before buying as the taste can vary from batch to batch and even among wheels. I'm a big cheese fan so it was hard not to love everything I tried but I particularly enjoyed both the Swiss and French raclette and a very creamy brie that I can't recall the name of but Vicky can tell you as it is one of her favorites which she suggested to me.Aside from the cheese, we always pick up a whole honeycomb and a seeded baguette. Also popular are their cheese rolls which are a tasty sourdough with delicious cheese globs baked into it. I do prefer the cheese rolls at Acme though, where the cheese is blended in the dough and every bite is elasticy cheesy bready goodness."
55,"Excellent pastries and cheeses. Can recommend the cheese bread, carrot muffin and the cornbread sconces. Delicious!"
56,"Like I said in my last review, I did come back to try more muffins and a few ""chocolate things""! It was around 7:30 AM on a Friday and the place was already busy, but not enough to have a line :)**After the success of the apple apricot muffin last time, I picked a carrot spice muffin which was full of raisins, golden raisins, nuts, and of course carrots. Would recommend! **The chocolate things were also amazing, they're full of huge chocolate chunks rather than maybe a swirl, and the bread itself is soft and chewy. Make sure to eat the chocolate things while they're warm (i.e. Heat them up the next day) because otherwise they get kind of hard. **Also picked up a few scones -- 1 berry/lemon and 1 berry/corn (yum!! Texture is a mix between cornbread and scone) --  which were good but TL;DR if you can only pick a few things I'd definitely go for a muffin or chocolate thing."
57,Tasty healthy vegan pizza! It's harf to believe it isnt real cheese! Definetly stop by for fresh and hot pizza if youre In the area =) they also serve organic soft serve. yummm!
58,Can't go wrong with a pizza from here and their green sauce. Line can seem intimidating but it moves fast! The pro of serving only one flavor a day. Seating can be a game of chance but I haven't had any issues the times I've been.
59,Have only been here once and never knew about this amazing place. I love simple concepts like this. One flavor of pizza each day. Stand in line. Get your slice. And eat. My boyfriend and I tried this place out because he loves pizza. I cannot recall what the pizza flavor was for the day but it was simple and didn't have any fancy cheeses or veggies on there. We grabbed about four slices and two glasses of wine. Sat at a table near the open windows. Listened the a live band play during dinner. And ended up sharing our table with a few strangers during the night.It was very casual. And comfortable. The food was great and the ambiance was chill. And it was cheap overall. They have a website if you don't want to be spontaneous. It displays their pizza flavor for the day. So if you want to know before you make the drive out there. It's convenient. Good luck! And don't forget to purchase the baked garlic. Yum!
60,"If you're here with family, friends, with two, solo, just buy the whole dang pizza because you'll regret not having the chance to scarf it down. Sure, you might have leftovers- take it home and freeze if it makes it until the next day. Or you can stand in line again for another half; the line is terribly long down the street, but the place is so efficient it will only take minutes. This pizza is good because of the dough. The dough is good because it is, in essence, bread. Good bread. Bread that can be eaten without the fripperies of tomato sauce, cheese, and whatever one topping they decide to do for the day. But they add this stuff to the good bread and it becomes a lovely pizza."
61,"When I told my LA friends I was heading up to Berkeley, two said this was the ""best"" place and that I ""must go."" They raved about the eggplant topping. Wait time & seating: Came around 2pm on a Saturday and the line took us about 20-30minutes. There is an incredibly limited amount of seating for the amount of people who come by, so get to praying before you arrive. We lucked out with seats by the live band, which was neat but made it difficult to talk without yelling. Pizza comes out incredibly fast, because they only serve one type per day. Food: I'm personally a fan of thicker, chewier crusts, so this was disappointing and didn't amount to the hype it received. It was average pizza with average, unmemorable toppings (the day I went). It's probably better other days, but not a fan of the ""take your chance"" game if I'm craving pizza one day. Price: For $24 (after tax), the pizza certainly wasn't worth it. More of a hype place, based on that day's pizza."
62,"I've heard about the Cheese Board from multiple friends for a long time but have not tried it until last week. We arrived around 11am and there were already a lot of people there because the bakery/cheese side is open by 8am. Even though the pizza side doesn't open until 11:30, there were already a lot of people waiting around for it. I recommend getting there early if you want to avoid a wait. People start to form an official line as soon as they open at 11:30.I didn't try and of the cheese but the bakery side had lots of good bread and baked goods options. We ended up buying the Sunday Bread, scone, chocolate things, and the Ginger Molasses cookie. All of them were really good! The Sunday bread and chocolate things can be a bit dense and dry if you eat it the next day but I found microwaving them to be a good way to enjoy them :) I found out that the Cheese Board only makes one flavor a day. The pizza of the day was with roasted potatoes (carbs on carbs), caramelized onions, mozzarella, and cave aged gruyere, cheese, garlic olive oil, parsley, and oregano. Even though they only make one flavor a day they do have vegan options. The pizzas were very reasonably priced, at $3 slice. When I got the pizza it was  burning hot, which is not necessarily a bad thing but I found it hard to even leave it on my lap when I was trying to eat it in their outdoor seating area. Even though I'm not usually a pizza fan, I enjoyed the pizza here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the area again.Pros:- Bakery and Cheese shop open early, can shop there while waiting for the pizza- Half baked pizza available at the bakery- Fresh pizza - Vegetarian and Vegan optionsCons:- Only one flavor so if you don't like it then there's not much of an alternative- Long lines and really crowded - Staffs are not the friendliest people, don't really bother to greet you or even smile- Pizza on the oily size so make sure to grab napkins!"
63,"If you a cheese lover, you have to come here. They have so many cheeses I didn't even know existed.They also have a large variety of breads, though not as extravagant as their cheese selection. I got 6 English muffins for $5.50. I'm not a big fan of English muffins, but they were the best English muffins I've ever had. I ate one right when I got them, and put the rest in the fridge hoping they would still be fluffy. When I took them out of the fridge, they were rock hard, but I popped them in the fridge. Like magic, they were back to the soft soft fluffy English muffins they were the day before. So far, I haven't tried anything else, but am definitely going to go back and try their other breads and cheeses.**note: If you are looking for pizza, it's next door. I accidentally came in here because I was in a hurry and saw the word cheese and thought this was Cheese Board Pizza. (silly me)TL;DR Cheese heaven"
64,"Good selection of cheese, bread and other sweet and savory snacks.  Coffee is decent. The sweet goodies aren't that sugary, which is a good thing for me. Store hours are short. Staff is polite but don't not friendly enough to spend much time with you explaining about the products."
65,"Wow, an array of cheeses and it was packed on a Saturday afternoon! I snuck into the bread line and got two cheese breads, a wolverine, and an olive focaccia bread. Only had the cheese breads, and my friend loved the burnt cheese all over it. It was a little too burnt and crunch for me, but it was really delicious! Fresh and warm out of the oven! Prices are really fair as well."
66,"Before there was Cheese Board Pizza there was the Cheese Board Collective.  They've been in Berkeley since 1967 and were, along w/ Peet's, the beginnings of the Gourmet Ghetto.  They became a worker owned co-op in 1971.  They were one of the first cheese shops I encountered as a young woman and they were probably the first bakery in Berkeley to make a proper baguette w/ the authentic texture.  In the beginning they were a cool little shop and over the decades they have grown into a powerhouse.  They still sell a wide variety of cheeses, but they also sell a rotating range of baked goods, most savory and some sweet and their iconic pizza.  The pizza is sold half baked to take home or ready to eat slices to eat there, or on the median strip, despite the signs.  We check their pizza offerings, which change daily, online and buy half a pizza to bake for dinner when it sounds good.  I have a separate review for Cheese Board Pizza, which has become our preferred pizza source because of their imaginative combinations.  The Cheese Board also has live music, one group at lunch, another at dinner, which is very cool"
67,"Even with the storm, this doesn't seem to deter the huge crowds on a Saturday morning wanting their gluten fix. Came here with the intent of buying some cheese, but ended up with a bag of baked goods, pizza, and their green sauce.  I'm obsessed with their green sauce, and will slather it on everything possible! So excited that the cheese shop carries them here for $4/container. They have tons of local and international cheeses, with samples available. They also carry Cowgirl Creamery! My favs: cheese rolls, provolone olive roll, and all their Cowgirl Creamery cheeses PRO TIP: They sell their half baked pizzas at the bakery as well, if you want to avoid the lines at their restaurant next door. However, there's lines here too, but they move quick!"
68,"It was my very first time here yesterday and I was shocked at how many people were waiting in line for this pizza. I thought to myself, wow is it really that good? Lol well it definitely was tasty! I've never had a pizza like this! The flavor was so tangy and delicious definitely worth the 25 min wait!"
69,"- Had a special ""Pride Celebration"" pizza... Heirloom tomato, red onion, mozzarella and aged Asiago cheese, garlic olive oil, parsley, oregano. Highly recommend it.- A little on the cheesy side for my own liking...but thats to be expected given the name, and the cheese was amazing. - Very reasonably priced...2/3 people can split a large pizza and it comes to $22 total. - Also has exclusively vegetarian options...which is a win in my book :) - Overall one of the best pizzas I've had in the Bay."

I accidentally came in here because I was in a hurry and saw the word cheese and thought this was Cheese Board Pizza. (silly me)TL;DR Cheese heaven"
104,"Good selection of cheese, bread and other sweet and savory snacks.  Coffee is decent. The sweet goodies aren't that sugary, which is a good thing for me. Store hours are short. Staff is polite but don't not friendly enough to spend much time with you explaining about the products."
105,"Wow, an array of cheeses and it was packed on a Saturday afternoon! I snuck into the bread line and got two cheese breads, a wolverine, and an olive focaccia bread. Only had the cheese breads, and my friend loved the burnt cheese all over it. It was a little too burnt and crunch for me, but it was really delicious! Fresh and warm out of the oven! Prices are really fair as well."
106,"Before there was Cheese Board Pizza there was the Cheese Board Collective.  They've been in Berkeley since 1967 and were, along w/ Peet's, the beginnings of the Gourmet Ghetto.  They became a worker owned co-op in 1971.  They were one of the first cheese shops I encountered as a young woman and they were probably the first bakery in Berkeley to make a proper baguette w/ the authentic texture.  In the beginning they were a cool little shop and over the decades they have grown into a powerhouse.  They still sell a wide variety of cheeses, but they also sell a rotating range of baked goods, most savory and some sweet and their iconic pizza.  The pizza is sold half baked to take home or ready to eat slices to eat there, or on the median strip, despite the signs.  We check their pizza offerings, which change daily, online and buy half a pizza to bake for dinner when it sounds good.  I have a separate review for Cheese Board Pizza, which has become our preferred pizza source because of their imaginative combinations.  The Cheese Board also has live music, one group at lunch, another at dinner, which is very cool"
107,"Even with the storm, this doesn't seem to deter the huge crowds on a Saturday morning wanting their gluten fix. Came here with the intent of buying some cheese, but ended up with a bag of baked goods, pizza, and their green sauce.  I'm obsessed with their green sauce, and will slather it on everything possible! So excited that the cheese shop carries them here for $4/container. They have tons of local and international cheeses, with samples available. They also carry Cowgirl Creamery! My favs: cheese rolls, provolone olive roll, and all their Cowgirl Creamery cheeses PRO TIP: They sell their half baked pizzas at the bakery as well, if you want to avoid the lines at their restaurant next door. However, there's lines here too, but they move quick!"
108,"It was my very first time here yesterday and I was shocked at how many people were waiting in line for this pizza. I thought to myself, wow is it really that good? Lol well it definitely was tasty! I've never had a pizza like this! The flavor was so tangy and delicious definitely worth the 25 min wait!"
109,"- Had a special ""Pride Celebration"" pizza... Heirloom tomato, red onion, mozzarella and aged Asiago cheese, garlic olive oil, parsley, oregano. Highly recommend it.- A little on the cheesy side for my own liking...but thats to be expected given the name, and the cheese was amazing. - Very reasonably priced...2/3 people can split a large pizza and it comes to $22 total. - Also has exclusively vegetarian options...which is a win in my book :) - Overall one of the best pizzas I've had in the Bay."
110,"Been around for years so they don't need validation from me - but the place is clean,consistent and the food is amazing! The food, specifically, being that daily chef chosen pizza!"
111,"My cousin brought me a tub of ricotta last night.It's now 8:44am the following day..and it's almost gone.Ricotta, bread, breakfast.This is the ricotta in the metal tin that they put in a plastic tub for you. Not too sure of the producer.But, I'm in cheese heaven."
112,This place is a national treasure as I have not been there for a while and only downside is closed Sunday. It only gets better with age  and the brioche is better than ever and the cheese bread is cheesier. Best of its type in USA.
113,"People say it's much better than Sliver but I can't really say. The pizza is great, and I think the cilantro sauce is less salty. I love how thin the crust is. Good for vegetarians.The band performing was absolutely beautiful."
114,"This place is amazing. Great variety of cheeses and all sorts of delights to pair them with from fresh baked breads to delicious jams and whole honeycombs. Parking is a bit of a free for all and you'll likely have to pay to park in a lot unless you can find street parking off to the side somewhere.At the cheese counter, pick up a playing card and when your card is called you get one on one treatment from a cheese expert. They have you try each cheese before buying as the taste can vary from batch to batch and even among wheels. I'm a big cheese fan so it was hard not to love everything I tried but I particularly enjoyed both the Swiss and French raclette and a very creamy brie that I can't recall the name of but Vicky can tell you as it is one of her favorites which she suggested to me.Aside from the cheese, we always pick up a whole honeycomb and a seeded baguette. Also popular are their cheese rolls which are a tasty sourdough with delicious cheese globs baked into it. I do prefer the cheese rolls at Acme though, where the cheese is blended in the dough and every bite is elasticy cheesy bready goodness."
115,"Excellent pastries and cheeses. Can recommend the cheese bread, carrot muffin and the cornbread sconces. Delicious!"
116,"Like I said in my last review, I did come back to try more muffins and a few ""chocolate things""! It was around 7:30 AM on a Friday and the place was already busy, but not enough to have a line :)**After the success of the apple apricot muffin last time, I picked a carrot spice muffin which was full of raisins, golden raisins, nuts, and of course carrots. Would recommend! **The chocolate things were also amazing, they're full of huge chocolate chunks rather than maybe a swirl, and the bread itself is soft and chewy. Make sure to eat the chocolate things while they're warm (i.e. Heat them up the next day) because otherwise they get kind of hard. **Also picked up a few scones -- 1 berry/lemon and 1 berry/corn (yum!! Texture is a mix between cornbread and scone) --  which were good but TL;DR if you can only pick a few things I'd definitely go for a muffin or chocolate thing."
117,Tasty healthy vegan pizza! It's harf to believe it isnt real cheese! Definetly stop by for fresh and hot pizza if youre In the area =) they also serve organic soft serve. yummm!
118,Can't go wrong with a pizza from here and their green sauce. Line can seem intimidating but it moves fast! The pro of serving only one flavor a day. Seating can be a game of chance but I haven't had any issues the times I've been.
119,Have only been here once and never knew about this amazing place. I love simple concepts like this. One flavor of pizza each day. Stand in line. Get your slice. And eat. My boyfriend and I tried this place out because he loves pizza. I cannot recall what the pizza flavor was for the day but it was simple and didn't have any fancy cheeses or veggies on there. We grabbed about four slices and two glasses of wine. Sat at a table near the open windows. Listened the a live band play during dinner. And ended up sharing our table with a few strangers during the night.It was very casual. And comfortable. The food was great and the ambiance was chill. And it was cheap overall. They have a website if you don't want to be spontaneous. It displays their pizza flavor for the day. So if you want to know before you make the drive out there. It's convenient. Good luck! And don't forget to purchase the baked garlic. Yum!
120,"If you're here with family, friends, with two, solo, just buy the whole dang pizza because you'll regret not having the chance to scarf it down. Sure, you might have leftovers- take it home and freeze if it makes it until the next day. Or you can stand in line again for another half; the line is terribly long down the street, but the place is so efficient it will only take minutes. This pizza is good because of the dough. The dough is good because it is, in essence, bread. Good bread. Bread that can be eaten without the fripperies of tomato sauce, cheese, and whatever one topping they decide to do for the day. But they add this stuff to the good bread and it becomes a lovely pizza."
121,"When I told my LA friends I was heading up to Berkeley, two said this was the ""best"" place and that I ""must go."" They raved about the eggplant topping. Wait time & seating: Came around 2pm on a Saturday and the line took us about 20-30minutes. There is an incredibly limited amount of seating for the amount of people who come by, so get to praying before you arrive. We lucked out with seats by the live band, which was neat but made it difficult to talk without yelling. Pizza comes out incredibly fast, because they only serve one type per day. Food: I'm personally a fan of thicker, chewier crusts, so this was disappointing and didn't amount to the hype it received. It was average pizza with average, unmemorable toppings (the day I went). It's probably better other days, but not a fan of the ""take your chance"" game if I'm craving pizza one day. Price: For $24 (after tax), the pizza certainly wasn't worth it. More of a hype place, based on that day's pizza."
122,"I've heard about the Cheese Board from multiple friends for a long time but have not tried it until last week. We arrived around 11am and there were already a lot of people there because the bakery/cheese side is open by 8am. Even though the pizza side doesn't open until 11:30, there were already a lot of people waiting around for it. I recommend getting there early if you want to avoid a wait. People start to form an official line as soon as they open at 11:30.I didn't try and of the cheese but the bakery side had lots of good bread and baked goods options. We ended up buying the Sunday Bread, scone, chocolate things, and the Ginger Molasses cookie. All of them were really good! The Sunday bread and chocolate things can be a bit dense and dry if you eat it the next day but I found microwaving them to be a good way to enjoy them :) I found out that the Cheese Board only makes one flavor a day. The pizza of the day was with roasted potatoes (carbs on carbs), caramelized onions, mozzarella, and cave aged gruyere, cheese, garlic olive oil, parsley, and oregano. Even though they only make one flavor a day they do have vegan options. The pizzas were very reasonably priced, at $3 slice. When I got the pizza it was  burning hot, which is not necessarily a bad thing but I found it hard to even leave it on my lap when I was trying to eat it in their outdoor seating area. Even though I'm not usually a pizza fan, I enjoyed the pizza here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the area again.Pros:- Bakery and Cheese shop open early, can shop there while waiting for the pizza- Half baked pizza available at the bakery- Fresh pizza - Vegetarian and Vegan optionsCons:- Only one flavor so if you don't like it then there's not much of an alternative- Long lines and really crowded - Staffs are not the friendliest people, don't really bother to greet you or even smile- Pizza on the oily size so make sure to grab napkins!"
123,"If you a cheese lover, you have to come here. They have so many cheeses I didn't even know existed.They also have a large variety of breads, though not as extravagant as their cheese selection. I got 6 English muffins for $5.50. I'm not a big fan of English muffins, but they were the best English muffins I've ever had. I ate one right when I got them, and put the rest in the fridge hoping they would still be fluffy. When I took them out of the fridge, they were rock hard, but I popped them in the fridge. Like magic, they were back to the soft soft fluffy English muffins they were the day before. So far, I haven't tried anything else, but am definitely going to go back and try their other breads and cheeses.**note: If you are looking for pizza, it's next door.

The dough is good because it is, in essence, bread. Good bread. Bread that can be eaten without the fripperies of tomato sauce, cheese, and whatever one topping they decide to do for the day. But they add this stuff to the good bread and it becomes a lovely pizza."

Wait time & seating: Came around 2pm on a Saturday and the line took us about 20-30minutes. There is an incredibly limited amount of seating for the amount of people who come by, so get to praying before you arrive. We lucked out with seats by the live band, which was neat but made it difficult to talk without yelling. Pizza comes out incredibly fast, because they only serve one type per day. Food: I'm personally a fan of thicker, chewier crusts, so this was disappointing and didn't amount to the hype it received. It was average pizza with average, unmemorable toppings (the day I went). It's probably better other days, but not a fan of the ""take your chance"" game if I'm craving pizza one day. Price: For $24 (after tax), the pizza certainly wasn't worth it.

162,"I've heard about the Cheese Board from multiple friends for a long time but have not tried it until last week. We arrived around 11am and there were already a lot of people there because the bakery/cheese side is open by 8am. Even though the pizza side doesn't open until 11:30, there were already a lot of people waiting around for it. I recommend getting there early if you want to avoid a wait. People start to form an official line as soon as they open at 11:30.I didn't try and of the cheese but the bakery side had lots of good bread and baked goods options. We ended up buying the Sunday Bread, scone, chocolate things, and the Ginger Molasses cookie. All of them were really good! The Sunday bread and chocolate things can be a bit dense and dry if you eat it the next day but I found microwaving them to be a good way to enjoy them :) I found out that the Cheese Board only makes one flavor a day. The pizza of the day was with roasted potatoes (carbs on carbs), caramelized onions, mozzarella, and cave aged gruyere, cheese, garlic olive oil, parsley, and oregano. Even though they only make one flavor a day they do have vegan options. The pizzas were very reasonably priced, at $3 slice. When I got the pizza it was  burning hot, which is not necessarily a bad thing but I found it hard to even leave it on my lap when I was trying to eat it in their outdoor seating area. Even though I'm not usually a pizza fan, I enjoyed the pizza here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the area again.Pros:- Bakery and Cheese shop open early, can shop there while waiting for the pizza- Half baked pizza available at the bakery- Fresh pizza - Vegetarian and Vegan optionsCons:- Only one flavor so if you don't like it then there's not much of an alternative- Long lines and really crowded - Staffs are not the friendliest people, don't really bother to greet you or even smile- Pizza on the oily size so make sure to grab napkins!"
163,"If you a cheese lover, you have to come here. They have so many cheeses I didn't even know existed.They also have a large variety of breads, though not as extravagant as their cheese selection. I got 6 English muffins for $5.50. I'm not a big fan of English muffins, but they were the best English muffins I've ever had. I ate one right when I got them, and put the rest in the fridge hoping they would still be fluffy. When I took them out of the fridge, they were rock hard, but I popped them in the fridge. Like magic, they were back to the soft soft fluffy English muffins they were the day before. So far, I haven't tried anything else, but am definitely going to go back and try their other breads and cheeses.**note: If you are looking for pizza, it's next door. I accidentally came in here because I was in a hurry and saw the word cheese and thought this was Cheese Board Pizza. (silly me)TL;DR Cheese heaven"
164,"Good selection of cheese, bread and other sweet and savory snacks.  Coffee is decent. The sweet goodies aren't that sugary, which is a good thing for me. Store hours are short. Staff is polite but don't not friendly enough to spend much time with you explaining about the products."
165,"Wow, an array of cheeses and it was packed on a Saturday afternoon! I snuck into the bread line and got two cheese breads, a wolverine, and an olive focaccia bread. Only had the cheese breads, and my friend loved the burnt cheese all over it. It was a little too burnt and crunch for me, but it was really delicious! Fresh and warm out of the oven! Prices are really fair as well."
166,"Before there was Cheese Board Pizza there was the Cheese Board Collective.  They've been in Berkeley since 1967 and were, along w/ Peet's, the beginnings of the Gourmet Ghetto.  They became a worker owned co-op in 1971.  They were one of the first cheese shops I encountered as a young woman and they were probably the first bakery in Berkeley to make a proper baguette w/ the authentic texture.  In the beginning they were a cool little shop and over the decades they have grown into a powerhouse.  They still sell a wide variety of cheeses, but they also sell a rotating range of baked goods, most savory and some sweet and their iconic pizza.  The pizza is sold half baked to take home or ready to eat slices to eat there, or on the median strip, despite the signs.  We check their pizza offerings, which change daily, online and buy half a pizza to bake for dinner when it sounds good.  I have a separate review for Cheese Board Pizza, which has become our preferred pizza source because of their imaginative combinations.  The Cheese Board also has live music, one group at lunch, another at dinner, which is very cool"
167,"Even with the storm, this doesn't seem to deter the huge crowds on a Saturday morning wanting their gluten fix. Came here with the intent of buying some cheese, but ended up with a bag of baked goods, pizza, and their green sauce.  I'm obsessed with their green sauce, and will slather it on everything possible! So excited that the cheese shop carries them here for $4/container. They have tons of local and international cheeses, with samples available. They also carry Cowgirl Creamery! My favs: cheese rolls, provolone olive roll, and all their Cowgirl Creamery cheeses PRO TIP: They sell their half baked pizzas at the bakery as well, if you want to avoid the lines at their restaurant next door. However, there's lines here too, but they move quick!"
168,"It was my very first time here yesterday and I was shocked at how many people were waiting in line for this pizza. I thought to myself, wow is it really that good? Lol well it definitely was tasty! I've never had a pizza like this! The flavor was so tangy and delicious definitely worth the 25 min wait!"
169,"- Had a special ""Pride Celebration"" pizza... Heirloom tomato, red onion, mozzarella and aged Asiago cheese, garlic olive oil, parsley, oregano. Highly recommend it.- A little on the cheesy side for my own liking...but thats to be expected given the name, and the cheese was amazing. - Very reasonably priced...2/3 people can split a large pizza and it comes to $22 total. - Also has exclusively vegetarian options...which is a win in my book :) - Overall one of the best pizzas I've had in the Bay."
170,"Been around for years so they don't need validation from me - but the place is clean,consistent and the food is amazing! The food, specifically, being that daily chef chosen pizza!"
171,"My cousin brought me a tub of ricotta last night.It's now 8:44am the following day..and it's almost gone.Ricotta, bread, breakfast.This is the ricotta in the metal tin that they put in a plastic tub for you. Not too sure of the producer.But, I'm in cheese heaven."
172,This place is a national treasure as I have not been there for a while and only downside is closed Sunday. It only gets better with age  and the brioche is better than ever and the cheese bread is cheesier. Best of its type in USA.
173,"People say it's much better than Sliver but I can't really say. The pizza is great, and I think the cilantro sauce is less salty. I love how thin the crust is. Good for vegetarians.The band performing was absolutely beautiful."
174,"This place is amazing. Great variety of cheeses and all sorts of delights to pair them with from fresh baked breads to delicious jams and whole honeycombs. Parking is a bit of a free for all and you'll likely have to pay to park in a lot unless you can find street parking off to the side somewhere.At the cheese counter, pick up a playing card and when your card is called you get one on one treatment from a cheese expert. They have you try each cheese before buying as the taste can vary from batch to batch and even among wheels. I'm a big cheese fan so it was hard not to love everything I tried but I particularly enjoyed both the Swiss and French raclette and a very creamy brie that I can't recall the name of but Vicky can tell you as it is one of her favorites which she suggested to me.Aside from the cheese, we always pick up a whole honeycomb and a seeded baguette. Also popular are their cheese rolls which are a tasty sourdough with delicious cheese globs baked into it. I do prefer the cheese rolls at Acme though, where the cheese is blended in the dough and every bite is elasticy cheesy bready goodness."
175,"Excellent pastries and cheeses. Can recommend the cheese bread, carrot muffin and the cornbread sconces. Delicious!"
176,"Like I said in my last review, I did come back to try more muffins and a few ""chocolate things""! It was around 7:30 AM on a Friday and the place was already busy, but not enough to have a line :)**After the success of the apple apricot muffin last time, I picked a carrot spice muffin which was full of raisins, golden raisins, nuts, and of course carrots. Would recommend! **The chocolate things were also amazing, they're full of huge chocolate chunks rather than maybe a swirl, and the bread itself is soft and chewy. Make sure to eat the chocolate things while they're warm (i.e. Heat them up the next day) because otherwise they get kind of hard. **Also picked up a few scones -- 1 berry/lemon and 1 berry/corn (yum!! Texture is a mix between cornbread and scone) --  which were good but TL;DR if you can only pick a few things I'd definitely go for a muffin or chocolate thing."
177,Tasty healthy vegan pizza! It's harf to believe it isnt real cheese! Definetly stop by for fresh and hot pizza if youre In the area =) they also serve organic soft serve. yummm!
178,Can't go wrong with a pizza from here and their green sauce. Line can seem intimidating but it moves fast! The pro of serving only one flavor a day. Seating can be a game of chance but I haven't had any issues the times I've been.
179,Have only been here once and never knew about this amazing place. I love simple concepts like this. One flavor of pizza each day. Stand in line. Get your slice. And eat. My boyfriend and I tried this place out because he loves pizza. I cannot recall what the pizza flavor was for the day but it was simple and didn't have any fancy cheeses or veggies on there. We grabbed about four slices and two glasses of wine. Sat at a table near the open windows. Listened the a live band play during dinner. And ended up sharing our table with a few strangers during the night.It was very casual. And comfortable. The food was great and the ambiance was chill. And it was cheap overall. They have a website if you don't want to be spontaneous. It displays their pizza flavor for the day. So if you want to know before you make the drive out there. It's convenient. Good luck! And don't forget to purchase the baked garlic. Yum!
180,"If you're here with family, friends, with two, solo, just buy the whole dang pizza because you'll regret not having the chance to scarf it down.

213,"People say it's much better than Sliver but I can't really say. The pizza is great, and I think the cilantro sauce is less salty. I love how thin the crust is. Good for vegetarians.The band performing was absolutely beautiful."
214,"This place is amazing. Great variety of cheeses and all sorts of delights to pair them with from fresh baked breads to delicious jams and whole honeycombs. Parking is a bit of a free for all and you'll likely have to pay to park in a lot unless you can find street parking off to the side somewhere.At the cheese counter, pick up a playing card and when your card is called you get one on one treatment from a cheese expert.

I'm a big cheese fan so it was hard not to love everything I tried but I particularly enjoyed both the Swiss and French raclette and a very creamy brie that I can't recall the name of but Vicky can tell you as it is one of her favorites which she suggested to me.Aside from the cheese, we always pick up a whole honeycomb and a seeded baguette. Also popular are their cheese rolls which are a tasty sourdough with delicious cheese globs baked into it. I do prefer the cheese rolls at Acme though, where the cheese is blended in the dough and every bite is elasticy cheesy bready goodness."
215,"Excellent pastries and cheeses. Can recommend the cheese bread, carrot muffin and the cornbread sconces. Delicious!"
216,"Like I said in my last review, I did come back to try more muffins and a few ""chocolate things""! It was around 7:30 AM on a Friday and the place was already busy, but not enough to have a line :)**After the success of the apple apricot muffin last time, I picked a carrot spice muffin which was full of raisins, golden raisins, nuts, and of course carrots. Would recommend! **The chocolate things were also amazing, they're full of huge chocolate chunks rather than maybe a swirl, and the bread itself is soft and chewy. Make sure to eat the chocolate things while they're warm (i.e. Heat them up the next day) because otherwise they get kind of hard. **Also picked up a few scones -- 1 berry/lemon and 1 berry/corn (yum!! Texture is a mix between cornbread and scone) --  which were good but TL;DR if you can only pick a few things I'd definitely go for a muffin or chocolate thing."
217,Tasty healthy vegan pizza! It's harf to believe it isnt real cheese! Definetly stop by for fresh and hot pizza if youre In the area =) they also serve organic soft serve. yummm!
218,Can't go wrong with a pizza from here and their green sauce. Line can seem intimidating but it moves fast! The pro of serving only one flavor a day. Seating can be a game of chance but I haven't had any issues the times I've been.
219,Have only been here once and never knew about this amazing place. I love simple concepts like this. One flavor of pizza each day. Stand in line. Get your slice. And eat. My boyfriend and I tried this place out because he loves pizza. I cannot recall what the pizza flavor was for the day but it was simple and didn't have any fancy cheeses or veggies on there. We grabbed about four slices and two glasses of wine. Sat at a table near the open windows. Listened the a live band play during dinner. And ended up sharing our table with a few strangers during the night.It was very casual. And comfortable. The food was great and the ambiance was chill. And it was cheap overall. They have a website if you don't want to be spontaneous. It displays their pizza flavor for the day. So if you want to know before you make the drive out there. It's convenient. Good luck! And don't forget to purchase the baked garlic. Yum!
220,"If you're here with family, friends, with two, solo, just buy the whole dang pizza because you'll regret not having the chance to scarf it down. Sure, you might have leftovers- take it home and freeze if it makes it until the next day. Or you can stand in line again for another half; the line is terribly long down the street, but the place is so efficient it will only take minutes. This pizza is good because of the dough. The dough is good because it is, in essence, bread. Good bread. Bread that can be eaten without the fripperies of tomato sauce, cheese, and whatever one topping they decide to do for the day. But they add this stuff to the good bread and it becomes a lovely pizza."
221,"When I told my LA friends I was heading up to Berkeley, two said this was the ""best"" place and that I ""must go."" They raved about the eggplant topping. Wait time & seating: Came around 2pm on a Saturday and the line took us about 20-30minutes. There is an incredibly limited amount of seating for the amount of people who come by, so get to praying before you arrive. We lucked out with seats by the live band, which was neat but made it difficult to talk without yelling. Pizza comes out incredibly fast, because they only serve one type per day. Food: I'm personally a fan of thicker, chewier crusts, so this was disappointing and didn't amount to the hype it received. It was average pizza with average, unmemorable toppings (the day I went). It's probably better other days, but not a fan of the ""take your chance"" game if I'm craving pizza one day. Price: For $24 (after tax), the pizza certainly wasn't worth it. More of a hype place, based on that day's pizza."
222,"I've heard about the Cheese Board from multiple friends for a long time but have not tried it until last week. We arrived around 11am and there were already a lot of people there because the bakery/cheese side is open by 8am. Even though the pizza side doesn't open until 11:30, there were already a lot of people waiting around for it. I recommend getting there early if you want to avoid a wait. People start to form an official line as soon as they open at 11:30.I didn't try and of the cheese but the bakery side had lots of good bread and baked goods options. We ended up buying the Sunday Bread, scone, chocolate things, and the Ginger Molasses cookie. All of them were really good! The Sunday bread and chocolate things can be a bit dense and dry if you eat it the next day but I found microwaving them to be a good way to enjoy them :) I found out that the Cheese Board only makes one flavor a day. The pizza of the day was with roasted potatoes (carbs on carbs), caramelized onions, mozzarella, and cave aged gruyere, cheese, garlic olive oil, parsley, and oregano. Even though they only make one flavor a day they do have vegan options. The pizzas were very reasonably priced, at $3 slice. When I got the pizza it was  burning hot, which is not necessarily a bad thing but I found it hard to even leave it on my lap when I was trying to eat it in their outdoor seating area. Even though I'm not usually a pizza fan, I enjoyed the pizza here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the area again.Pros:- Bakery and Cheese shop open early, can shop there while waiting for the pizza- Half baked pizza available at the bakery- Fresh pizza - Vegetarian and Vegan optionsCons:- Only one flavor so if you don't like it then there's not much of an alternative- Long lines and really crowded - Staffs are not the friendliest people, don't really bother to greet you or even smile- Pizza on the oily size so make sure to grab napkins!"
223,"If you a cheese lover, you have to come here. They have so many cheeses I didn't even know existed.They also have a large variety of breads, though not as extravagant as their cheese selection. I got 6 English muffins for $5.50. I'm not a big fan of English muffins, but they were the best English muffins I've ever had. I ate one right when I got them, and put the rest in the fridge hoping they would still be fluffy. When I took them out of the fridge, they were rock hard, but I popped them in the fridge. Like magic, they were back to the soft soft fluffy English muffins they were the day before. So far, I haven't tried anything else, but am definitely going to go back and try their other breads and cheeses.**note: If you are looking for pizza, it's next door. I accidentally came in here because I was in a hurry and saw the word cheese and thought this was Cheese Board Pizza. (silly me)TL;DR Cheese heaven"
224,"Good selection of cheese, bread and other sweet and savory snacks.  Coffee is decent. The sweet goodies aren't that sugary, which is a good thing for me. Store hours are short. Staff is polite but don't not friendly enough to spend much time with you explaining about the products."
225,"Wow, an array of cheeses and it was packed on a Saturday afternoon! I snuck into the bread line and got two cheese breads, a wolverine, and an olive focaccia bread. Only had the cheese breads, and my friend loved the burnt cheese all over it. It was a little too burnt and crunch for me, but it was really delicious! Fresh and warm out of the oven! Prices are really fair as well."
226,"Before there was Cheese Board Pizza there was the Cheese Board Collective.  They've been in Berkeley since 1967 and were, along w/ Peet's, the beginnings of the Gourmet Ghetto.  They became a worker owned co-op in 1971.  They were one of the first cheese shops I encountered as a young woman and they were probably the first bakery in Berkeley to make a proper baguette w/ the authentic texture.  In the beginning they were a cool little shop and over the decades they have grown into a powerhouse.  They still sell a wide variety of cheeses, but they also sell a rotating range of baked goods, most savory and some sweet and their iconic pizza.  The pizza is sold half baked to take home or ready to eat slices to eat there, or on the median strip, despite the signs.  We check their pizza offerings, which change daily, online and buy half a pizza to bake for dinner when it sounds good.  I have a separate review for Cheese Board Pizza, which has become our preferred pizza source because of their imaginative combinations.  The Cheese Board also has live music, one group at lunch, another at dinner, which is very cool"
227,"Even with the storm, this doesn't seem to deter the huge crowds on a Saturday morning wanting their gluten fix. Came here with the intent of buying some cheese, but ended up with a bag of baked goods, pizza, and their green sauce.  I'm obsessed with their green sauce, and will slather it on everything possible! So excited that the cheese shop carries them here for $4/container. They have tons of local and international cheeses, with samples available. They also carry Cowgirl Creamery! My favs: cheese rolls, provolone olive roll, and all their Cowgirl Creamery cheeses PRO TIP: They sell their half baked pizzas at the bakery as well, if you want to avoid the lines at their restaurant next door. However, there's lines here too, but they move quick!"
228,"It was my very first time here yesterday and I was shocked at how many people were waiting in line for this pizza. I thought to myself, wow is it really that good? Lol well it definitely was tasty! I've never had a pizza like this! The flavor was so tangy and delicious definitely worth the 25 min wait!"
229,"- Had a special ""Pride Celebration"" pizza... Heirloom tomato, red onion, mozzarella and aged Asiago cheese, garlic olive oil, parsley, oregano. Highly recommend it.- A little on the cheesy side for my own liking...but thats to be expected given the name, and the cheese was amazing. - Very reasonably priced...2/3 people can split a large pizza and it comes to $22 total. - Also has exclusively vegetarian options...which is a win in my book :) - Overall one of the best pizzas I've had in the Bay."

264,"Good selection of cheese, bread and other sweet and savory snacks.  Coffee is decent. The sweet goodies aren't that sugary, which is a good thing for me. Store hours are short. Staff is polite but don't not friendly enough to spend much time with you explaining about the products."
265,"Wow, an array of cheeses and it was packed on a Saturday afternoon! I snuck into the bread line and got two cheese breads, a wolverine, and an olive focaccia bread. Only had the cheese breads, and my friend loved the burnt cheese all over it. It was a little too burnt and crunch for me, but it was really delicious! Fresh and warm out of the oven! Prices are really fair as well."
266,"Before there was Cheese Board Pizza there was the Cheese Board Collective.  They've been in Berkeley since 1967 and were, along w/ Peet's, the beginnings of the Gourmet Ghetto.  They became a worker owned co-op in 1971.  They were one of the first cheese shops I encountered as a young woman and they were probably the first bakery in Berkeley to make a proper baguette w/ the authentic texture.  In the beginning they were a cool little shop and over the decades they have grown into a powerhouse.  They still sell a wide variety of cheeses, but they also sell a rotating range of baked goods, most savory and some sweet and their iconic pizza.  The pizza is sold half baked to take home or ready to eat slices to eat there, or on the median strip, despite the signs.  We check their pizza offerings, which change daily, online and buy half a pizza to bake for dinner when it sounds good.  I have a separate review for Cheese Board Pizza, which has become our preferred pizza source because of their imaginative combinations.  The Cheese Board also has live music, one group at lunch, another at dinner, which is very cool"
267,"Even with the storm, this doesn't seem to deter the huge crowds on a Saturday morning wanting their gluten fix. Came here with the intent of buying some cheese, but ended up with a bag of baked goods, pizza, and their green sauce.  I'm obsessed with their green sauce, and will slather it on everything possible! So excited that the cheese shop carries them here for $4/container. They have tons of local and international cheeses, with samples available. They also carry Cowgirl Creamery! My favs: cheese rolls, provolone olive roll, and all their Cowgirl Creamery cheeses PRO TIP: They sell their half baked pizzas at the bakery as well, if you want to avoid the lines at their restaurant next door. However, there's lines here too, but they move quick!"
268,"It was my very first time here yesterday and I was shocked at how many people were waiting in line for this pizza. I thought to myself, wow is it really that good? Lol well it definitely was tasty! I've never had a pizza like this! The flavor was so tangy and delicious definitely worth the 25 min wait!"
269,"- Had a special ""Pride Celebration"" pizza... Heirloom tomato, red onion, mozzarella and aged Asiago cheese, garlic olive oil, parsley, oregano. Highly recommend it.- A little on the cheesy side for my own liking...but thats to be expected given the name, and the cheese was amazing. - Very reasonably priced...2/3 people can split a large pizza and it comes to $22 total. - Also has exclusively vegetarian options...which is a win in my book :) - Overall one of the best pizzas I've had in the Bay."
270,"Been around for years so they don't need validation from me - but the place is clean,consistent and the food is amazing! The food, specifically, being that daily chef chosen pizza!"
271,"My cousin brought me a tub of ricotta last night.It's now 8:44am the following day..and it's almost gone.Ricotta, bread, breakfast.This is the ricotta in the metal tin that they put in a plastic tub for you. Not too sure of the producer.But, I'm in cheese heaven."
272,This place is a national treasure as I have not been there for a while and only downside is closed Sunday. It only gets better with age  and the brioche is better than ever and the cheese bread is cheesier. Best of its type in USA.
273,"People say it's much better than Sliver but I can't really say. The pizza is great, and I think the cilantro sauce is less salty. I love how thin the crust is. Good for vegetarians.The band performing was absolutely beautiful."
274,"This place is amazing. Great variety of cheeses and all sorts of delights to pair them with from fresh baked breads to delicious jams and whole honeycombs. Parking is a bit of a free for all and you'll likely have to pay to park in a lot unless you can find street parking off to the side somewhere.At the cheese counter, pick up a playing card and when your card is called you get one on one treatment from a cheese expert. They have you try each cheese before buying as the taste can vary from batch to batch and even among wheels. I'm a big cheese fan so it was hard not to love everything I tried but I particularly enjoyed both the Swiss and French raclette and a very creamy brie that I can't recall the name of but Vicky can tell you as it is one of her favorites which she suggested to me.Aside from the cheese, we always pick up a whole honeycomb and a seeded baguette. Also popular are their cheese rolls which are a tasty sourdough with delicious cheese globs baked into it. I do prefer the cheese rolls at Acme though, where the cheese is blended in the dough and every bite is elasticy cheesy bready goodness."
275,"Excellent pastries and cheeses. Can recommend the cheese bread, carrot muffin and the cornbread sconces. Delicious!"
276,"Like I said in my last review, I did come back to try more muffins and a few ""chocolate things""! It was around 7:30 AM on a Friday and the place was already busy, but not enough to have a line :)**After the success of the apple apricot muffin last time, I picked a carrot spice muffin which was full of raisins, golden raisins, nuts, and of course carrots. Would recommend! **The chocolate things were also amazing, they're full of huge chocolate chunks rather than maybe a swirl, and the bread itself is soft and chewy. Make sure to eat the chocolate things while they're warm (i.e. Heat them up the next day) because otherwise they get kind of hard. **Also picked up a few scones -- 1 berry/lemon and 1 berry/corn (yum!! Texture is a mix between cornbread and scone) --  which were good but TL;DR if you can only pick a few things I'd definitely go for a muffin or chocolate thing."
277,Tasty healthy vegan pizza! It's harf to believe it isnt real cheese! Definetly stop by for fresh and hot pizza if youre In the area =) they also serve organic soft serve. yummm!
278,Can't go wrong with a pizza from here and their green sauce. Line can seem intimidating but it moves fast! The pro of serving only one flavor a day. Seating can be a game of chance but I haven't had any issues the times I've been.
279,Have only been here once and never knew about this amazing place. I love simple concepts like this. One flavor of pizza each day. Stand in line. Get your slice. And eat. My boyfriend and I tried this place out because he loves pizza. I cannot recall what the pizza flavor was for the day but it was simple and didn't have any fancy cheeses or veggies on there. We grabbed about four slices and two glasses of wine. Sat at a table near the open windows. Listened the a live band play during dinner. And ended up sharing our table with a few strangers during the night.It was very casual. And comfortable. The food was great and the ambiance was chill. And it was cheap overall. They have a website if you don't want to be spontaneous. It displays their pizza flavor for the day. So if you want to know before you make the drive out there. It's convenient. Good luck! And don't forget to purchase the baked garlic. Yum!
280,"If you're here with family, friends, with two, solo, just buy the whole dang pizza because you'll regret not having the chance to scarf it down. Sure, you might have leftovers- take it home and freeze if it makes it until the next day. Or you can stand in line again for another half; the line is terribly long down the street, but the place is so efficient it will only take minutes. This pizza is good because of the dough. The dough is good because it is, in essence, bread. Good bread. Bread that can be eaten without the fripperies of tomato sauce, cheese, and whatever one topping they decide to do for the day. But they add this stuff to the good bread and it becomes a lovely pizza."
281,"When I told my LA friends I was heading up to Berkeley, two said this was the ""best"" place and that I ""must go."" They raved about the eggplant topping. Wait time & seating: Came around 2pm on a Saturday and the line took us about 20-30minutes. There is an incredibly limited amount of seating for the amount of people who come by, so get to praying before you arrive. We lucked out with seats by the live band, which was neat but made it difficult to talk without yelling. Pizza comes out incredibly fast, because they only serve one type per day. Food: I'm personally a fan of thicker, chewier crusts, so this was disappointing and didn't amount to the hype it received. It was average pizza with average, unmemorable toppings (the day I went). It's probably better other days, but not a fan of the ""take your chance"" game if I'm craving pizza one day. Price: For $24 (after tax), the pizza certainly wasn't worth it. More of a hype place, based on that day's pizza."
282,"I've heard about the Cheese Board from multiple friends for a long time but have not tried it until last week. We arrived around 11am and there were already a lot of people there because the bakery/cheese side is open by 8am. Even though the pizza side doesn't open until 11:30, there were already a lot of people waiting around for it. I recommend getting there early if you want to avoid a wait. People start to form an official line as soon as they open at 11:30.I didn't try and of the cheese but the bakery side had lots of good bread and baked goods options. We ended up buying the Sunday Bread, scone, chocolate things, and the Ginger Molasses cookie. All of them were really good! The Sunday bread and chocolate things can be a bit dense and dry if you eat it the next day but I found microwaving them to be a good way to enjoy them :) I found out that the Cheese Board only makes one flavor a day. The pizza of the day was with roasted potatoes (carbs on carbs), caramelized onions, mozzarella, and cave aged gruyere, cheese, garlic olive oil, parsley, and oregano. Even though they only make one flavor a day they do have vegan options. The pizzas were very reasonably priced, at $3 slice. When I got the pizza it was  burning hot, which is not necessarily a bad thing but I found it hard to even leave it on my lap when I was trying to eat it in their outdoor seating area. Even though I'm not usually a pizza fan, I enjoyed the pizza here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the area again.Pros:- Bakery and Cheese shop open early, can shop there while waiting for the pizza- Half baked pizza available at the bakery- Fresh pizza - Vegetarian and Vegan optionsCons:- Only one flavor so if you don't like it then there's not much of an alternative- Long lines and really crowded - Staffs are not the friendliest people, don't really bother to greet you or even smile- Pizza on the oily size so make sure to grab napkins!"
283,"If you a cheese lover, you have to come here. They have so many cheeses I didn't even know existed.They also have a large variety of breads, though not as extravagant as their cheese selection. I got 6 English muffins for $5.50. I'm not a big fan of English muffins, but they were the best English muffins I've ever had.

There is an incredibly limited amount of seating for the amount of people who come by, so get to praying before you arrive.

322,"I've heard about the Cheese Board from multiple friends for a long time but have not tried it until last week. We arrived around 11am and there were already a lot of people there because the bakery/cheese side is open by 8am. Even though the pizza side doesn't open until 11:30, there were already a lot of people waiting around for it. I recommend getting there early if you want to avoid a wait. People start to form an official line as soon as they open at 11:30.I didn't try and of the cheese but the bakery side had lots of good bread and baked goods options. We ended up buying the Sunday Bread, scone, chocolate things, and the Ginger Molasses cookie. All of them were really good! The Sunday bread and chocolate things can be a bit dense and dry if you eat it the next day but I found microwaving them to be a good way to enjoy them :) I found out that the Cheese Board only makes one flavor a day. The pizza of the day was with roasted potatoes (carbs on carbs), caramelized onions, mozzarella, and cave aged gruyere, cheese, garlic olive oil, parsley, and oregano. Even though they only make one flavor a day they do have vegan options. The pizzas were very reasonably priced, at $3 slice. When I got the pizza it was  burning hot, which is not necessarily a bad thing but I found it hard to even leave it on my lap when I was trying to eat it in their outdoor seating area. Even though I'm not usually a pizza fan, I enjoyed the pizza here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the area again.Pros:- Bakery and Cheese shop open early, can shop there while waiting for the pizza- Half baked pizza available at the bakery- Fresh pizza - Vegetarian and Vegan optionsCons:- Only one flavor so if you don't like it then there's not much of an alternative- Long lines and really crowded - Staffs are not the friendliest people, don't really bother to greet you or even smile- Pizza on the oily size so make sure to grab napkins!"
323,"If you a cheese lover, you have to come here. They have so many cheeses I didn't even know existed.They also have a large variety of breads, though not as extravagant as their cheese selection. I got 6 English muffins for $5.50. I'm not a big fan of English muffins, but they were the best English muffins I've ever had. I ate one right when I got them, and put the rest in the fridge hoping they would still be fluffy. When I took them out of the fridge, they were rock hard, but I popped them in the fridge. Like magic, they were back to the soft soft fluffy English muffins they were the day before. So far, I haven't tried anything else, but am definitely going to go back and try their other breads and cheeses.**note: If you are looking for pizza, it's next door. I accidentally came in here because I was in a hurry and saw the word cheese and thought this was Cheese Board Pizza. (silly me)TL;DR Cheese heaven"
324,"Good selection of cheese, bread and other sweet and savory snacks.  Coffee is decent. The sweet goodies aren't that sugary, which is a good thing for me. Store hours are short. Staff is polite but don't not friendly enough to spend much time with you explaining about the products."
325,"Wow, an array of cheeses and it was packed on a Saturday afternoon! I snuck into the bread line and got two cheese breads, a wolverine, and an olive focaccia bread. Only had the cheese breads, and my friend loved the burnt cheese all over it. It was a little too burnt and crunch for me, but it was really delicious! Fresh and warm out of the oven! Prices are really fair as well."
326,"Before there was Cheese Board Pizza there was the Cheese Board Collective.  They've been in Berkeley since 1967 and were, along w/ Peet's, the beginnings of the Gourmet Ghetto.  They became a worker owned co-op in 1971.  They were one of the first cheese shops I encountered as a young woman and they were probably the first bakery in Berkeley to make a proper baguette w/ the authentic texture.  In the beginning they were a cool little shop and over the decades they have grown into a powerhouse.  They still sell a wide variety of cheeses, but they also sell a rotating range of baked goods, most savory and some sweet and their iconic pizza.  The pizza is sold half baked to take home or ready to eat slices to eat there, or on the median strip, despite the signs.  We check their pizza offerings, which change daily, online and buy half a pizza to bake for dinner when it sounds good.  I have a separate review for Cheese Board Pizza, which has become our preferred pizza source because of their imaginative combinations.  The Cheese Board also has live music, one group at lunch, another at dinner, which is very cool"
327,"Even with the storm, this doesn't seem to deter the huge crowds on a Saturday morning wanting their gluten fix. Came here with the intent of buying some cheese, but ended up with a bag of baked goods, pizza, and their green sauce.  I'm obsessed with their green sauce, and will slather it on everything possible! So excited that the cheese shop carries them here for $4/container. They have tons of local and international cheeses, with samples available. They also carry Cowgirl Creamery! My favs: cheese rolls, provolone olive roll, and all their Cowgirl Creamery cheeses PRO TIP: They sell their half baked pizzas at the bakery as well, if you want to avoid the lines at their restaurant next door.

329,"- Had a special ""Pride Celebration"" pizza... Heirloom tomato, red onion, mozzarella and aged Asiago cheese, garlic olive oil, parsley, oregano. Highly recommend it.- A little on the cheesy side for my own liking...but thats to be expected given the name, and the cheese was amazing. - Very reasonably priced...2/3 people can split a large pizza and it comes to $22 total. - Also has exclusively vegetarian options...which is a win in my book :) - Overall one of the best pizzas I've had in the Bay."
330,"Been around for years so they don't need validation from me - but the place is clean,consistent and the food is amazing! The food, specifically, being that daily chef chosen pizza!"
331,"My cousin brought me a tub of ricotta last night.It's now 8:44am the following day..and it's almost gone.Ricotta, bread, breakfast.This is the ricotta in the metal tin that they put in a plastic tub for you. Not too sure of the producer.But, I'm in cheese heaven."
332,This place is a national treasure as I have not been there for a while and only downside is closed Sunday. It only gets better with age  and the brioche is better than ever and the cheese bread is cheesier. Best of its type in USA.
333,"People say it's much better than Sliver but I can't really say. The pizza is great, and I think the cilantro sauce is less salty. I love how thin the crust is. Good for vegetarians.The band performing was absolutely beautiful."
334,"This place is amazing. Great variety of cheeses and all sorts of delights to pair them with from fresh baked breads to delicious jams and whole honeycombs. Parking is a bit of a free for all and you'll likely have to pay to park in a lot unless you can find street parking off to the side somewhere.At the cheese counter, pick up a playing card and when your card is called you get one on one treatment from a cheese expert. They have you try each cheese before buying as the taste can vary from batch to batch and even among wheels. I'm a big cheese fan so it was hard not to love everything I tried but I particularly enjoyed both the Swiss and French raclette and a very creamy brie that I can't recall the name of but Vicky can tell you as it is one of her favorites which she suggested to me.Aside from the cheese, we always pick up a whole honeycomb and a seeded baguette. Also popular are their cheese rolls which are a tasty sourdough with delicious cheese globs baked into it. I do prefer the cheese rolls at Acme though, where the cheese is blended in the dough and every bite is elasticy cheesy bready goodness."
335,"Excellent pastries and cheeses. Can recommend the cheese bread, carrot muffin and the cornbread sconces. Delicious!"
336,"Like I said in my last review, I did come back to try more muffins and a few ""chocolate things""! It was around 7:30 AM on a Friday and the place was already busy, but not enough to have a line :)**After the success of the apple apricot muffin last time, I picked a carrot spice muffin which was full of raisins, golden raisins, nuts, and of course carrots. Would recommend! **The chocolate things were also amazing, they're full of huge chocolate chunks rather than maybe a swirl, and the bread itself is soft and chewy. Make sure to eat the chocolate things while they're warm (i.e. Heat them up the next day) because otherwise they get kind of hard. **Also picked up a few scones -- 1 berry/lemon and 1 berry/corn (yum!! Texture is a mix between cornbread and scone) --  which were good but TL;DR if you can only pick a few things I'd definitely go for a muffin or chocolate thing."
337,Tasty healthy vegan pizza! It's harf to believe it isnt real cheese! Definetly stop by for fresh and hot pizza if youre In the area =) they also serve organic soft serve. yummm!
338,Can't go wrong with a pizza from here and their green sauce. Line can seem intimidating but it moves fast! The pro of serving only one flavor a day. Seating can be a game of chance but I haven't had any issues the times I've been.
339,Have only been here once and never knew about this amazing place. I love simple concepts like this. One flavor of pizza each day. Stand in line. Get your slice. And eat. My boyfriend and I tried this place out because he loves pizza. I cannot recall what the pizza flavor was for the day but it was simple and didn't have any fancy cheeses or veggies on there. We grabbed about four slices and two glasses of wine. Sat at a table near the open windows. Listened the a live band play during dinner. And ended up sharing our table with a few strangers during the night.It was very casual. And comfortable. The food was great and the ambiance was chill. And it was cheap overall. They have a website if you don't want to be spontaneous. It displays their pizza flavor for the day. So if you want to know before you make the drive out there. It's convenient. Good luck! And don't forget to purchase the baked garlic. Yum!

372,This place is a national treasure as I have not been there for a while and only downside is closed Sunday. It only gets better with age  and the brioche is better than ever and the cheese bread is cheesier. Best of its type in USA.
373,"People say it's much better than Sliver but I can't really say. The pizza is great, and I think the cilantro sauce is less salty. I love how thin the crust is. Good for vegetarians.The band performing was absolutely beautiful."
374,"This place is amazing. Great variety of cheeses and all sorts of delights to pair them with from fresh baked breads to delicious jams and whole honeycombs.

Also popular are their cheese rolls which are a tasty sourdough with delicious cheese globs baked into it. I do prefer the cheese rolls at Acme though, where the cheese is blended in the dough and every bite is elasticy cheesy bready goodness."

376,"Like I said in my last review, I did come back to try more muffins and a few ""chocolate things""! It was around 7:30 AM on a Friday and the place was already busy, but not enough to have a line :)**After the success of the apple apricot muffin last time, I picked a carrot spice muffin which was full of raisins, golden raisins, nuts, and of course carrots. Would recommend! **The chocolate things were also amazing, they're full of huge chocolate chunks rather than maybe a swirl, and the bread itself is soft and chewy. Make sure to eat the chocolate things while they're warm (i.e. Heat them up the next day) because otherwise they get kind of hard. **Also picked up a few scones -- 1 berry/lemon and 1 berry/corn (yum!! Texture is a mix between cornbread and scone) --  which were good but TL;DR if you can only pick a few things I'd definitely go for a muffin or chocolate thing."
377,Tasty healthy vegan pizza! It's harf to believe it isnt real cheese! Definetly stop by for fresh and hot pizza if youre In the area =) they also serve organic soft serve. yummm!
378,Can't go wrong with a pizza from here and their green sauce. Line can seem intimidating but it moves fast! The pro of serving only one flavor a day. Seating can be a game of chance but I haven't had any issues the times I've been.
379,Have only been here once and never knew about this amazing place. I love simple concepts like this. One flavor of pizza each day. Stand in line. Get your slice. And eat. My boyfriend and I tried this place out because he loves pizza. I cannot recall what the pizza flavor was for the day but it was simple and didn't have any fancy cheeses or veggies on there. We grabbed about four slices and two glasses of wine. Sat at a table near the open windows. Listened the a live band play during dinner. And ended up sharing our table with a few strangers during the night.It was very casual. And comfortable. The food was great and the ambiance was chill. And it was cheap overall. They have a website if you don't want to be spontaneous. It displays their pizza flavor for the day. So if you want to know before you make the drive out there. It's convenient. Good luck! And don't forget to purchase the baked garlic. Yum!
380,"If you're here with family, friends, with two, solo, just buy the whole dang pizza because you'll regret not having the chance to scarf it down. Sure, you might have leftovers- take it home and freeze if it makes it until the next day. Or you can stand in line again for another half; the line is terribly long down the street, but the place is so efficient it will only take minutes. This pizza is good because of the dough. The dough is good because it is, in essence, bread. Good bread. Bread that can be eaten without the fripperies of tomato sauce, cheese, and whatever one topping they decide to do for the day. But they add this stuff to the good bread and it becomes a lovely pizza."
381,"When I told my LA friends I was heading up to Berkeley, two said this was the ""best"" place and that I ""must go."" They raved about the eggplant topping. Wait time & seating: Came around 2pm on a Saturday and the line took us about 20-30minutes. There is an incredibly limited amount of seating for the amount of people who come by, so get to praying before you arrive. We lucked out with seats by the live band, which was neat but made it difficult to talk without yelling. Pizza comes out incredibly fast, because they only serve one type per day. Food: I'm personally a fan of thicker, chewier crusts, so this was disappointing and didn't amount to the hype it received. It was average pizza with average, unmemorable toppings (the day I went). It's probably better other days, but not a fan of the ""take your chance"" game if I'm craving pizza one day. Price: For $24 (after tax), the pizza certainly wasn't worth it. More of a hype place, based on that day's pizza."
382,"I've heard about the Cheese Board from multiple friends for a long time but have not tried it until last week. We arrived around 11am and there were already a lot of people there because the bakery/cheese side is open by 8am. Even though the pizza side doesn't open until 11:30, there were already a lot of people waiting around for it. I recommend getting there early if you want to avoid a wait. People start to form an official line as soon as they open at 11:30.I didn't try and of the cheese but the bakery side had lots of good bread and baked goods options. We ended up buying the Sunday Bread, scone, chocolate things, and the Ginger Molasses cookie. All of them were really good! The Sunday bread and chocolate things can be a bit dense and dry if you eat it the next day but I found microwaving them to be a good way to enjoy them :) I found out that the Cheese Board only makes one flavor a day. The pizza of the day was with roasted potatoes (carbs on carbs), caramelized onions, mozzarella, and cave aged gruyere, cheese, garlic olive oil, parsley, and oregano. Even though they only make one flavor a day they do have vegan options. The pizzas were very reasonably priced, at $3 slice. When I got the pizza it was  burning hot, which is not necessarily a bad thing but I found it hard to even leave it on my lap when I was trying to eat it in their outdoor seating area. Even though I'm not usually a pizza fan, I enjoyed the pizza here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the area again.Pros:- Bakery and Cheese shop open early, can shop there while waiting for the pizza- Half baked pizza available at the bakery- Fresh pizza - Vegetarian and Vegan optionsCons:- Only one flavor so if you don't like it then there's not much of an alternative- Long lines and really crowded - Staffs are not the friendliest people, don't really bother to greet you or even smile- Pizza on the oily size so make sure to grab napkins!"
383,"If you a cheese lover, you have to come here. They have so many cheeses I didn't even know existed.They also have a large variety of breads, though not as extravagant as their cheese selection. I got 6 English muffins for $5.50. I'm not a big fan of English muffins, but they were the best English muffins I've ever had. I ate one right when I got them, and put the rest in the fridge hoping they would still be fluffy. When I took them out of the fridge, they were rock hard, but I popped them in the fridge. Like magic, they were back to the soft soft fluffy English muffins they were the day before. So far, I haven't tried anything else, but am definitely going to go back and try their other breads and cheeses.**note: If you are looking for pizza, it's next door. I accidentally came in here because I was in a hurry and saw the word cheese and thought this was Cheese Board Pizza. (silly me)TL;DR Cheese heaven"
384,"Good selection of cheese, bread and other sweet and savory snacks.  Coffee is decent. The sweet goodies aren't that sugary, which is a good thing for me. Store hours are short. Staff is polite but don't not friendly enough to spend much time with you explaining about the products."
385,"Wow, an array of cheeses and it was packed on a Saturday afternoon! I snuck into the bread line and got two cheese breads, a wolverine, and an olive focaccia bread. Only had the cheese breads, and my friend loved the burnt cheese all over it. It was a little too burnt and crunch for me, but it was really delicious! Fresh and warm out of the oven! Prices are really fair as well."
386,"Before there was Cheese Board Pizza there was the Cheese Board Collective.  They've been in Berkeley since 1967 and were, along w/ Peet's, the beginnings of the Gourmet Ghetto.  They became a worker owned co-op in 1971.  They were one of the first cheese shops I encountered as a young woman and they were probably the first bakery in Berkeley to make a proper baguette w/ the authentic texture.  In the beginning they were a cool little shop and over the decades they have grown into a powerhouse.  They still sell a wide variety of cheeses, but they also sell a rotating range of baked goods, most savory and some sweet and their iconic pizza.  The pizza is sold half baked to take home or ready to eat slices to eat there, or on the median strip, despite the signs.  We check their pizza offerings, which change daily, online and buy half a pizza to bake for dinner when it sounds good.  I have a separate review for Cheese Board Pizza, which has become our preferred pizza source because of their imaginative combinations.  The Cheese Board also has live music, one group at lunch, another at dinner, which is very cool"
387,"Even with the storm, this doesn't seem to deter the huge crowds on a Saturday morning wanting their gluten fix. Came here with the intent of buying some cheese, but ended up with a bag of baked goods, pizza, and their green sauce.  I'm obsessed with their green sauce, and will slather it on everything possible! So excited that the cheese shop carries them here for $4/container. They have tons of local and international cheeses, with samples available. They also carry Cowgirl Creamery! My favs: cheese rolls, provolone olive roll, and all their Cowgirl Creamery cheeses PRO TIP: They sell their half baked pizzas at the bakery as well, if you want to avoid the lines at their restaurant next door. However, there's lines here too, but they move quick!"
388,"It was my very first time here yesterday and I was shocked at how many people were waiting in line for this pizza. I thought to myself, wow is it really that good? Lol well it definitely was tasty! I've never had a pizza like this! The flavor was so tangy and delicious definitely worth the 25 min wait!"
389,"- Had a special ""Pride Celebration"" pizza... Heirloom tomato, red onion, mozzarella and aged Asiago cheese, garlic olive oil, parsley, oregano.

So far, I haven't tried anything else, but am definitely going to go back and try their other breads and cheeses.**note: If you are looking for pizza, it's next door. I accidentally came in here because I was in a hurry and saw the word cheese and thought this was Cheese Board Pizza. (silly me)TL;DR Cheese heaven"
424,"Good selection of cheese, bread and other sweet and savory snacks.  Coffee is decent. The sweet goodies aren't that sugary, which is a good thing for me. Store hours are short. Staff is polite but don't not friendly enough to spend much time with you explaining about the products."
425,"Wow, an array of cheeses and it was packed on a Saturday afternoon! I snuck into the bread line and got two cheese breads, a wolverine, and an olive focaccia bread. Only had the cheese breads, and my friend loved the burnt cheese all over it. It was a little too burnt and crunch for me, but it was really delicious! Fresh and warm out of the oven! Prices are really fair as well."
426,"Before there was Cheese Board Pizza there was the Cheese Board Collective.  They've been in Berkeley since 1967 and were, along w/ Peet's, the beginnings of the Gourmet Ghetto.  They became a worker owned co-op in 1971.  They were one of the first cheese shops I encountered as a young woman and they were probably the first bakery in Berkeley to make a proper baguette w/ the authentic texture.  In the beginning they were a cool little shop and over the decades they have grown into a powerhouse.  They still sell a wide variety of cheeses, but they also sell a rotating range of baked goods, most savory and some sweet and their iconic pizza.  The pizza is sold half baked to take home or ready to eat slices to eat there, or on the median strip, despite the signs.  We check their pizza offerings, which change daily, online and buy half a pizza to bake for dinner when it sounds good.  I have a separate review for Cheese Board Pizza, which has become our preferred pizza source because of their imaginative combinations.  The Cheese Board also has live music, one group at lunch, another at dinner, which is very cool"
427,"Even with the storm, this doesn't seem to deter the huge crowds on a Saturday morning wanting their gluten fix. Came here with the intent of buying some cheese, but ended up with a bag of baked goods, pizza, and their green sauce.  I'm obsessed with their green sauce, and will slather it on everything possible! So excited that the cheese shop carries them here for $4/container. They have tons of local and international cheeses, with samples available. They also carry Cowgirl Creamery! My favs: cheese rolls, provolone olive roll, and all their Cowgirl Creamery cheeses PRO TIP: They sell their half baked pizzas at the bakery as well, if you want to avoid the lines at their restaurant next door. However, there's lines here too, but they move quick!"
428,"It was my very first time here yesterday and I was shocked at how many people were waiting in line for this pizza. I thought to myself, wow is it really that good? Lol well it definitely was tasty! I've never had a pizza like this! The flavor was so tangy and delicious definitely worth the 25 min wait!"
429,"- Had a special ""Pride Celebration"" pizza... Heirloom tomato, red onion, mozzarella and aged Asiago cheese, garlic olive oil, parsley, oregano. Highly recommend it.- A little on the cheesy side for my own liking...but thats to be expected given the name, and the cheese was amazing. - Very reasonably priced...2/3 people can split a large pizza and it comes to $22 total. - Also has exclusively vegetarian options...which is a win in my book :) - Overall one of the best pizzas I've had in the Bay."
430,"Been around for years so they don't need validation from me - but the place is clean,consistent and the food is amazing! The food, specifically, being that daily chef chosen pizza!"
431,"My cousin brought me a tub of ricotta last night.It's now 8:44am the following day..and it's almost gone.Ricotta, bread, breakfast.This is the ricotta in the metal tin that they put in a plastic tub for you. Not too sure of the producer.But, I'm in cheese heaven."
432,This place is a national treasure as I have not been there for a while and only downside is closed Sunday. It only gets better with age  and the brioche is better than ever and the cheese bread is cheesier. Best of its type in USA.
433,"People say it's much better than Sliver but I can't really say. The pizza is great, and I think the cilantro sauce is less salty. I love how thin the crust is. Good for vegetarians.The band performing was absolutely beautiful."
434,"This place is amazing. Great variety of cheeses and all sorts of delights to pair them with from fresh baked breads to delicious jams and whole honeycombs. Parking is a bit of a free for all and you'll likely have to pay to park in a lot unless you can find street parking off to the side somewhere.At the cheese counter, pick up a playing card and when your card is called you get one on one treatment from a cheese expert. They have you try each cheese before buying as the taste can vary from batch to batch and even among wheels. I'm a big cheese fan so it was hard not to love everything I tried but I particularly enjoyed both the Swiss and French raclette and a very creamy brie that I can't recall the name of but Vicky can tell you as it is one of her favorites which she suggested to me.Aside from the cheese, we always pick up a whole honeycomb and a seeded baguette. Also popular are their cheese rolls which are a tasty sourdough with delicious cheese globs baked into it. I do prefer the cheese rolls at Acme though, where the cheese is blended in the dough and every bite is elasticy cheesy bready goodness."
435,"Excellent pastries and cheeses. Can recommend the cheese bread, carrot muffin and the cornbread sconces. Delicious!"
436,"Like I said in my last review, I did come back to try more muffins and a few ""chocolate things""! It was around 7:30 AM on a Friday and the place was already busy, but not enough to have a line :)**After the success of the apple apricot muffin last time, I picked a carrot spice muffin which was full of raisins, golden raisins, nuts, and of course carrots. Would recommend! **The chocolate things were also amazing, they're full of huge chocolate chunks rather than maybe a swirl, and the bread itself is soft and chewy. Make sure to eat the chocolate things while they're warm (i.e. Heat them up the next day) because otherwise they get kind of hard. **Also picked up a few scones -- 1 berry/lemon and 1 berry/corn (yum!! Texture is a mix between cornbread and scone) --  which were good but TL;DR if you can only pick a few things I'd definitely go for a muffin or chocolate thing."
437,Tasty healthy vegan pizza! It's harf to believe it isnt real cheese! Definetly stop by for fresh and hot pizza if youre In the area =) they also serve organic soft serve. yummm!
438,Can't go wrong with a pizza from here and their green sauce. Line can seem intimidating but it moves fast! The pro of serving only one flavor a day. Seating can be a game of chance but I haven't had any issues the times I've been.
439,Have only been here once and never knew about this amazing place. I love simple concepts like this. One flavor of pizza each day. Stand in line. Get your slice. And eat. My boyfriend and I tried this place out because he loves pizza. I cannot recall what the pizza flavor was for the day but it was simple and didn't have any fancy cheeses or veggies on there. We grabbed about four slices and two glasses of wine. Sat at a table near the open windows. Listened the a live band play during dinner. And ended up sharing our table with a few strangers during the night.It was very casual. And comfortable. The food was great and the ambiance was chill. And it was cheap overall. They have a website if you don't want to be spontaneous. It displays their pizza flavor for the day. So if you want to know before you make the drive out there. It's convenient. Good luck! And don't forget to purchase the baked garlic. Yum!
440,"If you're here with family, friends, with two, solo, just buy the whole dang pizza because you'll regret not having the chance to scarf it down. Sure, you might have leftovers- take it home and freeze if it makes it until the next day. Or you can stand in line again for another half; the line is terribly long down the street, but the place is so efficient it will only take minutes. This pizza is good because of the dough. The dough is good because it is, in essence, bread. Good bread. Bread that can be eaten without the fripperies of tomato sauce, cheese, and whatever one topping they decide to do for the day. But they add this stuff to the good bread and it becomes a lovely pizza."
441,"When I told my LA friends I was heading up to Berkeley, two said this was the ""best"" place and that I ""must go."" They raved about the eggplant topping. Wait time & seating: Came around 2pm on a Saturday and the line took us about 20-30minutes. There is an incredibly limited amount of seating for the amount of people who come by, so get to praying before you arrive. We lucked out with seats by the live band, which was neat but made it difficult to talk without yelling. Pizza comes out incredibly fast, because they only serve one type per day. Food: I'm personally a fan of thicker, chewier crusts, so this was disappointing and didn't amount to the hype it received. It was average pizza with average, unmemorable toppings (the day I went). It's probably better other days, but not a fan of the ""take your chance"" game if I'm craving pizza one day. Price: For $24 (after tax), the pizza certainly wasn't worth it. More of a hype place, based on that day's pizza."
442,"I've heard about the Cheese Board from multiple friends for a long time but have not tried it until last week. We arrived around 11am and there were already a lot of people there because the bakery/cheese side is open by 8am. Even though the pizza side doesn't open until 11:30, there were already a lot of people waiting around for it. I recommend getting there early if you want to avoid a wait. People start to form an official line as soon as they open at 11:30.I didn't try and of the cheese but the bakery side had lots of good bread and baked goods options. We ended up buying the Sunday Bread, scone, chocolate things, and the Ginger Molasses cookie. All of them were really good! The Sunday bread and chocolate things can be a bit dense and dry if you eat it the next day but I found microwaving them to be a good way to enjoy them :) I found out that the Cheese Board only makes one flavor a day. The pizza of the day was with roasted potatoes (carbs on carbs), caramelized onions, mozzarella, and cave aged gruyere, cheese, garlic olive oil, parsley, and oregano. Even though they only make one flavor a day they do have vegan options. The pizzas were very reasonably priced, at $3 slice. When I got the pizza it was  burning hot, which is not necessarily a bad thing but I found it hard to even leave it on my lap when I was trying to eat it in their outdoor seating area. Even though I'm not usually a pizza fan, I enjoyed the pizza here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the area again.Pros:- Bakery and Cheese shop open early, can shop there while waiting for the pizza- Half baked pizza available at the bakery- Fresh pizza - Vegetarian and Vegan optionsCons:- Only one flavor so if you don't like it then there's not much of an alternative- Long lines and really crowded - Staffs are not the friendliest people, don't really bother to greet you or even smile- Pizza on the oily size so make sure to grab napkins!"

480,"If you're here with family, friends, with two, solo, just buy the whole dang pizza because you'll regret not having the chance to scarf it down. Sure, you might have leftovers- take it home and freeze if it makes it until the next day. Or you can stand in line again for another half; the line is terribly long down the street, but the place is so efficient it will only take minutes. This pizza is good because of the dough. The dough is good because it is, in essence, bread. Good bread. Bread that can be eaten without the fripperies of tomato sauce, cheese, and whatever one topping they decide to do for the day. But they add this stuff to the good bread and it becomes a lovely pizza."
481,"When I told my LA friends I was heading up to Berkeley, two said this was the ""best"" place and that I ""must go."" They raved about the eggplant topping. Wait time & seating: Came around 2pm on a Saturday and the line took us about 20-30minutes. There is an incredibly limited amount of seating for the amount of people who come by, so get to praying before you arrive. We lucked out with seats by the live band, which was neat but made it difficult to talk without yelling. Pizza comes out incredibly fast, because they only serve one type per day. Food: I'm personally a fan of thicker, chewier crusts, so this was disappointing and didn't amount to the hype it received. It was average pizza with average, unmemorable toppings (the day I went). It's probably better other days, but not a fan of the ""take your chance"" game if I'm craving pizza one day. Price: For $24 (after tax), the pizza certainly wasn't worth it.

482,"I've heard about the Cheese Board from multiple friends for a long time but have not tried it until last week. We arrived around 11am and there were already a lot of people there because the bakery/cheese side is open by 8am. Even though the pizza side doesn't open until 11:30, there were already a lot of people waiting around for it. I recommend getting there early if you want to avoid a wait. People start to form an official line as soon as they open at 11:30.I didn't try and of the cheese but the bakery side had lots of good bread and baked goods options. We ended up buying the Sunday Bread, scone, chocolate things, and the Ginger Molasses cookie. All of them were really good! The Sunday bread and chocolate things can be a bit dense and dry if you eat it the next day but I found microwaving them to be a good way to enjoy them :) I found out that the Cheese Board only makes one flavor a day. The pizza of the day was with roasted potatoes (carbs on carbs), caramelized onions, mozzarella, and cave aged gruyere, cheese, garlic olive oil, parsley, and oregano. Even though they only make one flavor a day they do have vegan options. The pizzas were very reasonably priced, at $3 slice. When I got the pizza it was  burning hot, which is not necessarily a bad thing but I found it hard to even leave it on my lap when I was trying to eat it in their outdoor seating area. Even though I'm not usually a pizza fan, I enjoyed the pizza here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the area again.Pros:- Bakery and Cheese shop open early, can shop there while waiting for the pizza- Half baked pizza available at the bakery- Fresh pizza - Vegetarian and Vegan optionsCons:- Only one flavor so if you don't like it then there's not much of an alternative- Long lines and really crowded - Staffs are not the friendliest people, don't really bother to greet you or even smile- Pizza on the oily size so make sure to grab napkins!"
483,"If you a cheese lover, you have to come here. They have so many cheeses I didn't even know existed.They also have a large variety of breads, though not as extravagant as their cheese selection. I got 6 English muffins for $5.50. I'm not a big fan of English muffins, but they were the best English muffins I've ever had. I ate one right when I got them, and put the rest in the fridge hoping they would still be fluffy. When I took them out of the fridge, they were rock hard, but I popped them in the fridge. Like magic, they were back to the soft soft fluffy English muffins they were the day before. So far, I haven't tried anything else, but am definitely going to go back and try their other breads and cheeses.**note: If you are looking for pizza, it's next door. I accidentally came in here because I was in a hurry and saw the word cheese and thought this was Cheese Board Pizza. (silly me)TL;DR Cheese heaven"
484,"Good selection of cheese, bread and other sweet and savory snacks.  Coffee is decent. The sweet goodies aren't that sugary, which is a good thing for me. Store hours are short. Staff is polite but don't not friendly enough to spend much time with you explaining about the products."
485,"Wow, an array of cheeses and it was packed on a Saturday afternoon! I snuck into the bread line and got two cheese breads, a wolverine, and an olive focaccia bread. Only had the cheese breads, and my friend loved the burnt cheese all over it. It was a little too burnt and crunch for me, but it was really delicious! Fresh and warm out of the oven! Prices are really fair as well."
486,"Before there was Cheese Board Pizza there was the Cheese Board Collective.  They've been in Berkeley since 1967 and were, along w/ Peet's, the beginnings of the Gourmet Ghetto.  They became a worker owned co-op in 1971.  They were one of the first cheese shops I encountered as a young woman and they were probably the first bakery in Berkeley to make a proper baguette w/ the authentic texture.  In the beginning they were a cool little shop and over the decades they have grown into a powerhouse.  They still sell a wide variety of cheeses, but they also sell a rotating range of baked goods, most savory and some sweet and their iconic pizza.  The pizza is sold half baked to take home or ready to eat slices to eat there, or on the median strip, despite the signs.  We check their pizza offerings, which change daily, online and buy half a pizza to bake for dinner when it sounds good.  I have a separate review for Cheese Board Pizza, which has become our preferred pizza source because of their imaginative combinations.  The Cheese Board also has live music, one group at lunch, another at dinner, which is very cool"
487,"Even with the storm, this doesn't seem to deter the huge crowds on a Saturday morning wanting their gluten fix. Came here with the intent of buying some cheese, but ended up with a bag of baked goods, pizza, and their green sauce.  I'm obsessed with their green sauce, and will slather it on everything possible! So excited that the cheese shop carries them here for $4/container. They have tons of local and international cheeses, with samples available. They also carry Cowgirl Creamery! My favs: cheese rolls, provolone olive roll, and all their Cowgirl Creamery cheeses PRO TIP: They sell their half baked pizzas at the bakery as well, if you want to avoid the lines at their restaurant next door.

490,"Been around for years so they don't need validation from me - but the place is clean,consistent and the food is amazing! The food, specifically, being that daily chef chosen pizza!"
491,"My cousin brought me a tub of ricotta last night.It's now 8:44am the following day..and it's almost gone.Ricotta, bread, breakfast.This is the ricotta in the metal tin that they put in a plastic tub for you. Not too sure of the producer.But, I'm in cheese heaven."
492,This place is a national treasure as I have not been there for a while and only downside is closed Sunday. It only gets better with age  and the brioche is better than ever and the cheese bread is cheesier. Best of its type in USA.
493,"People say it's much better than Sliver but I can't really say. The pizza is great, and I think the cilantro sauce is less salty. I love how thin the crust is. Good for vegetarians.The band performing was absolutely beautiful."
494,"This place is amazing. Great variety of cheeses and all sorts of delights to pair them with from fresh baked breads to delicious jams and whole honeycombs. Parking is a bit of a free for all and you'll likely have to pay to park in a lot unless you can find street parking off to the side somewhere.At the cheese counter, pick up a playing card and when your card is called you get one on one treatment from a cheese expert. They have you try each cheese before buying as the taste can vary from batch to batch and even among wheels. I'm a big cheese fan so it was hard not to love everything I tried but I particularly enjoyed both the Swiss and French raclette and a very creamy brie that I can't recall the name of but Vicky can tell you as it is one of her favorites which she suggested to me.Aside from the cheese, we always pick up a whole honeycomb and a seeded baguette. Also popular are their cheese rolls which are a tasty sourdough with delicious cheese globs baked into it. I do prefer the cheese rolls at Acme though, where the cheese is blended in the dough and every bite is elasticy cheesy bready goodness."
495,"Excellent pastries and cheeses. Can recommend the cheese bread, carrot muffin and the cornbread sconces. Delicious!"
496,"Like I said in my last review, I did come back to try more muffins and a few ""chocolate things""! It was around 7:30 AM on a Friday and the place was already busy, but not enough to have a line :)**After the success of the apple apricot muffin last time, I picked a carrot spice muffin which was full of raisins, golden raisins, nuts, and of course carrots. Would recommend! **The chocolate things were also amazing, they're full of huge chocolate chunks rather than maybe a swirl, and the bread itself is soft and chewy. Make sure to eat the chocolate things while they're warm (i.e. Heat them up the next day) because otherwise they get kind of hard. **Also picked up a few scones -- 1 berry/lemon and 1 berry/corn (yum!! Texture is a mix between cornbread and scone) --  which were good but TL;DR if you can only pick a few things I'd definitely go for a muffin or chocolate thing."
497,Tasty healthy vegan pizza! It's harf to believe it isnt real cheese! Definetly stop by for fresh and hot pizza if youre In the area =) they also serve organic soft serve. yummm!
498,Can't go wrong with a pizza from here and their green sauce. Line can seem intimidating but it moves fast! The pro of serving only one flavor a day. Seating can be a game of chance but I haven't had any issues the times I've been.
499,Have only been here once and never knew about this amazing place. I love simple concepts like this. One flavor of pizza each day. Stand in line. Get your slice. And eat. My boyfriend and I tried this place out because he loves pizza. I cannot recall what the pizza flavor was for the day but it was simple and didn't have any fancy cheeses or veggies on there. We grabbed about four slices and two glasses of wine. Sat at a table near the open windows. Listened the a live band play during dinner.

531,"My cousin brought me a tub of ricotta last night.It's now 8:44am the following day..and it's almost gone.Ricotta, bread, breakfast.This is the ricotta in the metal tin that they put in a plastic tub for you. Not too sure of the producer.But, I'm in cheese heaven."
532,This place is a national treasure as I have not been there for a while and only downside is closed Sunday. It only gets better with age  and the brioche is better than ever and the cheese bread is cheesier. Best of its type in USA.
533,"People say it's much better than Sliver but I can't really say. The pizza is great, and I think the cilantro sauce is less salty. I love how thin the crust is. Good for vegetarians.The band performing was absolutely beautiful."
534,"This place is amazing. Great variety of cheeses and all sorts of delights to pair them with from fresh baked breads to delicious jams and whole honeycombs. Parking is a bit of a free for all and you'll likely have to pay to park in a lot unless you can find street parking off to the side somewhere.At the cheese counter, pick up a playing card and when your card is called you get one on one treatment from a cheese expert.

I'm a big cheese fan so it was hard not to love everything I tried but I particularly enjoyed both the Swiss and French raclette and a very creamy brie that I can't recall the name of but Vicky can tell you as it is one of her favorites which she suggested to me.Aside from the cheese, we always pick up a whole honeycomb and a seeded baguette. Also popular are their cheese rolls which are a tasty sourdough with delicious cheese globs baked into it. I do prefer the cheese rolls at Acme though, where the cheese is blended in the dough and every bite is elasticy cheesy bready goodness."
535,"Excellent pastries and cheeses. Can recommend the cheese bread, carrot muffin and the cornbread sconces. Delicious!"
536,"Like I said in my last review, I did come back to try more muffins and a few ""chocolate things""! It was around 7:30 AM on a Friday and the place was already busy, but not enough to have a line :)**After the success of the apple apricot muffin last time, I picked a carrot spice muffin which was full of raisins, golden raisins, nuts, and of course carrots. Would recommend! **The chocolate things were also amazing, they're full of huge chocolate chunks rather than maybe a swirl, and the bread itself is soft and chewy. Make sure to eat the chocolate things while they're warm (i.e. Heat them up the next day) because otherwise they get kind of hard. **Also picked up a few scones -- 1 berry/lemon and 1 berry/corn (yum!! Texture is a mix between cornbread and scone) --  which were good but TL;DR if you can only pick a few things I'd definitely go for a muffin or chocolate thing."
537,Tasty healthy vegan pizza! It's harf to believe it isnt real cheese! Definetly stop by for fresh and hot pizza if youre In the area =) they also serve organic soft serve. yummm!
538,Can't go wrong with a pizza from here and their green sauce. Line can seem intimidating but it moves fast! The pro of serving only one flavor a day. Seating can be a game of chance but I haven't had any issues the times I've been.
539,Have only been here once and never knew about this amazing place. I love simple concepts like this. One flavor of pizza each day. Stand in line. Get your slice. And eat. My boyfriend and I tried this place out because he loves pizza. I cannot recall what the pizza flavor was for the day but it was simple and didn't have any fancy cheeses or veggies on there. We grabbed about four slices and two glasses of wine. Sat at a table near the open windows. Listened the a live band play during dinner. And ended up sharing our table with a few strangers during the night.It was very casual. And comfortable. The food was great and the ambiance was chill. And it was cheap overall. They have a website if you don't want to be spontaneous. It displays their pizza flavor for the day. So if you want to know before you make the drive out there. It's convenient. Good luck! And don't forget to purchase the baked garlic. Yum!
540,"If you're here with family, friends, with two, solo, just buy the whole dang pizza because you'll regret not having the chance to scarf it down. Sure, you might have leftovers- take it home and freeze if it makes it until the next day. Or you can stand in line again for another half; the line is terribly long down the street, but the place is so efficient it will only take minutes. This pizza is good because of the dough. The dough is good because it is, in essence, bread. Good bread. Bread that can be eaten without the fripperies of tomato sauce, cheese, and whatever one topping they decide to do for the day. But they add this stuff to the good bread and it becomes a lovely pizza."
541,"When I told my LA friends I was heading up to Berkeley, two said this was the ""best"" place and that I ""must go."" They raved about the eggplant topping. Wait time & seating: Came around 2pm on a Saturday and the line took us about 20-30minutes. There is an incredibly limited amount of seating for the amount of people who come by, so get to praying before you arrive. We lucked out with seats by the live band, which was neat but made it difficult to talk without yelling. Pizza comes out incredibly fast, because they only serve one type per day. Food: I'm personally a fan of thicker, chewier crusts, so this was disappointing and didn't amount to the hype it received. It was average pizza with average, unmemorable toppings (the day I went). It's probably better other days, but not a fan of the ""take your chance"" game if I'm craving pizza one day. Price: For $24 (after tax), the pizza certainly wasn't worth it. More of a hype place, based on that day's pizza."
542,"I've heard about the Cheese Board from multiple friends for a long time but have not tried it until last week. We arrived around 11am and there were already a lot of people there because the bakery/cheese side is open by 8am. Even though the pizza side doesn't open until 11:30, there were already a lot of people waiting around for it. I recommend getting there early if you want to avoid a wait. People start to form an official line as soon as they open at 11:30.I didn't try and of the cheese but the bakery side had lots of good bread and baked goods options. We ended up buying the Sunday Bread, scone, chocolate things, and the Ginger Molasses cookie. All of them were really good! The Sunday bread and chocolate things can be a bit dense and dry if you eat it the next day but I found microwaving them to be a good way to enjoy them :) I found out that the Cheese Board only makes one flavor a day. The pizza of the day was with roasted potatoes (carbs on carbs), caramelized onions, mozzarella, and cave aged gruyere, cheese, garlic olive oil, parsley, and oregano. Even though they only make one flavor a day they do have vegan options. The pizzas were very reasonably priced, at $3 slice. When I got the pizza it was  burning hot, which is not necessarily a bad thing but I found it hard to even leave it on my lap when I was trying to eat it in their outdoor seating area. Even though I'm not usually a pizza fan, I enjoyed the pizza here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the area again.Pros:- Bakery and Cheese shop open early, can shop there while waiting for the pizza- Half baked pizza available at the bakery- Fresh pizza - Vegetarian and Vegan optionsCons:- Only one flavor so if you don't like it then there's not much of an alternative- Long lines and really crowded - Staffs are not the friendliest people, don't really bother to greet you or even smile- Pizza on the oily size so make sure to grab napkins!"
543,"If you a cheese lover, you have to come here. They have so many cheeses I didn't even know existed.They also have a large variety of breads, though not as extravagant as their cheese selection. I got 6 English muffins for $5.50. I'm not a big fan of English muffins, but they were the best English muffins I've ever had. I ate one right when I got them, and put the rest in the fridge hoping they would still be fluffy. When I took them out of the fridge, they were rock hard, but I popped them in the fridge. Like magic, they were back to the soft soft fluffy English muffins they were the day before. So far, I haven't tried anything else, but am definitely going to go back and try their other breads and cheeses.**note: If you are looking for pizza, it's next door. I accidentally came in here because I was in a hurry and saw the word cheese and thought this was Cheese Board Pizza. (silly me)TL;DR Cheese heaven"
544,"Good selection of cheese, bread and other sweet and savory snacks.  Coffee is decent. The sweet goodies aren't that sugary, which is a good thing for me. Store hours are short. Staff is polite but don't not friendly enough to spend much time with you explaining about the products."
545,"Wow, an array of cheeses and it was packed on a Saturday afternoon! I snuck into the bread line and got two cheese breads, a wolverine, and an olive focaccia bread. Only had the cheese breads, and my friend loved the burnt cheese all over it. It was a little too burnt and crunch for me, but it was really delicious! Fresh and warm out of the oven! Prices are really fair as well."
546,"Before there was Cheese Board Pizza there was the Cheese Board Collective.  They've been in Berkeley since 1967 and were, along w/ Peet's, the beginnings of the Gourmet Ghetto.  They became a worker owned co-op in 1971.  They were one of the first cheese shops I encountered as a young woman and they were probably the first bakery in Berkeley to make a proper baguette w/ the authentic texture.  In the beginning they were a cool little shop and over the decades they have grown into a powerhouse.  They still sell a wide variety of cheeses, but they also sell a rotating range of baked goods, most savory and some sweet and their iconic pizza.  The pizza is sold half baked to take home or ready to eat slices to eat there, or on the median strip, despite the signs.  We check their pizza offerings, which change daily, online and buy half a pizza to bake for dinner when it sounds good.  I have a separate review for Cheese Board Pizza, which has become our preferred pizza source because of their imaginative combinations.  The Cheese Board also has live music, one group at lunch, another at dinner, which is very cool"
547,"Even with the storm, this doesn't seem to deter the huge crowds on a Saturday morning wanting their gluten fix. Came here with the intent of buying some cheese, but ended up with a bag of baked goods, pizza, and their green sauce.  I'm obsessed with their green sauce, and will slather it on everything possible! So excited that the cheese shop carries them here for $4/container. They have tons of local and international cheeses, with samples available. They also carry Cowgirl Creamery! My favs: cheese rolls, provolone olive roll, and all their Cowgirl Creamery cheeses PRO TIP: They sell their half baked pizzas at the bakery as well, if you want to avoid the lines at their restaurant next door. However, there's lines here too, but they move quick!"
548,"It was my very first time here yesterday and I was shocked at how many people were waiting in line for this pizza. I thought to myself, wow is it really that good?

Even though I'm not usually a pizza fan, I enjoyed the pizza here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the area again.Pros:- Bakery and Cheese shop open early, can shop there while waiting for the pizza- Half baked pizza available at the bakery- Fresh pizza - Vegetarian and Vegan optionsCons:- Only one flavor so if you don't like it then there's not much of an alternative- Long lines and really crowded - Staffs are not the friendliest people, don't really bother to greet you or even smile- Pizza on the oily size so make sure to grab napkins!"
583,"If you a cheese lover, you have to come here. They have so many cheeses I didn't even know existed.They also have a large variety of breads, though not as extravagant as their cheese selection. I got 6 English muffins for $5.50. I'm not a big fan of English muffins, but they were the best English muffins I've ever had. I ate one right when I got them, and put the rest in the fridge hoping they would still be fluffy. When I took them out of the fridge, they were rock hard, but I popped them in the fridge. Like magic, they were back to the soft soft fluffy English muffins they were the day before. So far, I haven't tried anything else, but am definitely going to go back and try their other breads and cheeses.**note: If you are looking for pizza, it's next door. I accidentally came in here because I was in a hurry and saw the word cheese and thought this was Cheese Board Pizza. (silly me)TL;DR Cheese heaven"
584,"Good selection of cheese, bread and other sweet and savory snacks.  Coffee is decent. The sweet goodies aren't that sugary, which is a good thing for me. Store hours are short. Staff is polite but don't not friendly enough to spend much time with you explaining about the products."
585,"Wow, an array of cheeses and it was packed on a Saturday afternoon! I snuck into the bread line and got two cheese breads, a wolverine, and an olive focaccia bread. Only had the cheese breads, and my friend loved the burnt cheese all over it. It was a little too burnt and crunch for me, but it was really delicious! Fresh and warm out of the oven! Prices are really fair as well."
586,"Before there was Cheese Board Pizza there was the Cheese Board Collective.  They've been in Berkeley since 1967 and were, along w/ Peet's, the beginnings of the Gourmet Ghetto.  They became a worker owned co-op in 1971.  They were one of the first cheese shops I encountered as a young woman and they were probably the first bakery in Berkeley to make a proper baguette w/ the authentic texture.  In the beginning they were a cool little shop and over the decades they have grown into a powerhouse.  They still sell a wide variety of cheeses, but they also sell a rotating range of baked goods, most savory and some sweet and their iconic pizza.  The pizza is sold half baked to take home or ready to eat slices to eat there, or on the median strip, despite the signs.  We check their pizza offerings, which change daily, online and buy half a pizza to bake for dinner when it sounds good.  I have a separate review for Cheese Board Pizza, which has become our preferred pizza source because of their imaginative combinations.  The Cheese Board also has live music, one group at lunch, another at dinner, which is very cool"
587,"Even with the storm, this doesn't seem to deter the huge crowds on a Saturday morning wanting their gluten fix. Came here with the intent of buying some cheese, but ended up with a bag of baked goods, pizza, and their green sauce.  I'm obsessed with their green sauce, and will slather it on everything possible! So excited that the cheese shop carries them here for $4/container. They have tons of local and international cheeses, with samples available. They also carry Cowgirl Creamery! My favs: cheese rolls, provolone olive roll, and all their Cowgirl Creamery cheeses PRO TIP: They sell their half baked pizzas at the bakery as well, if you want to avoid the lines at their restaurant next door. However, there's lines here too, but they move quick!"
588,"It was my very first time here yesterday and I was shocked at how many people were waiting in line for this pizza. I thought to myself, wow is it really that good? Lol well it definitely was tasty! I've never had a pizza like this! The flavor was so tangy and delicious definitely worth the 25 min wait!"
589,"- Had a special ""Pride Celebration"" pizza... Heirloom tomato, red onion, mozzarella and aged Asiago cheese, garlic olive oil, parsley, oregano. Highly recommend it.- A little on the cheesy side for my own liking...but thats to be expected given the name, and the cheese was amazing. - Very reasonably priced...2/3 people can split a large pizza and it comes to $22 total. - Also has exclusively vegetarian options...which is a win in my book :) - Overall one of the best pizzas I've had in the Bay."
590,"Been around for years so they don't need validation from me - but the place is clean,consistent and the food is amazing! The food, specifically, being that daily chef chosen pizza!"
591,"My cousin brought me a tub of ricotta last night.It's now 8:44am the following day..and it's almost gone.Ricotta, bread, breakfast.This is the ricotta in the metal tin that they put in a plastic tub for you. Not too sure of the producer.But, I'm in cheese heaven."
592,This place is a national treasure as I have not been there for a while and only downside is closed Sunday. It only gets better with age  and the brioche is better than ever and the cheese bread is cheesier. Best of its type in USA.
593,"People say it's much better than Sliver but I can't really say. The pizza is great, and I think the cilantro sauce is less salty. I love how thin the crust is. Good for vegetarians.The band performing was absolutely beautiful."
594,"This place is amazing. Great variety of cheeses and all sorts of delights to pair them with from fresh baked breads to delicious jams and whole honeycombs. Parking is a bit of a free for all and you'll likely have to pay to park in a lot unless you can find street parking off to the side somewhere.At the cheese counter, pick up a playing card and when your card is called you get one on one treatment from a cheese expert. They have you try each cheese before buying as the taste can vary from batch to batch and even among wheels. I'm a big cheese fan so it was hard not to love everything I tried but I particularly enjoyed both the Swiss and French raclette and a very creamy brie that I can't recall the name of but Vicky can tell you as it is one of her favorites which she suggested to me.Aside from the cheese, we always pick up a whole honeycomb and a seeded baguette. Also popular are their cheese rolls which are a tasty sourdough with delicious cheese globs baked into it. I do prefer the cheese rolls at Acme though, where the cheese is blended in the dough and every bite is elasticy cheesy bready goodness."
595,"Excellent pastries and cheeses. Can recommend the cheese bread, carrot muffin and the cornbread sconces. Delicious!"
596,"Like I said in my last review, I did come back to try more muffins and a few ""chocolate things""! It was around 7:30 AM on a Friday and the place was already busy, but not enough to have a line :)**After the success of the apple apricot muffin last time, I picked a carrot spice muffin which was full of raisins, golden raisins, nuts, and of course carrots. Would recommend! **The chocolate things were also amazing, they're full of huge chocolate chunks rather than maybe a swirl, and the bread itself is soft and chewy. Make sure to eat the chocolate things while they're warm (i.e. Heat them up the next day) because otherwise they get kind of hard. **Also picked up a few scones -- 1 berry/lemon and 1 berry/corn (yum!! Texture is a mix between cornbread and scone) --  which were good but TL;DR if you can only pick a few things I'd definitely go for a muffin or chocolate thing."
597,Tasty healthy vegan pizza! It's harf to believe it isnt real cheese! Definetly stop by for fresh and hot pizza if youre In the area =) they also serve organic soft serve. yummm!
598,Can't go wrong with a pizza from here and their green sauce. Line can seem intimidating but it moves fast! The pro of serving only one flavor a day. Seating can be a game of chance but I haven't had any issues the times I've been.
599,Have only been here once and never knew about this amazing place. I love simple concepts like this. One flavor of pizza each day. Stand in line. Get your slice. And eat. My boyfriend and I tried this place out because he loves pizza. I cannot recall what the pizza flavor was for the day but it was simple and didn't have any fancy cheeses or veggies on there. We grabbed about four slices and two glasses of wine. Sat at a table near the open windows. Listened the a live band play during dinner. And ended up sharing our table with a few strangers during the night.It was very casual. And comfortable. The food was great and the ambiance was chill. And it was cheap overall. They have a website if you don't want to be spontaneous. It displays their pizza flavor for the day. So if you want to know before you make the drive out there. It's convenient. Good luck! And don't forget to purchase the baked garlic. Yum!
600,"If you're here with family, friends, with two, solo, just buy the whole dang pizza because you'll regret not having the chance to scarf it down. Sure, you might have leftovers- take it home and freeze if it makes it until the next day. Or you can stand in line again for another half; the line is terribly long down the street, but the place is so efficient it will only take minutes. This pizza is good because of the dough. The dough is good because it is, in essence, bread. Good bread. Bread that can be eaten without the fripperies of tomato sauce, cheese, and whatever one topping they decide to do for the day. But they add this stuff to the good bread and it becomes a lovely pizza."
601,"When I told my LA friends I was heading up to Berkeley, two said this was the ""best"" place and that I ""must go."" They raved about the eggplant topping. Wait time & seating: Came around 2pm on a Saturday and the line took us about 20-30minutes. There is an incredibly limited amount of seating for the amount of people who come by, so get to praying before you arrive. We lucked out with seats by the live band, which was neat but made it difficult to talk without yelling. Pizza comes out incredibly fast, because they only serve one type per day. Food: I'm personally a fan of thicker, chewier crusts, so this was disappointing and didn't amount to the hype it received. It was average pizza with average, unmemorable toppings (the day I went). It's probably better other days, but not a fan of the ""take your chance"" game if I'm craving pizza one day. Price: For $24 (after tax), the pizza certainly wasn't worth it. More of a hype place, based on that day's pizza."
602,"I've heard about the Cheese Board from multiple friends for a long time but have not tried it until last week. We arrived around 11am and there were already a lot of people there because the bakery/cheese side is open by 8am. Even though the pizza side doesn't open until 11:30, there were already a lot of people waiting around for it. I recommend getting there early if you want to avoid a wait. People start to form an official line as soon as they open at 11:30.I didn't try and of the cheese but the bakery side had lots of good bread and baked goods options. We ended up buying the Sunday Bread, scone, chocolate things, and the Ginger Molasses cookie. All of them were really good! The Sunday bread and chocolate things can be a bit dense and dry if you eat it the next day but I found microwaving them to be a good way to enjoy them :) I found out that the Cheese Board only makes one flavor a day. The pizza of the day was with roasted potatoes (carbs on carbs), caramelized onions, mozzarella, and cave aged gruyere, cheese, garlic olive oil, parsley, and oregano. Even though they only make one flavor a day they do have vegan options. The pizzas were very reasonably priced, at $3 slice. When I got the pizza it was  burning hot, which is not necessarily a bad thing but I found it hard to even leave it on my lap when I was trying to eat it in their outdoor seating area.

638,Can't go wrong with a pizza from here and their green sauce. Line can seem intimidating but it moves fast! The pro of serving only one flavor a day. Seating can be a game of chance but I haven't had any issues the times I've been.
639,Have only been here once and never knew about this amazing place. I love simple concepts like this. One flavor of pizza each day. Stand in line. Get your slice. And eat. My boyfriend and I tried this place out because he loves pizza. I cannot recall what the pizza flavor was for the day but it was simple and didn't have any fancy cheeses or veggies on there. We grabbed about four slices and two glasses of wine. Sat at a table near the open windows. Listened the a live band play during dinner. And ended up sharing our table with a few strangers during the night.It was very casual. And comfortable. The food was great and the ambiance was chill. And it was cheap overall. They have a website if you don't want to be spontaneous. It displays their pizza flavor for the day. So if you want to know before you make the drive out there. It's convenient. Good luck! And don't forget to purchase the baked garlic. Yum!
640,"If you're here with family, friends, with two, solo, just buy the whole dang pizza because you'll regret not having the chance to scarf it down. Sure, you might have leftovers- take it home and freeze if it makes it until the next day. Or you can stand in line again for another half; the line is terribly long down the street, but the place is so efficient it will only take minutes. This pizza is good because of the dough. The dough is good because it is, in essence, bread. Good bread. Bread that can be eaten without the fripperies of tomato sauce, cheese, and whatever one topping they decide to do for the day. But they add this stuff to the good bread and it becomes a lovely pizza."
641,"When I told my LA friends I was heading up to Berkeley, two said this was the ""best"" place and that I ""must go."" They raved about the eggplant topping. Wait time & seating: Came around 2pm on a Saturday and the line took us about 20-30minutes. There is an incredibly limited amount of seating for the amount of people who come by, so get to praying before you arrive. We lucked out with seats by the live band, which was neat but made it difficult to talk without yelling. Pizza comes out incredibly fast, because they only serve one type per day. Food: I'm personally a fan of thicker, chewier crusts, so this was disappointing and didn't amount to the hype it received. It was average pizza with average, unmemorable toppings (the day I went). It's probably better other days, but not a fan of the ""take your chance"" game if I'm craving pizza one day. Price: For $24 (after tax), the pizza certainly wasn't worth it. More of a hype place, based on that day's pizza."
642,"I've heard about the Cheese Board from multiple friends for a long time but have not tried it until last week. We arrived around 11am and there were already a lot of people there because the bakery/cheese side is open by 8am. Even though the pizza side doesn't open until 11:30, there were already a lot of people waiting around for it. I recommend getting there early if you want to avoid a wait. People start to form an official line as soon as they open at 11:30.I didn't try and of the cheese but the bakery side had lots of good bread and baked goods options. We ended up buying the Sunday Bread, scone, chocolate things, and the Ginger Molasses cookie. All of them were really good! The Sunday bread and chocolate things can be a bit dense and dry if you eat it the next day but I found microwaving them to be a good way to enjoy them :) I found out that the Cheese Board only makes one flavor a day. The pizza of the day was with roasted potatoes (carbs on carbs), caramelized onions, mozzarella, and cave aged gruyere, cheese, garlic olive oil, parsley, and oregano. Even though they only make one flavor a day they do have vegan options. The pizzas were very reasonably priced, at $3 slice. When I got the pizza it was  burning hot, which is not necessarily a bad thing but I found it hard to even leave it on my lap when I was trying to eat it in their outdoor seating area. Even though I'm not usually a pizza fan, I enjoyed the pizza here and would consider coming back if I'm ever in the area again.Pros:- Bakery and Cheese shop open early, can shop there while waiting for the pizza- Half baked pizza available at the bakery- Fresh pizza - Vegetarian and Vegan optionsCons:- Only one flavor so if you don't like it then there's not much of an alternative- Long lines and really crowded - Staffs are not the friendliest people, don't really bother to greet you or even smile- Pizza on the oily size so make sure to grab napkins!"
643,"If you a cheese lover, you have to come here. They have so many cheeses I didn't even know existed.They also have a large variety of breads, though not as extravagant as their cheese selection. I got 6 English muffins for $5.50. I'm not a big fan of English muffins, but they were the best English muffins I've ever had. I ate one right when I got them, and put the rest in the fridge hoping they would still be fluffy. When I took them out of the fridge, they were rock hard, but I popped them in the fridge. Like magic, they were back to the soft soft fluffy English muffins they were the day before. So far, I haven't tried anything else, but am definitely going to go back and try their other breads and cheeses.**note: If you are looking for pizza, it's next door. I accidentally came in here because I was in a hurry and saw the word cheese and thought this was Cheese Board Pizza. (silly me)TL;DR Cheese heaven"
644,"Good selection of cheese, bread and other sweet and savory snacks.  Coffee is decent. The sweet goodies aren't that sugary, which is a good thing for me. Store hours are short. Staff is polite but don't not friendly enough to spend much time with you explaining about the products."
645,"Wow, an array of cheeses and it was packed on a Saturday afternoon! I snuck into the bread line and got two cheese breads, a wolverine, and an olive focaccia bread. Only had the cheese breads, and my friend loved the burnt cheese all over it. It was a little too burnt and crunch for me, but it was really delicious! Fresh and warm out of the oven! Prices are really fair as well."
646,"Before there was Cheese Board Pizza there was the Cheese Board Collective.  They've been in Berkeley since 1967 and were, along w/ Peet's, the beginnings of the Gourmet Ghetto.  They became a worker owned co-op in 1971.  They were one of the first cheese shops I encountered as a young woman and they were probably the first bakery in Berkeley to make a proper baguette w/ the authentic texture.  In the beginning they were a cool little shop and over the decades they have grown into a powerhouse.  They still sell a wide variety of cheeses, but they also sell a rotating range of baked goods, most savory and some sweet and their iconic pizza.  The pizza is sold half baked to take home or ready to eat slices to eat there, or on the median strip, despite the signs.  We check their pizza offerings, which change daily, online and buy half a pizza to bake for dinner when it sounds good.  I have a separate review for Cheese Board Pizza, which has become our preferred pizza source because of their imaginative combinations.  The Cheese Board also has live music, one group at lunch, another at dinner, which is very cool"
647,"Even with the storm, this doesn't seem to deter the huge crowds on a Saturday morning wanting their gluten fix. Came here with the intent of buying some cheese, but ended up with a bag of baked goods, pizza, and their green sauce.  I'm obsessed with their green sauce, and will slather it on everything possible! So excited that the cheese shop carries them here for $4/container. They have tons of local and international cheeses, with samples available. They also carry Cowgirl Creamery! My favs: cheese rolls, provolone olive roll, and all their Cowgirl Creamery cheeses PRO TIP: They sell their half baked pizzas at the bakery as well, if you want to avoid the lines at their restaurant next door. However, there's lines here too, but they move quick!"
648,"It was my very first time here yesterday and I was shocked at how many people were waiting in line for this pizza. I thought to myself, wow is it really that good? Lol well it definitely was tasty! I've never had a pizza like this! The flavor was so tangy and delicious definitely worth the 25 min wait!"
649,"- Had a special ""Pride Celebration"" pizza... Heirloom tomato, red onion, mozzarella and aged Asiago cheese, garlic olive oil, parsley, oregano. Highly recommend it.- A little on the cheesy side for my own liking...but thats to be expected given the name, and the cheese was amazing. - Very reasonably priced...2/3 people can split a large pizza and it comes to $22 total. - Also has exclusively vegetarian options...which is a win in my book :) - Overall one of the best pizzas I've had in the Bay."
650,"Been around for years so they don't need validation from me - but the place is clean,consistent and the food is amazing! The food, specifically, being that daily chef chosen pizza!"
651,"My cousin brought me a tub of ricotta last night.It's now 8:44am the following day..and it's almost gone.Ricotta, bread, breakfast.This is the ricotta in the metal tin that they put in a plastic tub for you. Not too sure of the producer.But, I'm in cheese heaven."
652,This place is a national treasure as I have not been there for a while and only downside is closed Sunday. It only gets better with age  and the brioche is better than ever and the cheese bread is cheesier. Best of its type in USA.
653,"People say it's much better than Sliver but I can't really say. The pizza is great, and I think the cilantro sauce is less salty. I love how thin the crust is. Good for vegetarians.The band performing was absolutely beautiful."
654,"This place is amazing. Great variety of cheeses and all sorts of delights to pair them with from fresh baked breads to delicious jams and whole honeycombs. Parking is a bit of a free for all and you'll likely have to pay to park in a lot unless you can find street parking off to the side somewhere.At the cheese counter, pick up a playing card and when your card is called you get one on one treatment from a cheese expert. They have you try each cheese before buying as the taste can vary from batch to batch and even among wheels. I'm a big cheese fan so it was hard not to love everything I tried but I particularly enjoyed both the Swiss and French raclette and a very creamy brie that I can't recall the name of but Vicky can tell you as it is one of her favorites which she suggested to me.Aside from the cheese, we always pick up a whole honeycomb and a seeded baguette. Also popular are their cheese rolls which are a tasty sourdough with delicious cheese globs baked into it. I do prefer the cheese rolls at Acme though, where the cheese is blended in the dough and every bite is elasticy cheesy bready goodness."
655,"Excellent pastries and cheeses. Can recommend the cheese bread, carrot muffin and the cornbread sconces. Delicious!"
656,"Like I said in my last review, I did come back to try more muffins and a few ""chocolate things""! It was around 7:30 AM on a Friday and the place was already busy, but not enough to have a line :)**After the success of the apple apricot muffin last time, I picked a carrot spice muffin which was full of raisins, golden raisins, nuts, and of course carrots. Would recommend! **The chocolate things were also amazing, they're full of huge chocolate chunks rather than maybe a swirl, and the bread itself is soft and chewy. Make sure to eat the chocolate things while they're warm (i.e. Heat them up the next day) because otherwise they get kind of hard. **Also picked up a few scones -- 1 berry/lemon and 1 berry/corn (yum!! Texture is a mix between cornbread and scone) --  which were good but TL;DR if you can only pick a few things I'd definitely go for a muffin or chocolate thing."

However, there's lines here too, but they move quick!"

Lol well it definitely was tasty! I've never had a pizza like this! The flavor was so tangy and delicious definitely worth the 25 min wait!"
689,"- Had a special ""Pride Celebration"" pizza... Heirloom tomato, red onion, mozzarella and aged Asiago cheese, garlic olive oil, parsley, oregano. Highly recommend it.- A little on the cheesy side for my own liking...but thats to be expected given the name, and the cheese was amazing. - Very reasonably priced...2/3 people can split a large pizza and it comes to $22 total. - Also has exclusively vegetarian options...which is a win in my book :) - Overall one of the best pizzas I've had in the Bay."
690,"Been around for years so they don't need validation from me - but the place is clean,consistent and the food is amazing! The food, specifically, being that daily chef chosen pizza!"
691,"My cousin brought me a tub of ricotta last night.It's now 8:44am the following day..and it's almost gone.Ricotta, bread, breakfast.This is the ricotta in the metal tin that they put in a plastic tub for you. Not too sure of the producer.But, I'm in cheese heaven."
692,This place is a national treasure as I have not been there for a while and only downside is closed Sunday. It only gets better with age  and the brioche is better than ever and the cheese bread is cheesier. Best of its type in USA.
693,"People say it's much better than Sliver but I can't really say. The pizza is great, and I think the cilantro sauce is less salty. I love how thin the crust is. Good for vegetarians.The band performing was absolutely beautiful."
694,"This place is amazing. Great variety of cheeses and all sorts of delights to pair them with from fresh baked breads to delicious jams and whole honeycombs. Parking is a bit of a free for all and you'll likely have to pay to park in a lot unless you can find street parking off to the side somewhere.At the cheese counter, pick up a playing card and when your card is called you get one on one treatment from a cheese expert. They have you try each cheese before buying as the taste can vary from batch to batch and even among wheels. I'm a big cheese fan so it was hard not to love everything I tried but I particularly enjoyed both the Swiss and French raclette and a very creamy brie that I can't recall the name of but Vicky can tell you as it is one of her favorites which she suggested to me.Aside from the cheese, we always pick up a whole honeycomb and a seeded baguette. Also popular are their cheese rolls which are a tasty sourdough with delicious cheese globs baked into it. I do prefer the cheese rolls at Acme though, where the cheese is blended in the dough and every bite is elasticy cheesy bready goodness."
695,"Excellent pastries and cheeses. Can recommend the cheese bread, carrot muffin and the cornbread sconces. Delicious!"
696,"Like I said in my last review, I did come back to try more muffins and a few ""chocolate things""! It was around 7:30 AM on a Friday and the place was already busy, but not enough to have a line :)**After the success of the apple apricot muffin last time, I picked a carrot spice muffin which was full of raisins, golden raisins, nuts, and of course carrots. Would recommend! **The chocolate things were also amazing, they're full of huge chocolate chunks rather than maybe a swirl, and the bread itself is soft and chewy. Make sure to eat the chocolate things while they're warm (i.e. Heat them up the next day) because otherwise they get kind of hard. **Also picked up a few scones -- 1 berry/lemon and 1 berry/corn (yum!! Texture is a mix between cornbread and scone) --  which were good but TL;DR if you can only pick a few things I'd definitely go for a muffin or chocolate thing."
697,Tasty healthy vegan pizza! It's harf to believe it isnt real cheese! Definetly stop by for fresh and hot pizza if youre In the area =) they also serve organic soft serve. yummm!
698,Can't go wrong with a pizza from here and their green sauce. Line can seem intimidating but it moves fast! The pro of serving only one flavor a day. Seating can be a game of chance but I haven't had any issues the times I've been.
699,Have only been here once and never knew about this amazing place. I love simple concepts like this. One flavor of pizza each day. Stand in line. Get your slice. And eat. My boyfriend and I tried this place out because he loves pizza. I cannot recall what the pizza flavor was for the day but it was simple and didn't have any fancy cheeses or veggies on there. We grabbed about four slices and two glasses of wine. Sat at a table near the open windows. Listened the a live band play during dinner. And ended up sharing our table with a few strangers during the night.It was very casual. And comfortable. The food was great and the ambiance was chill. And it was cheap overall. They have a website if you don't want to be spontaneous. It displays their pizza flavor for the day. So if you want to know before you make the drive out there. It's convenient. Good luck! And don't forget to purchase the baked garlic. Yum!
