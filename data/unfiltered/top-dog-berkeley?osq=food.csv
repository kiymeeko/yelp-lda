1,"Went here TODAY and had a hot link. The grill was dirty and the burned, overcooked, soot covered sausage discolored the bun and tasted bitter. I don't remember it ever being that bad. Maybe they are stressed out from all the recent media attention?I have been going here for years and never thought much or paid attention to the libertarian slogans posted all around but today I couldn't help but feel like there were suspicious characters posted up inside the hotdog stand. If this place is going to become a hangout for the alt right then I will NEVER go back."
2,Horrifying unclean interior with store-bought quality hot dogs. Couldn't tell the difference between the cold dog six-packs and one fresh from the grill.
3,"Good brauts and brots (there's a difference between the two you can find out here) esp for late night drunk Berkeley students due to late night opening hours...the guy working the grill was pretty chill and puts videos of whatever he wants to hear about while he cooks, when I came it was something about voting, all in all, good vibes and snack sized bites good for pre dinner pre game."
4,Dude. I've eaten a lot of Top Dog over the years. The spicy dog is okay... but not good enough.Didn't realize until looking at their website that their ENTIRE BLOG is devoted to maintaining neo-nazi ideals. Yikes. Not sure how this place has survived in Berkeley (of all places) for so long.Literally get ANY OTHER FOOD. It's not worth it. topdoghotdogs.com/proper…
5,"There are few restaurants on the South side of the Berkeley campus that have lasted more than 40 years, and this is one of three that I remember. (Yogurt Park and Kip's are the other two.)This restaurant is a lot cleaner than it was when I used to frequent it in the late 70's. The restaurant is a one person operation. The chef takes your order, collects, your money and cooks your dog. They have a good variety of sausages and dogs that are served hot. Condiments are on the counter for you. There was a steady flow of customers.My hot dog tasted good on a toasted bun and seemed reasonably priced at a little over $3.00. However, it was smaller than I had hoped. Overall, it seemed a good value for an afternoon snack."

7,"Now that the nazi no longer is employed, I can continue being a patron at this place.There are a variety of dogs, it is open late, and is super affordable.  All great things in my book!"

10,"I think Top dog should make some kind of statementABOUT HOW THEIR HOT DOGS ARE NAZI SNACKUMSno but for real, they hired white supremacist and it smells like deep fried buttholes there. Costco has better dogs and no white power douche bags working there."
11,Hopefully this restaurant knows what they are doing by hiring a nazi wannabe. So damaging with all of us knowing who he is and what they stand for. I hope something comes of this...

13,"My buddy who went to Cal, told me that I needed to go here.  I love hot dogs, so it was right up my alley.  We were headed over to Zachary's, but made a pit stop here to grab a dog. First of all, this place is tiny!  One man operation.  I walked in, ordered 2 Top Dogs, dressed them up, and was on my way.  Here is what I thought about the dog................Top Dog-  When you order your dog, they pull your encased meats from the pile of sausages cooking over to the right.  They throw your dog on the ""hot side"" of the grill and cook it, slap it between a bun (which is also toasted on the griddle) and then you are in charge of your own toppings.  I went basic with just mustard and onions.  I went mustard, onions and relish for my mom and brothers dog (they split one).  What did I think?  It was pretty darn good!  They use a natural casing dog, so you get the ""snap"".  The dogs are pretty long, and hang out both ends of the bun. About that one........They actually use a little loaf of seeded bread.  Surprisingly it works really well!  The bun to dog ratio is just a bit off, but it's still a mighty fine hot dog, regardless.  I ate my dog in the car, and we were on our way.I could definitely see how my buddy loved this place.  Is it replacing Ted's or Wieners Circle as my best/favorite hot dog in the land?  No.  Is it a very good dog that I would come back to often if I lived in Berkeley?  Yes!  I was glad I stopped!"
14,"As long as you are hiring this NeoNazi we are going to boycott you! I saw him on Twitter, this is a wrong sentiment for the community. I urge the owners to fire that Neo Nazi!"
15,"Top Dog seems to be a Berkeley landmark that all my Golden Bear friends told me to check out once if in the area, and I happen to be around. I became a fanboy in 2 dogs flat...Service: 2 guys working the grill and the register on a busy Saturday night.  They kept the orders moving and seemed like seasoned veterans at Top Dog.  Nice work guys.Hot Dogs:  I tried the ""Top Dog""  and the Hot Link.  Both very tasty and I was really digging the hot link with the peppers.  Spicy and flavorful yes, but not too much to jack me up sitting down on the throne a couple of hours later.   All the flavoring is in the dog itself.  Buns were toasted which helped the dog and the dogs were cooked properly.  Nothing fancy, just tasty af..Value: $3.50 for just a dog and bun.  Condiments are free of course and the size of the dog and bun are on the medium/smaller size.  The perfect size where buying one isn't enough for a meal but perfect for a snack.  Snacky snack sized is my description, or maybe I'm just a fatty...Ambiance and Location: It's a small little hot dog joint to pick up a couple of dogs and eat while hanging out in the street with your friends or on the go.  I bet these dogs are great at 2 AM after a night of drinking and dancing.Are the hot dogs tasty with a very good toasted bun?  Yes, no doubt.  Would I make a trip out to  find them, find parking, and possibly get stuck in a long line?  Probably not.  But if I'm in the Berkeley area, definitely looking to pick up a couple of dogs from mf Top Dog to enjoy.  Good times ya'll..good times.."
16,"Great for a late night snack. Visited here on the way back after a recommendation from a friend.  I had the German Frankfurter and it was delicious! Food: The bun was a delicious crunchy pretzel roll, which was my favorite part of the hot dog. The meat itself was ok. I think for me it was more of the sides and roll that made the hot dog delicious.Location: We came around 9-10pm on a Friday night and it was easy to find parking. All street parking, and it's near tons of other delicious restaurants!Love the location, food was great."
17,"I have been here before and it was ok. The last time I went, I became violently ill about 1/2-1 hour after. Stomach was in knots for 36 hours. I'll never go back again."

Just not a place I would ever want to contribute to other help grow. I understand Cole may not longer be employed there, but posting racist propaganda on their blog is inexcusable."
19,"I won't be eating here again. I've gone here a few times before shows at the Greek but not anymore. The food is okay but their ideals aren't. They might fire neo-Nazi employees, but take a gander at the ""propagander"" section of their website."

About that one........They actually use a little loaf of seeded bread.  Surprisingly it works really well!  The bun to dog ratio is just a bit off, but it's still a mighty fine hot dog, regardless.  I ate my dog in the car, and we were on our way.I could definitely see how my buddy loved this place.  Is it replacing Ted's or Wieners Circle as my best/favorite hot dog in the land?  No.  Is it a very good dog that I would come back to often if I lived in Berkeley?  Yes!  I was glad I stopped!"

First of all, this place is tiny!  One man operation.  I walked in, ordered 2 Top Dogs, dressed them up, and was on my way.  Here is what I thought about the dog................Top Dog-  When you order your dog, they pull your encased meats from the pile of sausages cooking over to the right.  They throw your dog on the ""hot side"" of the grill and cook it, slap it between a bun (which is also toasted on the griddle) and then you are in charge of your own toppings.  I went basic with just mustard and onions.  I went mustard, onions and relish for my mom and brothers dog (they split one).  What did I think?  It was pretty darn good!  They use a natural casing dog, so you get the ""snap"".  The dogs are pretty long, and hang out both ends of the bun. About that one........They actually use a little loaf of seeded bread.  Surprisingly it works really well!  The bun to dog ratio is just a bit off, but it's still a mighty fine hot dog, regardless.  I ate my dog in the car, and we were on our way.I could definitely see how my buddy loved this place.  Is it replacing Ted's or Wieners Circle as my best/favorite hot dog in the land?  No.  Is it a very good dog that I would come back to often if I lived in Berkeley?  Yes!  I was glad I stopped!"

About that one........They actually use a little loaf of seeded bread.  Surprisingly it works really well!  The bun to dog ratio is just a bit off, but it's still a mighty fine hot dog, regardless.  I ate my dog in the car, and we were on our way.I could definitely see how my buddy loved this place.  Is it replacing Ted's or Wieners Circle as my best/favorite hot dog in the land?  No.  Is it a very good dog that I would come back to often if I lived in Berkeley?  Yes!  I was glad I stopped!"

About that one........They actually use a little loaf of seeded bread.  Surprisingly it works really well!  The bun to dog ratio is just a bit off, but it's still a mighty fine hot dog, regardless.  I ate my dog in the car, and we were on our way.I could definitely see how my buddy loved this place.  Is it replacing Ted's or Wieners Circle as my best/favorite hot dog in the land?  No.  Is it a very good dog that I would come back to often if I lived in Berkeley?  Yes!  I was glad I stopped!"

393,"My buddy who went to Cal, told me that I needed to go here.  I love hot dogs, so it was right up my alley.  We were headed over to Zachary's, but made a pit stop here to grab a dog. First of all, this place is tiny!  One man operation.  I walked in, ordered 2 Top Dogs, dressed them up, and was on my way.  Here is what I thought about the dog................Top Dog-  When you order your dog, they pull your encased meats from the pile of sausages cooking over to the right.  They throw your dog on the ""hot side"" of the grill and cook it, slap it between a bun (which is also toasted on the griddle) and then you are in charge of your own toppings.  I went basic with just mustard and onions.  I went mustard, onions and relish for my mom and brothers dog (they split one).  What did I think?  It was pretty darn good!  They use a natural casing dog, so you get the ""snap"".  The dogs are pretty long, and hang out both ends of the bun. About that one........They actually use a little loaf of seeded bread.  Surprisingly it works really well!  The bun to dog ratio is just a bit off, but it's still a mighty fine hot dog, regardless.  I ate my dog in the car, and we were on our way.I could definitely see how my buddy loved this place.  Is it replacing Ted's or Wieners Circle as my best/favorite hot dog in the land?  No.  Is it a very good dog that I would come back to often if I lived in Berkeley?  Yes!  I was glad I stopped!"

396,"Great for a late night snack. Visited here on the way back after a recommendation from a friend.  I had the German Frankfurter and it was delicious!

I think for me it was more of the sides and roll that made the hot dog delicious.Location: We came around 9-10pm on a Friday night and it was easy to find parking.

473,"My buddy who went to Cal, told me that I needed to go here.  I love hot dogs, so it was right up my alley.  We were headed over to Zachary's, but made a pit stop here to grab a dog. First of all, this place is tiny!  One man operation.  I walked in, ordered 2 Top Dogs, dressed them up, and was on my way.  Here is what I thought about the dog................Top Dog-  When you order your dog, they pull your encased meats from the pile of sausages cooking over to the right.  They throw your dog on the ""hot side"" of the grill and cook it, slap it between a bun (which is also toasted on the griddle) and then you are in charge of your own toppings.  I went basic with just mustard and onions.  I went mustard, onions and relish for my mom and brothers dog (they split one).  What did I think?  It was pretty darn good!  They use a natural casing dog, so you get the ""snap"".  The dogs are pretty long, and hang out both ends of the bun. About that one........They actually use a little loaf of seeded bread.  Surprisingly it works really well!  The bun to dog ratio is just a bit off, but it's still a mighty fine hot dog, regardless.  I ate my dog in the car, and we were on our way.I could definitely see how my buddy loved this place.  Is it replacing Ted's or Wieners Circle as my best/favorite hot dog in the land?  No.  Is it a very good dog that I would come back to often if I lived in Berkeley?  Yes!  I was glad I stopped!"

553,"My buddy who went to Cal, told me that I needed to go here.  I love hot dogs, so it was right up my alley.  We were headed over to Zachary's, but made a pit stop here to grab a dog. First of all, this place is tiny!  One man operation.  I walked in, ordered 2 Top Dogs, dressed them up, and was on my way.  Here is what I thought about the dog................Top Dog-  When you order your dog, they pull your encased meats from the pile of sausages cooking over to the right.  They throw your dog on the ""hot side"" of the grill and cook it, slap it between a bun (which is also toasted on the griddle) and then you are in charge of your own toppings.  I went basic with just mustard and onions.  I went mustard, onions and relish for my mom and brothers dog (they split one).  What did I think?  It was pretty darn good!  They use a natural casing dog, so you get the ""snap"".  The dogs are pretty long, and hang out both ends of the bun. About that one........They actually use a little loaf of seeded bread.  Surprisingly it works really well!  The bun to dog ratio is just a bit off, but it's still a mighty fine hot dog, regardless.  I ate my dog in the car, and we were on our way.I could definitely see how my buddy loved this place.  Is it replacing Ted's or Wieners Circle as my best/favorite hot dog in the land?  No.  Is it a very good dog that I would come back to often if I lived in Berkeley?  Yes!  I was glad I stopped!"

633,"My buddy who went to Cal, told me that I needed to go here.  I love hot dogs, so it was right up my alley.  We were headed over to Zachary's, but made a pit stop here to grab a dog. First of all, this place is tiny!  One man operation.  I walked in, ordered 2 Top Dogs, dressed them up, and was on my way.  Here is what I thought about the dog................Top Dog-  When you order your dog, they pull your encased meats from the pile of sausages cooking over to the right.  They throw your dog on the ""hot side"" of the grill and cook it, slap it between a bun (which is also toasted on the griddle) and then you are in charge of your own toppings.  I went basic with just mustard and onions.  I went mustard, onions and relish for my mom and brothers dog (they split one).  What did I think?  It was pretty darn good!  They use a natural casing dog, so you get the ""snap"".  The dogs are pretty long, and hang out both ends of the bun. About that one........They actually use a little loaf of seeded bread.  Surprisingly it works really well!  The bun to dog ratio is just a bit off, but it's still a mighty fine hot dog, regardless.  I ate my dog in the car, and we were on our way.I could definitely see how my buddy loved this place.  Is it replacing Ted's or Wieners Circle as my best/favorite hot dog in the land?  No.  Is it a very good dog that I would come back to often if I lived in Berkeley?  Yes!  I was glad I stopped!"

713,"My buddy who went to Cal, told me that I needed to go here.  I love hot dogs, so it was right up my alley.  We were headed over to Zachary's, but made a pit stop here to grab a dog. First of all, this place is tiny!  One man operation.  I walked in, ordered 2 Top Dogs, dressed them up, and was on my way.  Here is what I thought about the dog................Top Dog-  When you order your dog, they pull your encased meats from the pile of sausages cooking over to the right.  They throw your dog on the ""hot side"" of the grill and cook it, slap it between a bun (which is also toasted on the griddle) and then you are in charge of your own toppings.  I went basic with just mustard and onions.  I went mustard, onions and relish for my mom and brothers dog (they split one).  What did I think?  It was pretty darn good!  They use a natural casing dog, so you get the ""snap"".  The dogs are pretty long, and hang out both ends of the bun. About that one........They actually use a little loaf of seeded bread.  Surprisingly it works really well!  The bun to dog ratio is just a bit off, but it's still a mighty fine hot dog, regardless.  I ate my dog in the car, and we were on our way.I could definitely see how my buddy loved this place.  Is it replacing Ted's or Wieners Circle as my best/favorite hot dog in the land?  No.  Is it a very good dog that I would come back to often if I lived in Berkeley?  Yes!  I was glad I stopped!"

About that one........They actually use a little loaf of seeded bread.  Surprisingly it works really well!  The bun to dog ratio is just a bit off, but it's still a mighty fine hot dog, regardless.  I ate my dog in the car, and we were on our way.I could definitely see how my buddy loved this place.  Is it replacing Ted's or Wieners Circle as my best/favorite hot dog in the land?  No.  Is it a very good dog that I would come back to often if I lived in Berkeley?  Yes!  I was glad I stopped!"

About that one........They actually use a little loaf of seeded bread.  Surprisingly it works really well!  The bun to dog ratio is just a bit off, but it's still a mighty fine hot dog, regardless.  I ate my dog in the car, and we were on our way.I could definitely see how my buddy loved this place.  Is it replacing Ted's or Wieners Circle as my best/favorite hot dog in the land?  No.  Is it a very good dog that I would come back to often if I lived in Berkeley?  Yes!  I was glad I stopped!"

933,"My buddy who went to Cal, told me that I needed to go here.  I love hot dogs, so it was right up my alley.  We were headed over to Zachary's, but made a pit stop here to grab a dog. First of all, this place is tiny!  One man operation.  I walked in, ordered 2 Top Dogs, dressed them up, and was on my way.  Here is what I thought about the dog................Top Dog-  When you order your dog, they pull your encased meats from the pile of sausages cooking over to the right.  They throw your dog on the ""hot side"" of the grill and cook it, slap it between a bun (which is also toasted on the griddle) and then you are in charge of your own toppings.  I went basic with just mustard and onions.  I went mustard, onions and relish for my mom and brothers dog (they split one).  What did I think?  It was pretty darn good!  They use a natural casing dog, so you get the ""snap"".  The dogs are pretty long, and hang out both ends of the bun. About that one........They actually use a little loaf of seeded bread.  Surprisingly it works really well!  The bun to dog ratio is just a bit off, but it's still a mighty fine hot dog, regardless.  I ate my dog in the car, and we were on our way.I could definitely see how my buddy loved this place.  Is it replacing Ted's or Wieners Circle as my best/favorite hot dog in the land?  No.  Is it a very good dog that I would come back to often if I lived in Berkeley?  Yes!  I was glad I stopped!"

936,"Great for a late night snack. Visited here on the way back after a recommendation from a friend.  I had the German Frankfurter and it was delicious!

First of all, this place is tiny!  One man operation.  I walked in, ordered 2 Top Dogs, dressed them up, and was on my way.  Here is what I thought about the dog................Top Dog-  When you order your dog, they pull your encased meats from the pile of sausages cooking over to the right.  They throw your dog on the ""hot side"" of the grill and cook it, slap it between a bun (which is also toasted on the griddle) and then you are in charge of your own toppings.  I went basic with just mustard and onions.  I went mustard, onions and relish for my mom and brothers dog (they split one).  What did I think?  It was pretty darn good!  They use a natural casing dog, so you get the ""snap"".  The dogs are pretty long, and hang out both ends of the bun. About that one........They actually use a little loaf of seeded bread.  Surprisingly it works really well!  The bun to dog ratio is just a bit off, but it's still a mighty fine hot dog, regardless.  I ate my dog in the car, and we were on our way.I could definitely see how my buddy loved this place.  Is it replacing Ted's or Wieners Circle as my best/favorite hot dog in the land?  No.  Is it a very good dog that I would come back to often if I lived in Berkeley?  Yes!  I was glad I stopped!"

About that one........They actually use a little loaf of seeded bread.  Surprisingly it works really well!  The bun to dog ratio is just a bit off, but it's still a mighty fine hot dog, regardless.  I ate my dog in the car, and we were on our way.I could definitely see how my buddy loved this place.  Is it replacing Ted's or Wieners Circle as my best/favorite hot dog in the land?  No.  Is it a very good dog that I would come back to often if I lived in Berkeley?  Yes!  I was glad I stopped!"

About that one........They actually use a little loaf of seeded bread.  Surprisingly it works really well!  The bun to dog ratio is just a bit off, but it's still a mighty fine hot dog, regardless.  I ate my dog in the car, and we were on our way.I could definitely see how my buddy loved this place.  Is it replacing Ted's or Wieners Circle as my best/favorite hot dog in the land?  No.  Is it a very good dog that I would come back to often if I lived in Berkeley?  Yes!  I was glad I stopped!"

About that one........They actually use a little loaf of seeded bread.  Surprisingly it works really well!  The bun to dog ratio is just a bit off, but it's still a mighty fine hot dog, regardless.  I ate my dog in the car, and we were on our way.I could definitely see how my buddy loved this place.  Is it replacing Ted's or Wieners Circle as my best/favorite hot dog in the land?  No.  Is it a very good dog that I would come back to often if I lived in Berkeley?  Yes!  I was glad I stopped!"

About that one........They actually use a little loaf of seeded bread.  Surprisingly it works really well!  The bun to dog ratio is just a bit off, but it's still a mighty fine hot dog, regardless.  I ate my dog in the car, and we were on our way.I could definitely see how my buddy loved this place.  Is it replacing Ted's or Wieners Circle as my best/favorite hot dog in the land?  No.  Is it a very good dog that I would come back to often if I lived in Berkeley?  Yes!  I was glad I stopped!"

About that one........They actually use a little loaf of seeded bread.  Surprisingly it works really well!  The bun to dog ratio is just a bit off, but it's still a mighty fine hot dog, regardless.  I ate my dog in the car, and we were on our way.I could definitely see how my buddy loved this place.  Is it replacing Ted's or Wieners Circle as my best/favorite hot dog in the land?  No.  Is it a very good dog that I would come back to often if I lived in Berkeley?  Yes!  I was glad I stopped!"

First of all, this place is tiny!  One man operation.  I walked in, ordered 2 Top Dogs, dressed them up, and was on my way.  Here is what I thought about the dog................Top Dog-  When you order your dog, they pull your encased meats from the pile of sausages cooking over to the right.  They throw your dog on the ""hot side"" of the grill and cook it, slap it between a bun (which is also toasted on the griddle) and then you are in charge of your own toppings.  I went basic with just mustard and onions.  I went mustard, onions and relish for my mom and brothers dog (they split one).  What did I think?  It was pretty darn good!  They use a natural casing dog, so you get the ""snap"".  The dogs are pretty long, and hang out both ends of the bun. About that one........They actually use a little loaf of seeded bread.  Surprisingly it works really well!  The bun to dog ratio is just a bit off, but it's still a mighty fine hot dog, regardless.  I ate my dog in the car, and we were on our way.I could definitely see how my buddy loved this place.  Is it replacing Ted's or Wieners Circle as my best/favorite hot dog in the land?  No.  Is it a very good dog that I would come back to often if I lived in Berkeley?  Yes!  I was glad I stopped!"
