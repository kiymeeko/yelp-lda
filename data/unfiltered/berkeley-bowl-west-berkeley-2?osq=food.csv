0,"Came here on Thursday for the first time, loved it so much I only shopped half the store and left. Brought my girlfriend with me on Friday so we could enjoy this experience together. This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
1,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!
2,"I wish Yelp let you review different aspects of a business, because when it comes to selection and variety, this place is five stars! They have all manner of ingredients, food, and produce. It's a wonderful place to go if you're vegetarian or vegan! Just excellent.But their staff? They must beat them during their breaks or pay them $2 an hour, or perhaps they hire people who affirm their intention of being incredibly rude. A few examples:A cashier rung me up and then just stood there and stared at me. Didn't help me bag my groceries or even offer.Another cashier left her post as I walked up to go outside and pet a small dog who was tied up outside. She left me waiting there at her reigster to pet an animal, and then came back and  handled food I was buying without washing or even sanitizing her hands.Sitting in the cafe', a Berkely Bowl employee sat down at my table, picking his teeth and spacing out. He didn't ask if he could sit there or even if the seat was free, and the place was more than half empty. He could have easily sat at another table.I showed up early on a Sunday, not realizing the store was  not going to open for at least another half an hour. When an empoyee informed me of this, several of the employees setting up the store started laughing at me.And these are just a few examples. I could give many more.Five stars for selection. Zero stars for service. Seriously, if I could give zero stars for their employees I would.I also have some more opinions on the people who work there, but I don't use that kind of language in mixed company."
3,"Date: 6/3/2017  Time: 11:25 AM  63°  Partly sunnyMy first time coming into this store and my reaction?!? Wow...supercalifragilisticexpialidosis!!! I just hope that I spelled the word correct. It is huge...bigly. So big, that it has a cafe across from the store serving breakfast and lunch items. The cafe also has a coffee bar...nice. Definitely I will have to come back to shop and have lunch.I was amazed at what Berkeley Bowl West had to offer  - wide range of fruits and vegetables; assortment of breads, rolls, baguettes; mouth watering baked goods(cakes, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, fruit tarts); deli meats and cheese for sandwiches; floral section; meat and seafood - all at reasonable prices. They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while. The purpose of my visit was to attend the Stonewall Kitchen Jam Tour. They were supposed to be there doing a demo of their products at 12 noon. Instead the lady at the info desk told me it was scheduled for 1PM. Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking. Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."
4,"Just arrived to buy organic semolina pasta, organic mushrooms, and organic beef tenderloin. Aim on cooking stroganov in an hour for Russian night!I'm so tired today... wonder why"
5,"If crowds or parking put you off, come here on a Friday night. You'll practically have the place to yourself. I'm something of a grocery store connoisseur. I love browsing the aisles of food shops wherever I can find them. And when I travel, I almost always bring back edible souvenirs. Visiting Berkeley Bowl West is sort of like going on an exotic trip with the many amazing products they carry. The bulk offerings are truly remarkable. You can find everything from spiced rooibos chai, dried organic persimmons and hibiscus flowers to azuki beans, roasted buckwheat groats and garbanzo flour.My personal favorites are the honey roasted sesame sticks, genmaicha tea and dark chocolate chipotle almonds. I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
6,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."
7,Omg this is a paradise for produceIf your in Berkley it's worth a trip. Just to give you an idea of variety they have 12 varieties of pineapples.
8,"The vast selection of produce at Berkeley Bowl makes it a must stop whenever in the area. I'm always blown away by the mushrooms, local in-season produce, organics and the bargain bins. Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
9,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
10,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
11,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."
12,"This is my absolute favorite Berkeley Bowl! It's such a massive place and with so much produce, how can you go wrong. So much selection to chose from.  Everything in season is always a great pick. Great location as well. ... After the Oregon Berkeley Bowl. Correction, this is my second favorite Berkeley Bowl since I go to the other one more often!"
13,"Overall Berkeley Bowl West is perhaps slightly smaller than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. The bulk section might be slightly smaller here yet the produce section is perhaps bigger than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. Great place to stock up on bulk, produce, & everything else you might need even some products you never knew existed. The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."
14,"Everything you could ever need in the history of ever in the convenience of one giant store. Looking for homeopathic body products? Got it. Just need some Advil? Got it. I love that they have regular grocery store items but also have organic, natural products as well. Amazing!!"
15,"Do you want a S, M, L, or XL avocado today? Do you want strawberries from this farm or that farm? Are you looking for that uncommon produce that will go perfectly with your meal this week? Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal! Don't forget to grab a free cheese sample on your way in/out!"
16,"Berkeley Bowl West is great. This is a big, independent, and popular grocery store located in Southwest Berkeley. The organic produce section is huge and you can buy several foods in bulk. There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics. We got a loaf of bread, rolls, English muffins, blueberry muffins, sliced cantaloupe (1/2), sugar, sour cream, and other cooking ingredients, cartons of organic juice (apple and orange), Berkeley Farms eggnog, ice cream, assorted day-old pastries, and a spectacular fruit tart which we took to a dinner party for dessert. It was a hit.Berkeley Bowl has a nice selection of discounted day-old items from the bakery along with old produce that's still good to eat. It's the biggest I've seen of any grocery store. It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."
17,"Love this place, there is a large variety of healthy fruits, meats, grains, nuts, and most importantly veggies. Priced very fairly and a lot of their groceries are either locally farmed for made. Finally a health food store where packaged food and bottled food products occupy less than half of the space. This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
18,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
19,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"

She left me waiting there at her reigster to pet an animal, and then came back and  handled food I was buying without washing or even sanitizing her hands.Sitting in the cafe', a Berkely Bowl employee sat down at my table, picking his teeth and spacing out. He didn't ask if he could sit there or even if the seat was free, and the place was more than half empty. He could have easily sat at another table.I showed up early on a Sunday, not realizing the store was  not going to open for at least another half an hour. When an empoyee informed me of this, several of the employees setting up the store started laughing at me.And these are just a few examples. I could give many more.Five stars for selection. Zero stars for service. Seriously, if I could give zero stars for their employees I would.I also have some more opinions on the people who work there, but I don't use that kind of language in mixed company."
43,"Date: 6/3/2017  Time: 11:25 AM  63°  Partly sunnyMy first time coming into this store and my reaction?!? Wow...supercalifragilisticexpialidosis!!! I just hope that I spelled the word correct. It is huge...bigly. So big, that it has a cafe across from the store serving breakfast and lunch items. The cafe also has a coffee bar...nice. Definitely I will have to come back to shop and have lunch.I was amazed at what Berkeley Bowl West had to offer  - wide range of fruits and vegetables; assortment of breads, rolls, baguettes; mouth watering baked goods(cakes, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, fruit tarts); deli meats and cheese for sandwiches; floral section; meat and seafood - all at reasonable prices. They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while. The purpose of my visit was to attend the Stonewall Kitchen Jam Tour. They were supposed to be there doing a demo of their products at 12 noon. Instead the lady at the info desk told me it was scheduled for 1PM. Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking. Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."
44,"Just arrived to buy organic semolina pasta, organic mushrooms, and organic beef tenderloin. Aim on cooking stroganov in an hour for Russian night!I'm so tired today... wonder why"
45,"If crowds or parking put you off, come here on a Friday night. You'll practically have the place to yourself. I'm something of a grocery store connoisseur. I love browsing the aisles of food shops wherever I can find them. And when I travel, I almost always bring back edible souvenirs. Visiting Berkeley Bowl West is sort of like going on an exotic trip with the many amazing products they carry. The bulk offerings are truly remarkable. You can find everything from spiced rooibos chai, dried organic persimmons and hibiscus flowers to azuki beans, roasted buckwheat groats and garbanzo flour.My personal favorites are the honey roasted sesame sticks, genmaicha tea and dark chocolate chipotle almonds. I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
46,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."
47,Omg this is a paradise for produceIf your in Berkley it's worth a trip. Just to give you an idea of variety they have 12 varieties of pineapples.
48,"The vast selection of produce at Berkeley Bowl makes it a must stop whenever in the area. I'm always blown away by the mushrooms, local in-season produce, organics and the bargain bins. Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
49,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
50,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
51,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."
52,"This is my absolute favorite Berkeley Bowl! It's such a massive place and with so much produce, how can you go wrong. So much selection to chose from.  Everything in season is always a great pick. Great location as well. ... After the Oregon Berkeley Bowl. Correction, this is my second favorite Berkeley Bowl since I go to the other one more often!"
53,"Overall Berkeley Bowl West is perhaps slightly smaller than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. The bulk section might be slightly smaller here yet the produce section is perhaps bigger than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. Great place to stock up on bulk, produce, & everything else you might need even some products you never knew existed. The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."
54,"Everything you could ever need in the history of ever in the convenience of one giant store. Looking for homeopathic body products? Got it. Just need some Advil? Got it. I love that they have regular grocery store items but also have organic, natural products as well. Amazing!!"
55,"Do you want a S, M, L, or XL avocado today? Do you want strawberries from this farm or that farm? Are you looking for that uncommon produce that will go perfectly with your meal this week? Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal! Don't forget to grab a free cheese sample on your way in/out!"
56,"Berkeley Bowl West is great. This is a big, independent, and popular grocery store located in Southwest Berkeley. The organic produce section is huge and you can buy several foods in bulk. There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics. We got a loaf of bread, rolls, English muffins, blueberry muffins, sliced cantaloupe (1/2), sugar, sour cream, and other cooking ingredients, cartons of organic juice (apple and orange), Berkeley Farms eggnog, ice cream, assorted day-old pastries, and a spectacular fruit tart which we took to a dinner party for dessert. It was a hit.Berkeley Bowl has a nice selection of discounted day-old items from the bakery along with old produce that's still good to eat. It's the biggest I've seen of any grocery store. It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."
57,"Love this place, there is a large variety of healthy fruits, meats, grains, nuts, and most importantly veggies. Priced very fairly and a lot of their groceries are either locally farmed for made. Finally a health food store where packaged food and bottled food products occupy less than half of the space. This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
58,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
59,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"
60,"Came here on Thursday for the first time, loved it so much I only shopped half the store and left. Brought my girlfriend with me on Friday so we could enjoy this experience together. This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
61,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!
62,"I wish Yelp let you review different aspects of a business, because when it comes to selection and variety, this place is five stars! They have all manner of ingredients, food, and produce. It's a wonderful place to go if you're vegetarian or vegan! Just excellent.But their staff? They must beat them during their breaks or pay them $2 an hour, or perhaps they hire people who affirm their intention of being incredibly rude.

They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while. The purpose of my visit was to attend the Stonewall Kitchen Jam Tour. They were supposed to be there doing a demo of their products at 12 noon. Instead the lady at the info desk told me it was scheduled for 1PM. Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking. Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."
84,"Just arrived to buy organic semolina pasta, organic mushrooms, and organic beef tenderloin. Aim on cooking stroganov in an hour for Russian night!I'm so tired today... wonder why"
85,"If crowds or parking put you off, come here on a Friday night. You'll practically have the place to yourself. I'm something of a grocery store connoisseur. I love browsing the aisles of food shops wherever I can find them. And when I travel, I almost always bring back edible souvenirs. Visiting Berkeley Bowl West is sort of like going on an exotic trip with the many amazing products they carry. The bulk offerings are truly remarkable. You can find everything from spiced rooibos chai, dried organic persimmons and hibiscus flowers to azuki beans, roasted buckwheat groats and garbanzo flour.My personal favorites are the honey roasted sesame sticks, genmaicha tea and dark chocolate chipotle almonds. I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
86,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."
87,Omg this is a paradise for produceIf your in Berkley it's worth a trip. Just to give you an idea of variety they have 12 varieties of pineapples.
88,"The vast selection of produce at Berkeley Bowl makes it a must stop whenever in the area. I'm always blown away by the mushrooms, local in-season produce, organics and the bargain bins. Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
89,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
90,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
91,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."
92,"This is my absolute favorite Berkeley Bowl! It's such a massive place and with so much produce, how can you go wrong. So much selection to chose from.  Everything in season is always a great pick. Great location as well. ... After the Oregon Berkeley Bowl. Correction, this is my second favorite Berkeley Bowl since I go to the other one more often!"
93,"Overall Berkeley Bowl West is perhaps slightly smaller than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. The bulk section might be slightly smaller here yet the produce section is perhaps bigger than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. Great place to stock up on bulk, produce, & everything else you might need even some products you never knew existed. The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."
94,"Everything you could ever need in the history of ever in the convenience of one giant store. Looking for homeopathic body products? Got it. Just need some Advil? Got it. I love that they have regular grocery store items but also have organic, natural products as well. Amazing!!"
95,"Do you want a S, M, L, or XL avocado today? Do you want strawberries from this farm or that farm? Are you looking for that uncommon produce that will go perfectly with your meal this week? Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal! Don't forget to grab a free cheese sample on your way in/out!"
96,"Berkeley Bowl West is great. This is a big, independent, and popular grocery store located in Southwest Berkeley. The organic produce section is huge and you can buy several foods in bulk. There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics. We got a loaf of bread, rolls, English muffins, blueberry muffins, sliced cantaloupe (1/2), sugar, sour cream, and other cooking ingredients, cartons of organic juice (apple and orange), Berkeley Farms eggnog, ice cream, assorted day-old pastries, and a spectacular fruit tart which we took to a dinner party for dessert. It was a hit.Berkeley Bowl has a nice selection of discounted day-old items from the bakery along with old produce that's still good to eat. It's the biggest I've seen of any grocery store. It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."
97,"Love this place, there is a large variety of healthy fruits, meats, grains, nuts, and most importantly veggies. Priced very fairly and a lot of their groceries are either locally farmed for made. Finally a health food store where packaged food and bottled food products occupy less than half of the space. This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
98,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
99,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"
100,"Came here on Thursday for the first time, loved it so much I only shopped half the store and left. Brought my girlfriend with me on Friday so we could enjoy this experience together. This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
101,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!
102,"I wish Yelp let you review different aspects of a business, because when it comes to selection and variety, this place is five stars! They have all manner of ingredients, food, and produce. It's a wonderful place to go if you're vegetarian or vegan! Just excellent.But their staff? They must beat them during their breaks or pay them $2 an hour, or perhaps they hire people who affirm their intention of being incredibly rude. A few examples:A cashier rung me up and then just stood there and stared at me. Didn't help me bag my groceries or even offer.Another cashier left her post as I walked up to go outside and pet a small dog who was tied up outside. She left me waiting there at her reigster to pet an animal, and then came back and  handled food I was buying without washing or even sanitizing her hands.Sitting in the cafe', a Berkely Bowl employee sat down at my table, picking his teeth and spacing out. He didn't ask if he could sit there or even if the seat was free, and the place was more than half empty. He could have easily sat at another table.I showed up early on a Sunday, not realizing the store was  not going to open for at least another half an hour. When an empoyee informed me of this, several of the employees setting up the store started laughing at me.And these are just a few examples. I could give many more.Five stars for selection. Zero stars for service. Seriously, if I could give zero stars for their employees I would.I also have some more opinions on the people who work there, but I don't use that kind of language in mixed company."

124,"Just arrived to buy organic semolina pasta, organic mushrooms, and organic beef tenderloin. Aim on cooking stroganov in an hour for Russian night!I'm so tired today... wonder why"
125,"If crowds or parking put you off, come here on a Friday night. You'll practically have the place to yourself. I'm something of a grocery store connoisseur. I love browsing the aisles of food shops wherever I can find them. And when I travel, I almost always bring back edible souvenirs. Visiting Berkeley Bowl West is sort of like going on an exotic trip with the many amazing products they carry. The bulk offerings are truly remarkable. You can find everything from spiced rooibos chai, dried organic persimmons and hibiscus flowers to azuki beans, roasted buckwheat groats and garbanzo flour.My personal favorites are the honey roasted sesame sticks, genmaicha tea and dark chocolate chipotle almonds. I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
126,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."
127,Omg this is a paradise for produceIf your in Berkley it's worth a trip. Just to give you an idea of variety they have 12 varieties of pineapples.
128,"The vast selection of produce at Berkeley Bowl makes it a must stop whenever in the area. I'm always blown away by the mushrooms, local in-season produce, organics and the bargain bins. Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
129,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
130,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
131,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."
132,"This is my absolute favorite Berkeley Bowl! It's such a massive place and with so much produce, how can you go wrong. So much selection to chose from.  Everything in season is always a great pick. Great location as well. ... After the Oregon Berkeley Bowl. Correction, this is my second favorite Berkeley Bowl since I go to the other one more often!"
133,"Overall Berkeley Bowl West is perhaps slightly smaller than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. The bulk section might be slightly smaller here yet the produce section is perhaps bigger than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. Great place to stock up on bulk, produce, & everything else you might need even some products you never knew existed. The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."
134,"Everything you could ever need in the history of ever in the convenience of one giant store. Looking for homeopathic body products? Got it. Just need some Advil? Got it. I love that they have regular grocery store items but also have organic, natural products as well. Amazing!!"
135,"Do you want a S, M, L, or XL avocado today? Do you want strawberries from this farm or that farm? Are you looking for that uncommon produce that will go perfectly with your meal this week? Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal! Don't forget to grab a free cheese sample on your way in/out!"
136,"Berkeley Bowl West is great. This is a big, independent, and popular grocery store located in Southwest Berkeley. The organic produce section is huge and you can buy several foods in bulk. There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics. We got a loaf of bread, rolls, English muffins, blueberry muffins, sliced cantaloupe (1/2), sugar, sour cream, and other cooking ingredients, cartons of organic juice (apple and orange), Berkeley Farms eggnog, ice cream, assorted day-old pastries, and a spectacular fruit tart which we took to a dinner party for dessert. It was a hit.Berkeley Bowl has a nice selection of discounted day-old items from the bakery along with old produce that's still good to eat. It's the biggest I've seen of any grocery store. It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."
137,"Love this place, there is a large variety of healthy fruits, meats, grains, nuts, and most importantly veggies. Priced very fairly and a lot of their groceries are either locally farmed for made. Finally a health food store where packaged food and bottled food products occupy less than half of the space. This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
138,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
139,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"
140,"Came here on Thursday for the first time, loved it so much I only shopped half the store and left. Brought my girlfriend with me on Friday so we could enjoy this experience together. This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
141,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!
142,"I wish Yelp let you review different aspects of a business, because when it comes to selection and variety, this place is five stars! They have all manner of ingredients, food, and produce. It's a wonderful place to go if you're vegetarian or vegan! Just excellent.But their staff? They must beat them during their breaks or pay them $2 an hour, or perhaps they hire people who affirm their intention of being incredibly rude. A few examples:A cashier rung me up and then just stood there and stared at me. Didn't help me bag my groceries or even offer.Another cashier left her post as I walked up to go outside and pet a small dog who was tied up outside. She left me waiting there at her reigster to pet an animal, and then came back and  handled food I was buying without washing or even sanitizing her hands.Sitting in the cafe', a Berkely Bowl employee sat down at my table, picking his teeth and spacing out. He didn't ask if he could sit there or even if the seat was free, and the place was more than half empty. He could have easily sat at another table.I showed up early on a Sunday, not realizing the store was  not going to open for at least another half an hour. When an empoyee informed me of this, several of the employees setting up the store started laughing at me.And these are just a few examples. I could give many more.Five stars for selection. Zero stars for service. Seriously, if I could give zero stars for their employees I would.I also have some more opinions on the people who work there, but I don't use that kind of language in mixed company."
143,"Date: 6/3/2017  Time: 11:25 AM  63°  Partly sunnyMy first time coming into this store and my reaction?!? Wow...supercalifragilisticexpialidosis!!! I just hope that I spelled the word correct. It is huge...bigly. So big, that it has a cafe across from the store serving breakfast and lunch items. The cafe also has a coffee bar...nice. Definitely I will have to come back to shop and have lunch.I was amazed at what Berkeley Bowl West had to offer  - wide range of fruits and vegetables; assortment of breads, rolls, baguettes; mouth watering baked goods(cakes, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, fruit tarts); deli meats and cheese for sandwiches; floral section; meat and seafood - all at reasonable prices. They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while. The purpose of my visit was to attend the Stonewall Kitchen Jam Tour. They were supposed to be there doing a demo of their products at 12 noon. Instead the lady at the info desk told me it was scheduled for 1PM. Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking.

166,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."
167,Omg this is a paradise for produceIf your in Berkley it's worth a trip. Just to give you an idea of variety they have 12 varieties of pineapples.
168,"The vast selection of produce at Berkeley Bowl makes it a must stop whenever in the area. I'm always blown away by the mushrooms, local in-season produce, organics and the bargain bins. Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
169,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
170,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
171,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."
172,"This is my absolute favorite Berkeley Bowl! It's such a massive place and with so much produce, how can you go wrong. So much selection to chose from.  Everything in season is always a great pick. Great location as well. ... After the Oregon Berkeley Bowl. Correction, this is my second favorite Berkeley Bowl since I go to the other one more often!"
173,"Overall Berkeley Bowl West is perhaps slightly smaller than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. The bulk section might be slightly smaller here yet the produce section is perhaps bigger than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. Great place to stock up on bulk, produce, & everything else you might need even some products you never knew existed. The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."
174,"Everything you could ever need in the history of ever in the convenience of one giant store. Looking for homeopathic body products? Got it. Just need some Advil? Got it. I love that they have regular grocery store items but also have organic, natural products as well. Amazing!!"
175,"Do you want a S, M, L, or XL avocado today? Do you want strawberries from this farm or that farm? Are you looking for that uncommon produce that will go perfectly with your meal this week? Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal! Don't forget to grab a free cheese sample on your way in/out!"
176,"Berkeley Bowl West is great. This is a big, independent, and popular grocery store located in Southwest Berkeley. The organic produce section is huge and you can buy several foods in bulk. There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics. We got a loaf of bread, rolls, English muffins, blueberry muffins, sliced cantaloupe (1/2), sugar, sour cream, and other cooking ingredients, cartons of organic juice (apple and orange), Berkeley Farms eggnog, ice cream, assorted day-old pastries, and a spectacular fruit tart which we took to a dinner party for dessert. It was a hit.Berkeley Bowl has a nice selection of discounted day-old items from the bakery along with old produce that's still good to eat. It's the biggest I've seen of any grocery store. It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."
177,"Love this place, there is a large variety of healthy fruits, meats, grains, nuts, and most importantly veggies. Priced very fairly and a lot of their groceries are either locally farmed for made. Finally a health food store where packaged food and bottled food products occupy less than half of the space. This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
178,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
179,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"
180,"Came here on Thursday for the first time, loved it so much I only shopped half the store and left. Brought my girlfriend with me on Friday so we could enjoy this experience together. This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
181,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!
182,"I wish Yelp let you review different aspects of a business, because when it comes to selection and variety, this place is five stars! They have all manner of ingredients, food, and produce. It's a wonderful place to go if you're vegetarian or vegan! Just excellent.But their staff? They must beat them during their breaks or pay them $2 an hour, or perhaps they hire people who affirm their intention of being incredibly rude. A few examples:A cashier rung me up and then just stood there and stared at me. Didn't help me bag my groceries or even offer.Another cashier left her post as I walked up to go outside and pet a small dog who was tied up outside. She left me waiting there at her reigster to pet an animal, and then came back and  handled food I was buying without washing or even sanitizing her hands.Sitting in the cafe', a Berkely Bowl employee sat down at my table, picking his teeth and spacing out. He didn't ask if he could sit there or even if the seat was free, and the place was more than half empty. He could have easily sat at another table.I showed up early on a Sunday, not realizing the store was  not going to open for at least another half an hour. When an empoyee informed me of this, several of the employees setting up the store started laughing at me.And these are just a few examples. I could give many more.Five stars for selection. Zero stars for service. Seriously, if I could give zero stars for their employees I would.I also have some more opinions on the people who work there, but I don't use that kind of language in mixed company."
183,"Date: 6/3/2017  Time: 11:25 AM  63°  Partly sunnyMy first time coming into this store and my reaction?!? Wow...supercalifragilisticexpialidosis!!! I just hope that I spelled the word correct. It is huge...bigly. So big, that it has a cafe across from the store serving breakfast and lunch items. The cafe also has a coffee bar...nice. Definitely I will have to come back to shop and have lunch.I was amazed at what Berkeley Bowl West had to offer  - wide range of fruits and vegetables; assortment of breads, rolls, baguettes; mouth watering baked goods(cakes, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, fruit tarts); deli meats and cheese for sandwiches; floral section; meat and seafood - all at reasonable prices. They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while. The purpose of my visit was to attend the Stonewall Kitchen Jam Tour. They were supposed to be there doing a demo of their products at 12 noon. Instead the lady at the info desk told me it was scheduled for 1PM. Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking. Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."

209,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
210,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
211,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."
212,"This is my absolute favorite Berkeley Bowl! It's such a massive place and with so much produce, how can you go wrong. So much selection to chose from.  Everything in season is always a great pick. Great location as well. ... After the Oregon Berkeley Bowl. Correction, this is my second favorite Berkeley Bowl since I go to the other one more often!"
213,"Overall Berkeley Bowl West is perhaps slightly smaller than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. The bulk section might be slightly smaller here yet the produce section is perhaps bigger than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. Great place to stock up on bulk, produce, & everything else you might need even some products you never knew existed. The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."
214,"Everything you could ever need in the history of ever in the convenience of one giant store. Looking for homeopathic body products? Got it. Just need some Advil? Got it. I love that they have regular grocery store items but also have organic, natural products as well. Amazing!!"
215,"Do you want a S, M, L, or XL avocado today? Do you want strawberries from this farm or that farm? Are you looking for that uncommon produce that will go perfectly with your meal this week? Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal! Don't forget to grab a free cheese sample on your way in/out!"
216,"Berkeley Bowl West is great. This is a big, independent, and popular grocery store located in Southwest Berkeley. The organic produce section is huge and you can buy several foods in bulk. There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics. We got a loaf of bread, rolls, English muffins, blueberry muffins, sliced cantaloupe (1/2), sugar, sour cream, and other cooking ingredients, cartons of organic juice (apple and orange), Berkeley Farms eggnog, ice cream, assorted day-old pastries, and a spectacular fruit tart which we took to a dinner party for dessert. It was a hit.Berkeley Bowl has a nice selection of discounted day-old items from the bakery along with old produce that's still good to eat. It's the biggest I've seen of any grocery store. It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."
217,"Love this place, there is a large variety of healthy fruits, meats, grains, nuts, and most importantly veggies. Priced very fairly and a lot of their groceries are either locally farmed for made. Finally a health food store where packaged food and bottled food products occupy less than half of the space. This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
218,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
219,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"
220,"Came here on Thursday for the first time, loved it so much I only shopped half the store and left. Brought my girlfriend with me on Friday so we could enjoy this experience together. This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
221,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!
222,"I wish Yelp let you review different aspects of a business, because when it comes to selection and variety, this place is five stars! They have all manner of ingredients, food, and produce. It's a wonderful place to go if you're vegetarian or vegan! Just excellent.But their staff? They must beat them during their breaks or pay them $2 an hour, or perhaps they hire people who affirm their intention of being incredibly rude. A few examples:A cashier rung me up and then just stood there and stared at me. Didn't help me bag my groceries or even offer.Another cashier left her post as I walked up to go outside and pet a small dog who was tied up outside. She left me waiting there at her reigster to pet an animal, and then came back and  handled food I was buying without washing or even sanitizing her hands.Sitting in the cafe', a Berkely Bowl employee sat down at my table, picking his teeth and spacing out. He didn't ask if he could sit there or even if the seat was free, and the place was more than half empty. He could have easily sat at another table.I showed up early on a Sunday, not realizing the store was  not going to open for at least another half an hour. When an empoyee informed me of this, several of the employees setting up the store started laughing at me.And these are just a few examples. I could give many more.Five stars for selection. Zero stars for service. Seriously, if I could give zero stars for their employees I would.I also have some more opinions on the people who work there, but I don't use that kind of language in mixed company."
223,"Date: 6/3/2017  Time: 11:25 AM  63°  Partly sunnyMy first time coming into this store and my reaction?!? Wow...supercalifragilisticexpialidosis!!! I just hope that I spelled the word correct. It is huge...bigly. So big, that it has a cafe across from the store serving breakfast and lunch items. The cafe also has a coffee bar...nice. Definitely I will have to come back to shop and have lunch.I was amazed at what Berkeley Bowl West had to offer  - wide range of fruits and vegetables; assortment of breads, rolls, baguettes; mouth watering baked goods(cakes, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, fruit tarts); deli meats and cheese for sandwiches; floral section; meat and seafood - all at reasonable prices. They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while. The purpose of my visit was to attend the Stonewall Kitchen Jam Tour. They were supposed to be there doing a demo of their products at 12 noon. Instead the lady at the info desk told me it was scheduled for 1PM. Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking. Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."
224,"Just arrived to buy organic semolina pasta, organic mushrooms, and organic beef tenderloin. Aim on cooking stroganov in an hour for Russian night!I'm so tired today... wonder why"
225,"If crowds or parking put you off, come here on a Friday night. You'll practically have the place to yourself. I'm something of a grocery store connoisseur. I love browsing the aisles of food shops wherever I can find them. And when I travel, I almost always bring back edible souvenirs. Visiting Berkeley Bowl West is sort of like going on an exotic trip with the many amazing products they carry. The bulk offerings are truly remarkable. You can find everything from spiced rooibos chai, dried organic persimmons and hibiscus flowers to azuki beans, roasted buckwheat groats and garbanzo flour.My personal favorites are the honey roasted sesame sticks, genmaicha tea and dark chocolate chipotle almonds. I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
226,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."

Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."
252,"This is my absolute favorite Berkeley Bowl! It's such a massive place and with so much produce, how can you go wrong. So much selection to chose from.  Everything in season is always a great pick. Great location as well. ... After the Oregon Berkeley Bowl. Correction, this is my second favorite Berkeley Bowl since I go to the other one more often!"
253,"Overall Berkeley Bowl West is perhaps slightly smaller than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. The bulk section might be slightly smaller here yet the produce section is perhaps bigger than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. Great place to stock up on bulk, produce, & everything else you might need even some products you never knew existed. The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."
254,"Everything you could ever need in the history of ever in the convenience of one giant store. Looking for homeopathic body products? Got it. Just need some Advil? Got it. I love that they have regular grocery store items but also have organic, natural products as well. Amazing!!"
255,"Do you want a S, M, L, or XL avocado today? Do you want strawberries from this farm or that farm? Are you looking for that uncommon produce that will go perfectly with your meal this week? Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal! Don't forget to grab a free cheese sample on your way in/out!"
256,"Berkeley Bowl West is great. This is a big, independent, and popular grocery store located in Southwest Berkeley. The organic produce section is huge and you can buy several foods in bulk. There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics. We got a loaf of bread, rolls, English muffins, blueberry muffins, sliced cantaloupe (1/2), sugar, sour cream, and other cooking ingredients, cartons of organic juice (apple and orange), Berkeley Farms eggnog, ice cream, assorted day-old pastries, and a spectacular fruit tart which we took to a dinner party for dessert. It was a hit.Berkeley Bowl has a nice selection of discounted day-old items from the bakery along with old produce that's still good to eat. It's the biggest I've seen of any grocery store. It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."
257,"Love this place, there is a large variety of healthy fruits, meats, grains, nuts, and most importantly veggies. Priced very fairly and a lot of their groceries are either locally farmed for made. Finally a health food store where packaged food and bottled food products occupy less than half of the space. This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
258,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
259,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"
260,"Came here on Thursday for the first time, loved it so much I only shopped half the store and left. Brought my girlfriend with me on Friday so we could enjoy this experience together. This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
261,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!
262,"I wish Yelp let you review different aspects of a business, because when it comes to selection and variety, this place is five stars! They have all manner of ingredients, food, and produce. It's a wonderful place to go if you're vegetarian or vegan! Just excellent.But their staff? They must beat them during their breaks or pay them $2 an hour, or perhaps they hire people who affirm their intention of being incredibly rude. A few examples:A cashier rung me up and then just stood there and stared at me. Didn't help me bag my groceries or even offer.Another cashier left her post as I walked up to go outside and pet a small dog who was tied up outside. She left me waiting there at her reigster to pet an animal, and then came back and  handled food I was buying without washing or even sanitizing her hands.Sitting in the cafe', a Berkely Bowl employee sat down at my table, picking his teeth and spacing out. He didn't ask if he could sit there or even if the seat was free, and the place was more than half empty. He could have easily sat at another table.I showed up early on a Sunday, not realizing the store was  not going to open for at least another half an hour. When an empoyee informed me of this, several of the employees setting up the store started laughing at me.And these are just a few examples. I could give many more.Five stars for selection. Zero stars for service. Seriously, if I could give zero stars for their employees I would.I also have some more opinions on the people who work there, but I don't use that kind of language in mixed company."
263,"Date: 6/3/2017  Time: 11:25 AM  63°  Partly sunnyMy first time coming into this store and my reaction?!? Wow...supercalifragilisticexpialidosis!!! I just hope that I spelled the word correct. It is huge...bigly. So big, that it has a cafe across from the store serving breakfast and lunch items. The cafe also has a coffee bar...nice. Definitely I will have to come back to shop and have lunch.I was amazed at what Berkeley Bowl West had to offer  - wide range of fruits and vegetables; assortment of breads, rolls, baguettes; mouth watering baked goods(cakes, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, fruit tarts); deli meats and cheese for sandwiches; floral section; meat and seafood - all at reasonable prices. They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while. The purpose of my visit was to attend the Stonewall Kitchen Jam Tour. They were supposed to be there doing a demo of their products at 12 noon. Instead the lady at the info desk told me it was scheduled for 1PM. Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking. Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."
264,"Just arrived to buy organic semolina pasta, organic mushrooms, and organic beef tenderloin. Aim on cooking stroganov in an hour for Russian night!I'm so tired today... wonder why"
265,"If crowds or parking put you off, come here on a Friday night. You'll practically have the place to yourself. I'm something of a grocery store connoisseur. I love browsing the aisles of food shops wherever I can find them. And when I travel, I almost always bring back edible souvenirs. Visiting Berkeley Bowl West is sort of like going on an exotic trip with the many amazing products they carry. The bulk offerings are truly remarkable. You can find everything from spiced rooibos chai, dried organic persimmons and hibiscus flowers to azuki beans, roasted buckwheat groats and garbanzo flour.My personal favorites are the honey roasted sesame sticks, genmaicha tea and dark chocolate chipotle almonds. I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
266,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."
267,Omg this is a paradise for produceIf your in Berkley it's worth a trip. Just to give you an idea of variety they have 12 varieties of pineapples.
268,"The vast selection of produce at Berkeley Bowl makes it a must stop whenever in the area. I'm always blown away by the mushrooms, local in-season produce, organics and the bargain bins. Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
269,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
270,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
271,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options.

That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."
294,"Everything you could ever need in the history of ever in the convenience of one giant store. Looking for homeopathic body products? Got it. Just need some Advil? Got it. I love that they have regular grocery store items but also have organic, natural products as well. Amazing!!"
295,"Do you want a S, M, L, or XL avocado today? Do you want strawberries from this farm or that farm? Are you looking for that uncommon produce that will go perfectly with your meal this week? Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal! Don't forget to grab a free cheese sample on your way in/out!"
296,"Berkeley Bowl West is great. This is a big, independent, and popular grocery store located in Southwest Berkeley. The organic produce section is huge and you can buy several foods in bulk. There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics. We got a loaf of bread, rolls, English muffins, blueberry muffins, sliced cantaloupe (1/2), sugar, sour cream, and other cooking ingredients, cartons of organic juice (apple and orange), Berkeley Farms eggnog, ice cream, assorted day-old pastries, and a spectacular fruit tart which we took to a dinner party for dessert. It was a hit.Berkeley Bowl has a nice selection of discounted day-old items from the bakery along with old produce that's still good to eat. It's the biggest I've seen of any grocery store. It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."
297,"Love this place, there is a large variety of healthy fruits, meats, grains, nuts, and most importantly veggies. Priced very fairly and a lot of their groceries are either locally farmed for made. Finally a health food store where packaged food and bottled food products occupy less than half of the space. This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
298,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
299,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"
300,"Came here on Thursday for the first time, loved it so much I only shopped half the store and left. Brought my girlfriend with me on Friday so we could enjoy this experience together. This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
301,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!
302,"I wish Yelp let you review different aspects of a business, because when it comes to selection and variety, this place is five stars! They have all manner of ingredients, food, and produce. It's a wonderful place to go if you're vegetarian or vegan! Just excellent.But their staff? They must beat them during their breaks or pay them $2 an hour, or perhaps they hire people who affirm their intention of being incredibly rude. A few examples:A cashier rung me up and then just stood there and stared at me. Didn't help me bag my groceries or even offer.Another cashier left her post as I walked up to go outside and pet a small dog who was tied up outside. She left me waiting there at her reigster to pet an animal, and then came back and  handled food I was buying without washing or even sanitizing her hands.Sitting in the cafe', a Berkely Bowl employee sat down at my table, picking his teeth and spacing out. He didn't ask if he could sit there or even if the seat was free, and the place was more than half empty. He could have easily sat at another table.I showed up early on a Sunday, not realizing the store was  not going to open for at least another half an hour. When an empoyee informed me of this, several of the employees setting up the store started laughing at me.And these are just a few examples. I could give many more.Five stars for selection. Zero stars for service. Seriously, if I could give zero stars for their employees I would.I also have some more opinions on the people who work there, but I don't use that kind of language in mixed company."
303,"Date: 6/3/2017  Time: 11:25 AM  63°  Partly sunnyMy first time coming into this store and my reaction?!? Wow...supercalifragilisticexpialidosis!!! I just hope that I spelled the word correct. It is huge...bigly. So big, that it has a cafe across from the store serving breakfast and lunch items. The cafe also has a coffee bar...nice. Definitely I will have to come back to shop and have lunch.I was amazed at what Berkeley Bowl West had to offer  - wide range of fruits and vegetables; assortment of breads, rolls, baguettes; mouth watering baked goods(cakes, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, fruit tarts); deli meats and cheese for sandwiches; floral section; meat and seafood - all at reasonable prices. They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while. The purpose of my visit was to attend the Stonewall Kitchen Jam Tour. They were supposed to be there doing a demo of their products at 12 noon. Instead the lady at the info desk told me it was scheduled for 1PM. Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking. Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."
304,"Just arrived to buy organic semolina pasta, organic mushrooms, and organic beef tenderloin. Aim on cooking stroganov in an hour for Russian night!I'm so tired today... wonder why"
305,"If crowds or parking put you off, come here on a Friday night. You'll practically have the place to yourself. I'm something of a grocery store connoisseur. I love browsing the aisles of food shops wherever I can find them. And when I travel, I almost always bring back edible souvenirs. Visiting Berkeley Bowl West is sort of like going on an exotic trip with the many amazing products they carry. The bulk offerings are truly remarkable. You can find everything from spiced rooibos chai, dried organic persimmons and hibiscus flowers to azuki beans, roasted buckwheat groats and garbanzo flour.My personal favorites are the honey roasted sesame sticks, genmaicha tea and dark chocolate chipotle almonds. I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
306,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."
307,Omg this is a paradise for produceIf your in Berkley it's worth a trip. Just to give you an idea of variety they have 12 varieties of pineapples.
308,"The vast selection of produce at Berkeley Bowl makes it a must stop whenever in the area. I'm always blown away by the mushrooms, local in-season produce, organics and the bargain bins. Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
309,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
310,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
311,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."

The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal! Don't forget to grab a free cheese sample on your way in/out!"
336,"Berkeley Bowl West is great. This is a big, independent, and popular grocery store located in Southwest Berkeley. The organic produce section is huge and you can buy several foods in bulk. There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics. We got a loaf of bread, rolls, English muffins, blueberry muffins, sliced cantaloupe (1/2), sugar, sour cream, and other cooking ingredients, cartons of organic juice (apple and orange), Berkeley Farms eggnog, ice cream, assorted day-old pastries, and a spectacular fruit tart which we took to a dinner party for dessert. It was a hit.Berkeley Bowl has a nice selection of discounted day-old items from the bakery along with old produce that's still good to eat. It's the biggest I've seen of any grocery store. It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."
337,"Love this place, there is a large variety of healthy fruits, meats, grains, nuts, and most importantly veggies. Priced very fairly and a lot of their groceries are either locally farmed for made. Finally a health food store where packaged food and bottled food products occupy less than half of the space. This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
338,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
339,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"
340,"Came here on Thursday for the first time, loved it so much I only shopped half the store and left. Brought my girlfriend with me on Friday so we could enjoy this experience together. This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
341,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!
342,"I wish Yelp let you review different aspects of a business, because when it comes to selection and variety, this place is five stars! They have all manner of ingredients, food, and produce. It's a wonderful place to go if you're vegetarian or vegan! Just excellent.But their staff? They must beat them during their breaks or pay them $2 an hour, or perhaps they hire people who affirm their intention of being incredibly rude. A few examples:A cashier rung me up and then just stood there and stared at me. Didn't help me bag my groceries or even offer.Another cashier left her post as I walked up to go outside and pet a small dog who was tied up outside. She left me waiting there at her reigster to pet an animal, and then came back and  handled food I was buying without washing or even sanitizing her hands.Sitting in the cafe', a Berkely Bowl employee sat down at my table, picking his teeth and spacing out. He didn't ask if he could sit there or even if the seat was free, and the place was more than half empty. He could have easily sat at another table.I showed up early on a Sunday, not realizing the store was  not going to open for at least another half an hour. When an empoyee informed me of this, several of the employees setting up the store started laughing at me.And these are just a few examples. I could give many more.Five stars for selection. Zero stars for service. Seriously, if I could give zero stars for their employees I would.I also have some more opinions on the people who work there, but I don't use that kind of language in mixed company."
343,"Date: 6/3/2017  Time: 11:25 AM  63°  Partly sunnyMy first time coming into this store and my reaction?!? Wow...supercalifragilisticexpialidosis!!! I just hope that I spelled the word correct. It is huge...bigly. So big, that it has a cafe across from the store serving breakfast and lunch items. The cafe also has a coffee bar...nice. Definitely I will have to come back to shop and have lunch.I was amazed at what Berkeley Bowl West had to offer  - wide range of fruits and vegetables; assortment of breads, rolls, baguettes; mouth watering baked goods(cakes, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, fruit tarts); deli meats and cheese for sandwiches; floral section; meat and seafood - all at reasonable prices. They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while. The purpose of my visit was to attend the Stonewall Kitchen Jam Tour. They were supposed to be there doing a demo of their products at 12 noon. Instead the lady at the info desk told me it was scheduled for 1PM. Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking. Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."
344,"Just arrived to buy organic semolina pasta, organic mushrooms, and organic beef tenderloin. Aim on cooking stroganov in an hour for Russian night!I'm so tired today... wonder why"
345,"If crowds or parking put you off, come here on a Friday night. You'll practically have the place to yourself. I'm something of a grocery store connoisseur. I love browsing the aisles of food shops wherever I can find them. And when I travel, I almost always bring back edible souvenirs. Visiting Berkeley Bowl West is sort of like going on an exotic trip with the many amazing products they carry. The bulk offerings are truly remarkable. You can find everything from spiced rooibos chai, dried organic persimmons and hibiscus flowers to azuki beans, roasted buckwheat groats and garbanzo flour.My personal favorites are the honey roasted sesame sticks, genmaicha tea and dark chocolate chipotle almonds. I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
346,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."
347,Omg this is a paradise for produceIf your in Berkley it's worth a trip. Just to give you an idea of variety they have 12 varieties of pineapples.
348,"The vast selection of produce at Berkeley Bowl makes it a must stop whenever in the area. I'm always blown away by the mushrooms, local in-season produce, organics and the bargain bins. Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
349,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
350,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
351,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."
352,"This is my absolute favorite Berkeley Bowl! It's such a massive place and with so much produce, how can you go wrong. So much selection to chose from.  Everything in season is always a great pick. Great location as well. ... After the Oregon Berkeley Bowl. Correction, this is my second favorite Berkeley Bowl since I go to the other one more often!"
353,"Overall Berkeley Bowl West is perhaps slightly smaller than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. The bulk section might be slightly smaller here yet the produce section is perhaps bigger than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. Great place to stock up on bulk, produce, & everything else you might need even some products you never knew existed. The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."

They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics. We got a loaf of bread, rolls, English muffins, blueberry muffins, sliced cantaloupe (1/2), sugar, sour cream, and other cooking ingredients, cartons of organic juice (apple and orange), Berkeley Farms eggnog, ice cream, assorted day-old pastries, and a spectacular fruit tart which we took to a dinner party for dessert. It was a hit.Berkeley Bowl has a nice selection of discounted day-old items from the bakery along with old produce that's still good to eat. It's the biggest I've seen of any grocery store. It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."
377,"Love this place, there is a large variety of healthy fruits, meats, grains, nuts, and most importantly veggies. Priced very fairly and a lot of their groceries are either locally farmed for made. Finally a health food store where packaged food and bottled food products occupy less than half of the space. This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
378,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
379,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"
380,"Came here on Thursday for the first time, loved it so much I only shopped half the store and left. Brought my girlfriend with me on Friday so we could enjoy this experience together. This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
381,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!
382,"I wish Yelp let you review different aspects of a business, because when it comes to selection and variety, this place is five stars! They have all manner of ingredients, food, and produce. It's a wonderful place to go if you're vegetarian or vegan! Just excellent.But their staff? They must beat them during their breaks or pay them $2 an hour, or perhaps they hire people who affirm their intention of being incredibly rude. A few examples:A cashier rung me up and then just stood there and stared at me. Didn't help me bag my groceries or even offer.Another cashier left her post as I walked up to go outside and pet a small dog who was tied up outside. She left me waiting there at her reigster to pet an animal, and then came back and  handled food I was buying without washing or even sanitizing her hands.Sitting in the cafe', a Berkely Bowl employee sat down at my table, picking his teeth and spacing out. He didn't ask if he could sit there or even if the seat was free, and the place was more than half empty. He could have easily sat at another table.I showed up early on a Sunday, not realizing the store was  not going to open for at least another half an hour. When an empoyee informed me of this, several of the employees setting up the store started laughing at me.And these are just a few examples. I could give many more.Five stars for selection. Zero stars for service. Seriously, if I could give zero stars for their employees I would.I also have some more opinions on the people who work there, but I don't use that kind of language in mixed company."
383,"Date: 6/3/2017  Time: 11:25 AM  63°  Partly sunnyMy first time coming into this store and my reaction?!? Wow...supercalifragilisticexpialidosis!!! I just hope that I spelled the word correct. It is huge...bigly. So big, that it has a cafe across from the store serving breakfast and lunch items. The cafe also has a coffee bar...nice. Definitely I will have to come back to shop and have lunch.I was amazed at what Berkeley Bowl West had to offer  - wide range of fruits and vegetables; assortment of breads, rolls, baguettes; mouth watering baked goods(cakes, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, fruit tarts); deli meats and cheese for sandwiches; floral section; meat and seafood - all at reasonable prices. They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while. The purpose of my visit was to attend the Stonewall Kitchen Jam Tour. They were supposed to be there doing a demo of their products at 12 noon. Instead the lady at the info desk told me it was scheduled for 1PM. Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking. Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."
384,"Just arrived to buy organic semolina pasta, organic mushrooms, and organic beef tenderloin. Aim on cooking stroganov in an hour for Russian night!I'm so tired today... wonder why"
385,"If crowds or parking put you off, come here on a Friday night. You'll practically have the place to yourself. I'm something of a grocery store connoisseur. I love browsing the aisles of food shops wherever I can find them. And when I travel, I almost always bring back edible souvenirs. Visiting Berkeley Bowl West is sort of like going on an exotic trip with the many amazing products they carry. The bulk offerings are truly remarkable. You can find everything from spiced rooibos chai, dried organic persimmons and hibiscus flowers to azuki beans, roasted buckwheat groats and garbanzo flour.My personal favorites are the honey roasted sesame sticks, genmaicha tea and dark chocolate chipotle almonds. I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
386,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."
387,Omg this is a paradise for produceIf your in Berkley it's worth a trip. Just to give you an idea of variety they have 12 varieties of pineapples.
388,"The vast selection of produce at Berkeley Bowl makes it a must stop whenever in the area. I'm always blown away by the mushrooms, local in-season produce, organics and the bargain bins. Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
389,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
390,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
391,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."
392,"This is my absolute favorite Berkeley Bowl! It's such a massive place and with so much produce, how can you go wrong. So much selection to chose from.  Everything in season is always a great pick. Great location as well. ... After the Oregon Berkeley Bowl. Correction, this is my second favorite Berkeley Bowl since I go to the other one more often!"
393,"Overall Berkeley Bowl West is perhaps slightly smaller than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. The bulk section might be slightly smaller here yet the produce section is perhaps bigger than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. Great place to stock up on bulk, produce, & everything else you might need even some products you never knew existed. The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."
394,"Everything you could ever need in the history of ever in the convenience of one giant store. Looking for homeopathic body products? Got it. Just need some Advil? Got it. I love that they have regular grocery store items but also have organic, natural products as well. Amazing!!"
395,"Do you want a S, M, L, or XL avocado today? Do you want strawberries from this farm or that farm? Are you looking for that uncommon produce that will go perfectly with your meal this week? Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal!

It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."
417,"Love this place, there is a large variety of healthy fruits, meats, grains, nuts, and most importantly veggies. Priced very fairly and a lot of their groceries are either locally farmed for made. Finally a health food store where packaged food and bottled food products occupy less than half of the space. This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
418,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
419,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"
420,"Came here on Thursday for the first time, loved it so much I only shopped half the store and left. Brought my girlfriend with me on Friday so we could enjoy this experience together. This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
421,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!
422,"I wish Yelp let you review different aspects of a business, because when it comes to selection and variety, this place is five stars! They have all manner of ingredients, food, and produce. It's a wonderful place to go if you're vegetarian or vegan! Just excellent.But their staff? They must beat them during their breaks or pay them $2 an hour, or perhaps they hire people who affirm their intention of being incredibly rude. A few examples:A cashier rung me up and then just stood there and stared at me. Didn't help me bag my groceries or even offer.Another cashier left her post as I walked up to go outside and pet a small dog who was tied up outside. She left me waiting there at her reigster to pet an animal, and then came back and  handled food I was buying without washing or even sanitizing her hands.Sitting in the cafe', a Berkely Bowl employee sat down at my table, picking his teeth and spacing out. He didn't ask if he could sit there or even if the seat was free, and the place was more than half empty. He could have easily sat at another table.I showed up early on a Sunday, not realizing the store was  not going to open for at least another half an hour. When an empoyee informed me of this, several of the employees setting up the store started laughing at me.And these are just a few examples. I could give many more.Five stars for selection. Zero stars for service. Seriously, if I could give zero stars for their employees I would.I also have some more opinions on the people who work there, but I don't use that kind of language in mixed company."
423,"Date: 6/3/2017  Time: 11:25 AM  63°  Partly sunnyMy first time coming into this store and my reaction?!? Wow...supercalifragilisticexpialidosis!!! I just hope that I spelled the word correct. It is huge...bigly. So big, that it has a cafe across from the store serving breakfast and lunch items. The cafe also has a coffee bar...nice. Definitely I will have to come back to shop and have lunch.I was amazed at what Berkeley Bowl West had to offer  - wide range of fruits and vegetables; assortment of breads, rolls, baguettes; mouth watering baked goods(cakes, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, fruit tarts); deli meats and cheese for sandwiches; floral section; meat and seafood - all at reasonable prices. They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while. The purpose of my visit was to attend the Stonewall Kitchen Jam Tour. They were supposed to be there doing a demo of their products at 12 noon. Instead the lady at the info desk told me it was scheduled for 1PM. Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking. Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."
424,"Just arrived to buy organic semolina pasta, organic mushrooms, and organic beef tenderloin. Aim on cooking stroganov in an hour for Russian night!I'm so tired today... wonder why"
425,"If crowds or parking put you off, come here on a Friday night. You'll practically have the place to yourself. I'm something of a grocery store connoisseur. I love browsing the aisles of food shops wherever I can find them. And when I travel, I almost always bring back edible souvenirs. Visiting Berkeley Bowl West is sort of like going on an exotic trip with the many amazing products they carry. The bulk offerings are truly remarkable. You can find everything from spiced rooibos chai, dried organic persimmons and hibiscus flowers to azuki beans, roasted buckwheat groats and garbanzo flour.My personal favorites are the honey roasted sesame sticks, genmaicha tea and dark chocolate chipotle almonds. I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
426,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."
427,Omg this is a paradise for produceIf your in Berkley it's worth a trip. Just to give you an idea of variety they have 12 varieties of pineapples.
428,"The vast selection of produce at Berkeley Bowl makes it a must stop whenever in the area. I'm always blown away by the mushrooms, local in-season produce, organics and the bargain bins. Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
429,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
430,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
431,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."
432,"This is my absolute favorite Berkeley Bowl! It's such a massive place and with so much produce, how can you go wrong. So much selection to chose from.  Everything in season is always a great pick. Great location as well. ... After the Oregon Berkeley Bowl. Correction, this is my second favorite Berkeley Bowl since I go to the other one more often!"
433,"Overall Berkeley Bowl West is perhaps slightly smaller than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. The bulk section might be slightly smaller here yet the produce section is perhaps bigger than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. Great place to stock up on bulk, produce, & everything else you might need even some products you never knew existed. The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."
434,"Everything you could ever need in the history of ever in the convenience of one giant store. Looking for homeopathic body products? Got it. Just need some Advil? Got it. I love that they have regular grocery store items but also have organic, natural products as well. Amazing!!"
435,"Do you want a S, M, L, or XL avocado today? Do you want strawberries from this farm or that farm? Are you looking for that uncommon produce that will go perfectly with your meal this week? Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal! Don't forget to grab a free cheese sample on your way in/out!"
436,"Berkeley Bowl West is great. This is a big, independent, and popular grocery store located in Southwest Berkeley. The organic produce section is huge and you can buy several foods in bulk. There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni).

This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
458,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
459,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"
460,"Came here on Thursday for the first time, loved it so much I only shopped half the store and left. Brought my girlfriend with me on Friday so we could enjoy this experience together. This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
461,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!
462,"I wish Yelp let you review different aspects of a business, because when it comes to selection and variety, this place is five stars! They have all manner of ingredients, food, and produce. It's a wonderful place to go if you're vegetarian or vegan! Just excellent.But their staff? They must beat them during their breaks or pay them $2 an hour, or perhaps they hire people who affirm their intention of being incredibly rude. A few examples:A cashier rung me up and then just stood there and stared at me. Didn't help me bag my groceries or even offer.Another cashier left her post as I walked up to go outside and pet a small dog who was tied up outside. She left me waiting there at her reigster to pet an animal, and then came back and  handled food I was buying without washing or even sanitizing her hands.Sitting in the cafe', a Berkely Bowl employee sat down at my table, picking his teeth and spacing out. He didn't ask if he could sit there or even if the seat was free, and the place was more than half empty. He could have easily sat at another table.I showed up early on a Sunday, not realizing the store was  not going to open for at least another half an hour. When an empoyee informed me of this, several of the employees setting up the store started laughing at me.And these are just a few examples. I could give many more.Five stars for selection. Zero stars for service. Seriously, if I could give zero stars for their employees I would.I also have some more opinions on the people who work there, but I don't use that kind of language in mixed company."
463,"Date: 6/3/2017  Time: 11:25 AM  63°  Partly sunnyMy first time coming into this store and my reaction?!? Wow...supercalifragilisticexpialidosis!!! I just hope that I spelled the word correct. It is huge...bigly. So big, that it has a cafe across from the store serving breakfast and lunch items. The cafe also has a coffee bar...nice. Definitely I will have to come back to shop and have lunch.I was amazed at what Berkeley Bowl West had to offer  - wide range of fruits and vegetables; assortment of breads, rolls, baguettes; mouth watering baked goods(cakes, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, fruit tarts); deli meats and cheese for sandwiches; floral section; meat and seafood - all at reasonable prices. They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while. The purpose of my visit was to attend the Stonewall Kitchen Jam Tour. They were supposed to be there doing a demo of their products at 12 noon. Instead the lady at the info desk told me it was scheduled for 1PM. Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking. Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."
464,"Just arrived to buy organic semolina pasta, organic mushrooms, and organic beef tenderloin. Aim on cooking stroganov in an hour for Russian night!I'm so tired today... wonder why"
465,"If crowds or parking put you off, come here on a Friday night. You'll practically have the place to yourself. I'm something of a grocery store connoisseur. I love browsing the aisles of food shops wherever I can find them. And when I travel, I almost always bring back edible souvenirs. Visiting Berkeley Bowl West is sort of like going on an exotic trip with the many amazing products they carry. The bulk offerings are truly remarkable. You can find everything from spiced rooibos chai, dried organic persimmons and hibiscus flowers to azuki beans, roasted buckwheat groats and garbanzo flour.My personal favorites are the honey roasted sesame sticks, genmaicha tea and dark chocolate chipotle almonds. I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
466,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."
467,Omg this is a paradise for produceIf your in Berkley it's worth a trip. Just to give you an idea of variety they have 12 varieties of pineapples.
468,"The vast selection of produce at Berkeley Bowl makes it a must stop whenever in the area. I'm always blown away by the mushrooms, local in-season produce, organics and the bargain bins. Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
469,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
470,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
471,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."
472,"This is my absolute favorite Berkeley Bowl! It's such a massive place and with so much produce, how can you go wrong. So much selection to chose from.  Everything in season is always a great pick. Great location as well. ... After the Oregon Berkeley Bowl. Correction, this is my second favorite Berkeley Bowl since I go to the other one more often!"
473,"Overall Berkeley Bowl West is perhaps slightly smaller than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. The bulk section might be slightly smaller here yet the produce section is perhaps bigger than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. Great place to stock up on bulk, produce, & everything else you might need even some products you never knew existed. The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."
474,"Everything you could ever need in the history of ever in the convenience of one giant store. Looking for homeopathic body products? Got it. Just need some Advil? Got it. I love that they have regular grocery store items but also have organic, natural products as well. Amazing!!"
475,"Do you want a S, M, L, or XL avocado today? Do you want strawberries from this farm or that farm? Are you looking for that uncommon produce that will go perfectly with your meal this week? Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal! Don't forget to grab a free cheese sample on your way in/out!"
476,"Berkeley Bowl West is great. This is a big, independent, and popular grocery store located in Southwest Berkeley. The organic produce section is huge and you can buy several foods in bulk. There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics. We got a loaf of bread, rolls, English muffins, blueberry muffins, sliced cantaloupe (1/2), sugar, sour cream, and other cooking ingredients, cartons of organic juice (apple and orange), Berkeley Farms eggnog, ice cream, assorted day-old pastries, and a spectacular fruit tart which we took to a dinner party for dessert. It was a hit.Berkeley Bowl has a nice selection of discounted day-old items from the bakery along with old produce that's still good to eat. It's the biggest I've seen of any grocery store. It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."

This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
501,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!
502,"I wish Yelp let you review different aspects of a business, because when it comes to selection and variety, this place is five stars! They have all manner of ingredients, food, and produce. It's a wonderful place to go if you're vegetarian or vegan! Just excellent.But their staff? They must beat them during their breaks or pay them $2 an hour, or perhaps they hire people who affirm their intention of being incredibly rude. A few examples:A cashier rung me up and then just stood there and stared at me. Didn't help me bag my groceries or even offer.Another cashier left her post as I walked up to go outside and pet a small dog who was tied up outside. She left me waiting there at her reigster to pet an animal, and then came back and  handled food I was buying without washing or even sanitizing her hands.Sitting in the cafe', a Berkely Bowl employee sat down at my table, picking his teeth and spacing out. He didn't ask if he could sit there or even if the seat was free, and the place was more than half empty. He could have easily sat at another table.I showed up early on a Sunday, not realizing the store was  not going to open for at least another half an hour. When an empoyee informed me of this, several of the employees setting up the store started laughing at me.And these are just a few examples. I could give many more.Five stars for selection. Zero stars for service. Seriously, if I could give zero stars for their employees I would.I also have some more opinions on the people who work there, but I don't use that kind of language in mixed company."
503,"Date: 6/3/2017  Time: 11:25 AM  63°  Partly sunnyMy first time coming into this store and my reaction?!? Wow...supercalifragilisticexpialidosis!!! I just hope that I spelled the word correct. It is huge...bigly. So big, that it has a cafe across from the store serving breakfast and lunch items. The cafe also has a coffee bar...nice. Definitely I will have to come back to shop and have lunch.I was amazed at what Berkeley Bowl West had to offer  - wide range of fruits and vegetables; assortment of breads, rolls, baguettes; mouth watering baked goods(cakes, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, fruit tarts); deli meats and cheese for sandwiches; floral section; meat and seafood - all at reasonable prices. They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while. The purpose of my visit was to attend the Stonewall Kitchen Jam Tour. They were supposed to be there doing a demo of their products at 12 noon. Instead the lady at the info desk told me it was scheduled for 1PM. Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking. Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."
504,"Just arrived to buy organic semolina pasta, organic mushrooms, and organic beef tenderloin. Aim on cooking stroganov in an hour for Russian night!I'm so tired today... wonder why"
505,"If crowds or parking put you off, come here on a Friday night. You'll practically have the place to yourself. I'm something of a grocery store connoisseur. I love browsing the aisles of food shops wherever I can find them. And when I travel, I almost always bring back edible souvenirs. Visiting Berkeley Bowl West is sort of like going on an exotic trip with the many amazing products they carry. The bulk offerings are truly remarkable. You can find everything from spiced rooibos chai, dried organic persimmons and hibiscus flowers to azuki beans, roasted buckwheat groats and garbanzo flour.My personal favorites are the honey roasted sesame sticks, genmaicha tea and dark chocolate chipotle almonds. I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
506,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."
507,Omg this is a paradise for produceIf your in Berkley it's worth a trip. Just to give you an idea of variety they have 12 varieties of pineapples.
508,"The vast selection of produce at Berkeley Bowl makes it a must stop whenever in the area. I'm always blown away by the mushrooms, local in-season produce, organics and the bargain bins. Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
509,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
510,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
511,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."
512,"This is my absolute favorite Berkeley Bowl! It's such a massive place and with so much produce, how can you go wrong. So much selection to chose from.  Everything in season is always a great pick. Great location as well. ... After the Oregon Berkeley Bowl. Correction, this is my second favorite Berkeley Bowl since I go to the other one more often!"
513,"Overall Berkeley Bowl West is perhaps slightly smaller than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. The bulk section might be slightly smaller here yet the produce section is perhaps bigger than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. Great place to stock up on bulk, produce, & everything else you might need even some products you never knew existed. The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."
514,"Everything you could ever need in the history of ever in the convenience of one giant store. Looking for homeopathic body products? Got it. Just need some Advil? Got it. I love that they have regular grocery store items but also have organic, natural products as well. Amazing!!"
515,"Do you want a S, M, L, or XL avocado today? Do you want strawberries from this farm or that farm? Are you looking for that uncommon produce that will go perfectly with your meal this week? Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal! Don't forget to grab a free cheese sample on your way in/out!"
516,"Berkeley Bowl West is great. This is a big, independent, and popular grocery store located in Southwest Berkeley. The organic produce section is huge and you can buy several foods in bulk. There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics. We got a loaf of bread, rolls, English muffins, blueberry muffins, sliced cantaloupe (1/2), sugar, sour cream, and other cooking ingredients, cartons of organic juice (apple and orange), Berkeley Farms eggnog, ice cream, assorted day-old pastries, and a spectacular fruit tart which we took to a dinner party for dessert. It was a hit.Berkeley Bowl has a nice selection of discounted day-old items from the bakery along with old produce that's still good to eat. It's the biggest I've seen of any grocery store. It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."
517,"Love this place, there is a large variety of healthy fruits, meats, grains, nuts, and most importantly veggies. Priced very fairly and a lot of their groceries are either locally farmed for made. Finally a health food store where packaged food and bottled food products occupy less than half of the space. This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
518,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
519,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"

Didn't help me bag my groceries or even offer.Another cashier left her post as I walked up to go outside and pet a small dog who was tied up outside. She left me waiting there at her reigster to pet an animal, and then came back and  handled food I was buying without washing or even sanitizing her hands.Sitting in the cafe', a Berkely Bowl employee sat down at my table, picking his teeth and spacing out. He didn't ask if he could sit there or even if the seat was free, and the place was more than half empty. He could have easily sat at another table.I showed up early on a Sunday, not realizing the store was  not going to open for at least another half an hour. When an empoyee informed me of this, several of the employees setting up the store started laughing at me.And these are just a few examples. I could give many more.Five stars for selection. Zero stars for service. Seriously, if I could give zero stars for their employees I would.I also have some more opinions on the people who work there, but I don't use that kind of language in mixed company."
543,"Date: 6/3/2017  Time: 11:25 AM  63°  Partly sunnyMy first time coming into this store and my reaction?!? Wow...supercalifragilisticexpialidosis!!! I just hope that I spelled the word correct. It is huge...bigly. So big, that it has a cafe across from the store serving breakfast and lunch items. The cafe also has a coffee bar...nice. Definitely I will have to come back to shop and have lunch.I was amazed at what Berkeley Bowl West had to offer  - wide range of fruits and vegetables; assortment of breads, rolls, baguettes; mouth watering baked goods(cakes, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, fruit tarts); deli meats and cheese for sandwiches; floral section; meat and seafood - all at reasonable prices. They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while. The purpose of my visit was to attend the Stonewall Kitchen Jam Tour. They were supposed to be there doing a demo of their products at 12 noon. Instead the lady at the info desk told me it was scheduled for 1PM. Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking. Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."
544,"Just arrived to buy organic semolina pasta, organic mushrooms, and organic beef tenderloin. Aim on cooking stroganov in an hour for Russian night!I'm so tired today... wonder why"
545,"If crowds or parking put you off, come here on a Friday night. You'll practically have the place to yourself. I'm something of a grocery store connoisseur. I love browsing the aisles of food shops wherever I can find them. And when I travel, I almost always bring back edible souvenirs. Visiting Berkeley Bowl West is sort of like going on an exotic trip with the many amazing products they carry. The bulk offerings are truly remarkable. You can find everything from spiced rooibos chai, dried organic persimmons and hibiscus flowers to azuki beans, roasted buckwheat groats and garbanzo flour.My personal favorites are the honey roasted sesame sticks, genmaicha tea and dark chocolate chipotle almonds. I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
546,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."
547,Omg this is a paradise for produceIf your in Berkley it's worth a trip. Just to give you an idea of variety they have 12 varieties of pineapples.
548,"The vast selection of produce at Berkeley Bowl makes it a must stop whenever in the area. I'm always blown away by the mushrooms, local in-season produce, organics and the bargain bins. Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
549,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
550,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
551,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."
552,"This is my absolute favorite Berkeley Bowl! It's such a massive place and with so much produce, how can you go wrong. So much selection to chose from.  Everything in season is always a great pick. Great location as well. ... After the Oregon Berkeley Bowl. Correction, this is my second favorite Berkeley Bowl since I go to the other one more often!"
553,"Overall Berkeley Bowl West is perhaps slightly smaller than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. The bulk section might be slightly smaller here yet the produce section is perhaps bigger than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. Great place to stock up on bulk, produce, & everything else you might need even some products you never knew existed. The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."
554,"Everything you could ever need in the history of ever in the convenience of one giant store. Looking for homeopathic body products? Got it. Just need some Advil? Got it. I love that they have regular grocery store items but also have organic, natural products as well. Amazing!!"
555,"Do you want a S, M, L, or XL avocado today? Do you want strawberries from this farm or that farm? Are you looking for that uncommon produce that will go perfectly with your meal this week? Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal! Don't forget to grab a free cheese sample on your way in/out!"
556,"Berkeley Bowl West is great. This is a big, independent, and popular grocery store located in Southwest Berkeley. The organic produce section is huge and you can buy several foods in bulk. There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics. We got a loaf of bread, rolls, English muffins, blueberry muffins, sliced cantaloupe (1/2), sugar, sour cream, and other cooking ingredients, cartons of organic juice (apple and orange), Berkeley Farms eggnog, ice cream, assorted day-old pastries, and a spectacular fruit tart which we took to a dinner party for dessert. It was a hit.Berkeley Bowl has a nice selection of discounted day-old items from the bakery along with old produce that's still good to eat. It's the biggest I've seen of any grocery store. It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."
557,"Love this place, there is a large variety of healthy fruits, meats, grains, nuts, and most importantly veggies. Priced very fairly and a lot of their groceries are either locally farmed for made. Finally a health food store where packaged food and bottled food products occupy less than half of the space. This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
558,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
559,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"
560,"Came here on Thursday for the first time, loved it so much I only shopped half the store and left. Brought my girlfriend with me on Friday so we could enjoy this experience together. This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
561,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!
562,"I wish Yelp let you review different aspects of a business, because when it comes to selection and variety, this place is five stars! They have all manner of ingredients, food, and produce.

Definitely I will have to come back to shop and have lunch.I was amazed at what Berkeley Bowl West had to offer  - wide range of fruits and vegetables; assortment of breads, rolls, baguettes; mouth watering baked goods(cakes, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, fruit tarts); deli meats and cheese for sandwiches; floral section; meat and seafood - all at reasonable prices. They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while. The purpose of my visit was to attend the Stonewall Kitchen Jam Tour. They were supposed to be there doing a demo of their products at 12 noon. Instead the lady at the info desk told me it was scheduled for 1PM. Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking. Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."
584,"Just arrived to buy organic semolina pasta, organic mushrooms, and organic beef tenderloin. Aim on cooking stroganov in an hour for Russian night!I'm so tired today... wonder why"
585,"If crowds or parking put you off, come here on a Friday night. You'll practically have the place to yourself. I'm something of a grocery store connoisseur. I love browsing the aisles of food shops wherever I can find them. And when I travel, I almost always bring back edible souvenirs. Visiting Berkeley Bowl West is sort of like going on an exotic trip with the many amazing products they carry. The bulk offerings are truly remarkable. You can find everything from spiced rooibos chai, dried organic persimmons and hibiscus flowers to azuki beans, roasted buckwheat groats and garbanzo flour.My personal favorites are the honey roasted sesame sticks, genmaicha tea and dark chocolate chipotle almonds. I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
586,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."
587,Omg this is a paradise for produceIf your in Berkley it's worth a trip. Just to give you an idea of variety they have 12 varieties of pineapples.
588,"The vast selection of produce at Berkeley Bowl makes it a must stop whenever in the area. I'm always blown away by the mushrooms, local in-season produce, organics and the bargain bins. Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
589,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
590,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
591,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."
592,"This is my absolute favorite Berkeley Bowl! It's such a massive place and with so much produce, how can you go wrong. So much selection to chose from.  Everything in season is always a great pick. Great location as well. ... After the Oregon Berkeley Bowl. Correction, this is my second favorite Berkeley Bowl since I go to the other one more often!"
593,"Overall Berkeley Bowl West is perhaps slightly smaller than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. The bulk section might be slightly smaller here yet the produce section is perhaps bigger than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. Great place to stock up on bulk, produce, & everything else you might need even some products you never knew existed. The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."
594,"Everything you could ever need in the history of ever in the convenience of one giant store. Looking for homeopathic body products? Got it. Just need some Advil? Got it. I love that they have regular grocery store items but also have organic, natural products as well. Amazing!!"
595,"Do you want a S, M, L, or XL avocado today? Do you want strawberries from this farm or that farm? Are you looking for that uncommon produce that will go perfectly with your meal this week? Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal! Don't forget to grab a free cheese sample on your way in/out!"
596,"Berkeley Bowl West is great. This is a big, independent, and popular grocery store located in Southwest Berkeley. The organic produce section is huge and you can buy several foods in bulk. There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics. We got a loaf of bread, rolls, English muffins, blueberry muffins, sliced cantaloupe (1/2), sugar, sour cream, and other cooking ingredients, cartons of organic juice (apple and orange), Berkeley Farms eggnog, ice cream, assorted day-old pastries, and a spectacular fruit tart which we took to a dinner party for dessert. It was a hit.Berkeley Bowl has a nice selection of discounted day-old items from the bakery along with old produce that's still good to eat. It's the biggest I've seen of any grocery store. It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."
597,"Love this place, there is a large variety of healthy fruits, meats, grains, nuts, and most importantly veggies. Priced very fairly and a lot of their groceries are either locally farmed for made. Finally a health food store where packaged food and bottled food products occupy less than half of the space. This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
598,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
599,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"
600,"Came here on Thursday for the first time, loved it so much I only shopped half the store and left. Brought my girlfriend with me on Friday so we could enjoy this experience together. This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
601,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!
602,"I wish Yelp let you review different aspects of a business, because when it comes to selection and variety, this place is five stars! They have all manner of ingredients, food, and produce. It's a wonderful place to go if you're vegetarian or vegan! Just excellent.But their staff? They must beat them during their breaks or pay them $2 an hour, or perhaps they hire people who affirm their intention of being incredibly rude. A few examples:A cashier rung me up and then just stood there and stared at me. Didn't help me bag my groceries or even offer.Another cashier left her post as I walked up to go outside and pet a small dog who was tied up outside. She left me waiting there at her reigster to pet an animal, and then came back and  handled food I was buying without washing or even sanitizing her hands.Sitting in the cafe', a Berkely Bowl employee sat down at my table, picking his teeth and spacing out. He didn't ask if he could sit there or even if the seat was free, and the place was more than half empty. He could have easily sat at another table.I showed up early on a Sunday, not realizing the store was  not going to open for at least another half an hour. When an empoyee informed me of this, several of the employees setting up the store started laughing at me.And these are just a few examples. I could give many more.Five stars for selection. Zero stars for service. Seriously, if I could give zero stars for their employees I would.I also have some more opinions on the people who work there, but I don't use that kind of language in mixed company."

Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."
624,"Just arrived to buy organic semolina pasta, organic mushrooms, and organic beef tenderloin. Aim on cooking stroganov in an hour for Russian night!I'm so tired today... wonder why"
625,"If crowds or parking put you off, come here on a Friday night. You'll practically have the place to yourself. I'm something of a grocery store connoisseur. I love browsing the aisles of food shops wherever I can find them. And when I travel, I almost always bring back edible souvenirs. Visiting Berkeley Bowl West is sort of like going on an exotic trip with the many amazing products they carry. The bulk offerings are truly remarkable. You can find everything from spiced rooibos chai, dried organic persimmons and hibiscus flowers to azuki beans, roasted buckwheat groats and garbanzo flour.My personal favorites are the honey roasted sesame sticks, genmaicha tea and dark chocolate chipotle almonds. I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
626,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."
627,Omg this is a paradise for produceIf your in Berkley it's worth a trip. Just to give you an idea of variety they have 12 varieties of pineapples.
628,"The vast selection of produce at Berkeley Bowl makes it a must stop whenever in the area. I'm always blown away by the mushrooms, local in-season produce, organics and the bargain bins. Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
629,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
630,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
631,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."
632,"This is my absolute favorite Berkeley Bowl! It's such a massive place and with so much produce, how can you go wrong. So much selection to chose from.  Everything in season is always a great pick. Great location as well. ... After the Oregon Berkeley Bowl. Correction, this is my second favorite Berkeley Bowl since I go to the other one more often!"
633,"Overall Berkeley Bowl West is perhaps slightly smaller than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. The bulk section might be slightly smaller here yet the produce section is perhaps bigger than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. Great place to stock up on bulk, produce, & everything else you might need even some products you never knew existed. The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."
634,"Everything you could ever need in the history of ever in the convenience of one giant store. Looking for homeopathic body products? Got it. Just need some Advil? Got it. I love that they have regular grocery store items but also have organic, natural products as well. Amazing!!"
635,"Do you want a S, M, L, or XL avocado today? Do you want strawberries from this farm or that farm? Are you looking for that uncommon produce that will go perfectly with your meal this week? Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal! Don't forget to grab a free cheese sample on your way in/out!"
636,"Berkeley Bowl West is great. This is a big, independent, and popular grocery store located in Southwest Berkeley. The organic produce section is huge and you can buy several foods in bulk. There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics. We got a loaf of bread, rolls, English muffins, blueberry muffins, sliced cantaloupe (1/2), sugar, sour cream, and other cooking ingredients, cartons of organic juice (apple and orange), Berkeley Farms eggnog, ice cream, assorted day-old pastries, and a spectacular fruit tart which we took to a dinner party for dessert. It was a hit.Berkeley Bowl has a nice selection of discounted day-old items from the bakery along with old produce that's still good to eat. It's the biggest I've seen of any grocery store. It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."
637,"Love this place, there is a large variety of healthy fruits, meats, grains, nuts, and most importantly veggies. Priced very fairly and a lot of their groceries are either locally farmed for made. Finally a health food store where packaged food and bottled food products occupy less than half of the space. This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
638,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
639,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"
640,"Came here on Thursday for the first time, loved it so much I only shopped half the store and left. Brought my girlfriend with me on Friday so we could enjoy this experience together. This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
641,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!
642,"I wish Yelp let you review different aspects of a business, because when it comes to selection and variety, this place is five stars! They have all manner of ingredients, food, and produce. It's a wonderful place to go if you're vegetarian or vegan! Just excellent.But their staff? They must beat them during their breaks or pay them $2 an hour, or perhaps they hire people who affirm their intention of being incredibly rude. A few examples:A cashier rung me up and then just stood there and stared at me. Didn't help me bag my groceries or even offer.Another cashier left her post as I walked up to go outside and pet a small dog who was tied up outside. She left me waiting there at her reigster to pet an animal, and then came back and  handled food I was buying without washing or even sanitizing her hands.Sitting in the cafe', a Berkely Bowl employee sat down at my table, picking his teeth and spacing out. He didn't ask if he could sit there or even if the seat was free, and the place was more than half empty. He could have easily sat at another table.I showed up early on a Sunday, not realizing the store was  not going to open for at least another half an hour. When an empoyee informed me of this, several of the employees setting up the store started laughing at me.And these are just a few examples. I could give many more.Five stars for selection. Zero stars for service. Seriously, if I could give zero stars for their employees I would.I also have some more opinions on the people who work there, but I don't use that kind of language in mixed company."

They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while.

I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
666,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."
667,Omg this is a paradise for produceIf your in Berkley it's worth a trip. Just to give you an idea of variety they have 12 varieties of pineapples.
668,"The vast selection of produce at Berkeley Bowl makes it a must stop whenever in the area. I'm always blown away by the mushrooms, local in-season produce, organics and the bargain bins. Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
669,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
670,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
671,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."
672,"This is my absolute favorite Berkeley Bowl! It's such a massive place and with so much produce, how can you go wrong. So much selection to chose from.  Everything in season is always a great pick. Great location as well. ... After the Oregon Berkeley Bowl. Correction, this is my second favorite Berkeley Bowl since I go to the other one more often!"
673,"Overall Berkeley Bowl West is perhaps slightly smaller than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. The bulk section might be slightly smaller here yet the produce section is perhaps bigger than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. Great place to stock up on bulk, produce, & everything else you might need even some products you never knew existed. The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."
674,"Everything you could ever need in the history of ever in the convenience of one giant store. Looking for homeopathic body products? Got it. Just need some Advil? Got it. I love that they have regular grocery store items but also have organic, natural products as well. Amazing!!"
675,"Do you want a S, M, L, or XL avocado today? Do you want strawberries from this farm or that farm? Are you looking for that uncommon produce that will go perfectly with your meal this week? Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal! Don't forget to grab a free cheese sample on your way in/out!"
676,"Berkeley Bowl West is great. This is a big, independent, and popular grocery store located in Southwest Berkeley. The organic produce section is huge and you can buy several foods in bulk. There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics. We got a loaf of bread, rolls, English muffins, blueberry muffins, sliced cantaloupe (1/2), sugar, sour cream, and other cooking ingredients, cartons of organic juice (apple and orange), Berkeley Farms eggnog, ice cream, assorted day-old pastries, and a spectacular fruit tart which we took to a dinner party for dessert. It was a hit.Berkeley Bowl has a nice selection of discounted day-old items from the bakery along with old produce that's still good to eat. It's the biggest I've seen of any grocery store. It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."
677,"Love this place, there is a large variety of healthy fruits, meats, grains, nuts, and most importantly veggies. Priced very fairly and a lot of their groceries are either locally farmed for made. Finally a health food store where packaged food and bottled food products occupy less than half of the space. This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
678,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
679,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"
680,"Came here on Thursday for the first time, loved it so much I only shopped half the store and left. Brought my girlfriend with me on Friday so we could enjoy this experience together. This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
681,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!
682,"I wish Yelp let you review different aspects of a business, because when it comes to selection and variety, this place is five stars! They have all manner of ingredients, food, and produce. It's a wonderful place to go if you're vegetarian or vegan! Just excellent.But their staff? They must beat them during their breaks or pay them $2 an hour, or perhaps they hire people who affirm their intention of being incredibly rude. A few examples:A cashier rung me up and then just stood there and stared at me. Didn't help me bag my groceries or even offer.Another cashier left her post as I walked up to go outside and pet a small dog who was tied up outside. She left me waiting there at her reigster to pet an animal, and then came back and  handled food I was buying without washing or even sanitizing her hands.Sitting in the cafe', a Berkely Bowl employee sat down at my table, picking his teeth and spacing out. He didn't ask if he could sit there or even if the seat was free, and the place was more than half empty. He could have easily sat at another table.I showed up early on a Sunday, not realizing the store was  not going to open for at least another half an hour. When an empoyee informed me of this, several of the employees setting up the store started laughing at me.And these are just a few examples. I could give many more.Five stars for selection. Zero stars for service. Seriously, if I could give zero stars for their employees I would.I also have some more opinions on the people who work there, but I don't use that kind of language in mixed company."
683,"Date: 6/3/2017  Time: 11:25 AM  63°  Partly sunnyMy first time coming into this store and my reaction?!? Wow...supercalifragilisticexpialidosis!!! I just hope that I spelled the word correct. It is huge...bigly. So big, that it has a cafe across from the store serving breakfast and lunch items. The cafe also has a coffee bar...nice. Definitely I will have to come back to shop and have lunch.I was amazed at what Berkeley Bowl West had to offer  - wide range of fruits and vegetables; assortment of breads, rolls, baguettes; mouth watering baked goods(cakes, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, fruit tarts); deli meats and cheese for sandwiches; floral section; meat and seafood - all at reasonable prices. They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while. The purpose of my visit was to attend the Stonewall Kitchen Jam Tour. They were supposed to be there doing a demo of their products at 12 noon. Instead the lady at the info desk told me it was scheduled for 1PM. Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking. Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."

Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
709,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
710,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
711,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."
712,"This is my absolute favorite Berkeley Bowl! It's such a massive place and with so much produce, how can you go wrong. So much selection to chose from.  Everything in season is always a great pick. Great location as well. ... After the Oregon Berkeley Bowl. Correction, this is my second favorite Berkeley Bowl since I go to the other one more often!"
713,"Overall Berkeley Bowl West is perhaps slightly smaller than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. The bulk section might be slightly smaller here yet the produce section is perhaps bigger than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. Great place to stock up on bulk, produce, & everything else you might need even some products you never knew existed. The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."
714,"Everything you could ever need in the history of ever in the convenience of one giant store. Looking for homeopathic body products? Got it. Just need some Advil? Got it. I love that they have regular grocery store items but also have organic, natural products as well. Amazing!!"
715,"Do you want a S, M, L, or XL avocado today? Do you want strawberries from this farm or that farm? Are you looking for that uncommon produce that will go perfectly with your meal this week? Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal! Don't forget to grab a free cheese sample on your way in/out!"
716,"Berkeley Bowl West is great. This is a big, independent, and popular grocery store located in Southwest Berkeley. The organic produce section is huge and you can buy several foods in bulk. There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics. We got a loaf of bread, rolls, English muffins, blueberry muffins, sliced cantaloupe (1/2), sugar, sour cream, and other cooking ingredients, cartons of organic juice (apple and orange), Berkeley Farms eggnog, ice cream, assorted day-old pastries, and a spectacular fruit tart which we took to a dinner party for dessert. It was a hit.Berkeley Bowl has a nice selection of discounted day-old items from the bakery along with old produce that's still good to eat. It's the biggest I've seen of any grocery store. It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."
717,"Love this place, there is a large variety of healthy fruits, meats, grains, nuts, and most importantly veggies. Priced very fairly and a lot of their groceries are either locally farmed for made. Finally a health food store where packaged food and bottled food products occupy less than half of the space. This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
718,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
719,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"
720,"Came here on Thursday for the first time, loved it so much I only shopped half the store and left. Brought my girlfriend with me on Friday so we could enjoy this experience together. This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
721,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!
722,"I wish Yelp let you review different aspects of a business, because when it comes to selection and variety, this place is five stars! They have all manner of ingredients, food, and produce. It's a wonderful place to go if you're vegetarian or vegan! Just excellent.But their staff? They must beat them during their breaks or pay them $2 an hour, or perhaps they hire people who affirm their intention of being incredibly rude. A few examples:A cashier rung me up and then just stood there and stared at me. Didn't help me bag my groceries or even offer.Another cashier left her post as I walked up to go outside and pet a small dog who was tied up outside. She left me waiting there at her reigster to pet an animal, and then came back and  handled food I was buying without washing or even sanitizing her hands.Sitting in the cafe', a Berkely Bowl employee sat down at my table, picking his teeth and spacing out. He didn't ask if he could sit there or even if the seat was free, and the place was more than half empty. He could have easily sat at another table.I showed up early on a Sunday, not realizing the store was  not going to open for at least another half an hour. When an empoyee informed me of this, several of the employees setting up the store started laughing at me.And these are just a few examples. I could give many more.Five stars for selection. Zero stars for service. Seriously, if I could give zero stars for their employees I would.I also have some more opinions on the people who work there, but I don't use that kind of language in mixed company."
723,"Date: 6/3/2017  Time: 11:25 AM  63°  Partly sunnyMy first time coming into this store and my reaction?!? Wow...supercalifragilisticexpialidosis!!! I just hope that I spelled the word correct. It is huge...bigly. So big, that it has a cafe across from the store serving breakfast and lunch items. The cafe also has a coffee bar...nice. Definitely I will have to come back to shop and have lunch.I was amazed at what Berkeley Bowl West had to offer  - wide range of fruits and vegetables; assortment of breads, rolls, baguettes; mouth watering baked goods(cakes, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, fruit tarts); deli meats and cheese for sandwiches; floral section; meat and seafood - all at reasonable prices. They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while. The purpose of my visit was to attend the Stonewall Kitchen Jam Tour. They were supposed to be there doing a demo of their products at 12 noon. Instead the lady at the info desk told me it was scheduled for 1PM. Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking. Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."

Visiting Berkeley Bowl West is sort of like going on an exotic trip with the many amazing products they carry. The bulk offerings are truly remarkable. You can find everything from spiced rooibos chai, dried organic persimmons and hibiscus flowers to azuki beans, roasted buckwheat groats and garbanzo flour.My personal favorites are the honey roasted sesame sticks, genmaicha tea and dark chocolate chipotle almonds. I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
726,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."

From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."
752,"This is my absolute favorite Berkeley Bowl! It's such a massive place and with so much produce, how can you go wrong. So much selection to chose from.  Everything in season is always a great pick. Great location as well. ... After the Oregon Berkeley Bowl. Correction, this is my second favorite Berkeley Bowl since I go to the other one more often!"
753,"Overall Berkeley Bowl West is perhaps slightly smaller than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. The bulk section might be slightly smaller here yet the produce section is perhaps bigger than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. Great place to stock up on bulk, produce, & everything else you might need even some products you never knew existed. The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."
754,"Everything you could ever need in the history of ever in the convenience of one giant store. Looking for homeopathic body products? Got it. Just need some Advil? Got it. I love that they have regular grocery store items but also have organic, natural products as well. Amazing!!"
755,"Do you want a S, M, L, or XL avocado today? Do you want strawberries from this farm or that farm? Are you looking for that uncommon produce that will go perfectly with your meal this week? Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal! Don't forget to grab a free cheese sample on your way in/out!"
756,"Berkeley Bowl West is great. This is a big, independent, and popular grocery store located in Southwest Berkeley. The organic produce section is huge and you can buy several foods in bulk. There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics. We got a loaf of bread, rolls, English muffins, blueberry muffins, sliced cantaloupe (1/2), sugar, sour cream, and other cooking ingredients, cartons of organic juice (apple and orange), Berkeley Farms eggnog, ice cream, assorted day-old pastries, and a spectacular fruit tart which we took to a dinner party for dessert. It was a hit.Berkeley Bowl has a nice selection of discounted day-old items from the bakery along with old produce that's still good to eat. It's the biggest I've seen of any grocery store. It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."
757,"Love this place, there is a large variety of healthy fruits, meats, grains, nuts, and most importantly veggies. Priced very fairly and a lot of their groceries are either locally farmed for made. Finally a health food store where packaged food and bottled food products occupy less than half of the space. This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
758,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
759,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"
760,"Came here on Thursday for the first time, loved it so much I only shopped half the store and left. Brought my girlfriend with me on Friday so we could enjoy this experience together. This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
761,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!
762,"I wish Yelp let you review different aspects of a business, because when it comes to selection and variety, this place is five stars! They have all manner of ingredients, food, and produce. It's a wonderful place to go if you're vegetarian or vegan! Just excellent.But their staff? They must beat them during their breaks or pay them $2 an hour, or perhaps they hire people who affirm their intention of being incredibly rude. A few examples:A cashier rung me up and then just stood there and stared at me. Didn't help me bag my groceries or even offer.Another cashier left her post as I walked up to go outside and pet a small dog who was tied up outside. She left me waiting there at her reigster to pet an animal, and then came back and  handled food I was buying without washing or even sanitizing her hands.Sitting in the cafe', a Berkely Bowl employee sat down at my table, picking his teeth and spacing out. He didn't ask if he could sit there or even if the seat was free, and the place was more than half empty. He could have easily sat at another table.I showed up early on a Sunday, not realizing the store was  not going to open for at least another half an hour. When an empoyee informed me of this, several of the employees setting up the store started laughing at me.And these are just a few examples. I could give many more.Five stars for selection. Zero stars for service. Seriously, if I could give zero stars for their employees I would.I also have some more opinions on the people who work there, but I don't use that kind of language in mixed company."
763,"Date: 6/3/2017  Time: 11:25 AM  63°  Partly sunnyMy first time coming into this store and my reaction?!? Wow...supercalifragilisticexpialidosis!!! I just hope that I spelled the word correct. It is huge...bigly. So big, that it has a cafe across from the store serving breakfast and lunch items. The cafe also has a coffee bar...nice. Definitely I will have to come back to shop and have lunch.I was amazed at what Berkeley Bowl West had to offer  - wide range of fruits and vegetables; assortment of breads, rolls, baguettes; mouth watering baked goods(cakes, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, fruit tarts); deli meats and cheese for sandwiches; floral section; meat and seafood - all at reasonable prices. They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while. The purpose of my visit was to attend the Stonewall Kitchen Jam Tour. They were supposed to be there doing a demo of their products at 12 noon. Instead the lady at the info desk told me it was scheduled for 1PM. Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking. Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."
764,"Just arrived to buy organic semolina pasta, organic mushrooms, and organic beef tenderloin. Aim on cooking stroganov in an hour for Russian night!I'm so tired today... wonder why"
765,"If crowds or parking put you off, come here on a Friday night. You'll practically have the place to yourself. I'm something of a grocery store connoisseur. I love browsing the aisles of food shops wherever I can find them. And when I travel, I almost always bring back edible souvenirs. Visiting Berkeley Bowl West is sort of like going on an exotic trip with the many amazing products they carry. The bulk offerings are truly remarkable. You can find everything from spiced rooibos chai, dried organic persimmons and hibiscus flowers to azuki beans, roasted buckwheat groats and garbanzo flour.My personal favorites are the honey roasted sesame sticks, genmaicha tea and dark chocolate chipotle almonds. I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
766,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."
767,Omg this is a paradise for produceIf your in Berkley it's worth a trip. Just to give you an idea of variety they have 12 varieties of pineapples.
768,"The vast selection of produce at Berkeley Bowl makes it a must stop whenever in the area. I'm always blown away by the mushrooms, local in-season produce, organics and the bargain bins. Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
769,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
770,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"

The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."
794,"Everything you could ever need in the history of ever in the convenience of one giant store. Looking for homeopathic body products? Got it. Just need some Advil? Got it. I love that they have regular grocery store items but also have organic, natural products as well. Amazing!!"
795,"Do you want a S, M, L, or XL avocado today? Do you want strawberries from this farm or that farm? Are you looking for that uncommon produce that will go perfectly with your meal this week? Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal! Don't forget to grab a free cheese sample on your way in/out!"
796,"Berkeley Bowl West is great. This is a big, independent, and popular grocery store located in Southwest Berkeley. The organic produce section is huge and you can buy several foods in bulk. There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics. We got a loaf of bread, rolls, English muffins, blueberry muffins, sliced cantaloupe (1/2), sugar, sour cream, and other cooking ingredients, cartons of organic juice (apple and orange), Berkeley Farms eggnog, ice cream, assorted day-old pastries, and a spectacular fruit tart which we took to a dinner party for dessert. It was a hit.Berkeley Bowl has a nice selection of discounted day-old items from the bakery along with old produce that's still good to eat. It's the biggest I've seen of any grocery store. It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."
797,"Love this place, there is a large variety of healthy fruits, meats, grains, nuts, and most importantly veggies. Priced very fairly and a lot of their groceries are either locally farmed for made. Finally a health food store where packaged food and bottled food products occupy less than half of the space. This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
798,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
799,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"
800,"Came here on Thursday for the first time, loved it so much I only shopped half the store and left. Brought my girlfriend with me on Friday so we could enjoy this experience together. This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
801,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!
802,"I wish Yelp let you review different aspects of a business, because when it comes to selection and variety, this place is five stars! They have all manner of ingredients, food, and produce. It's a wonderful place to go if you're vegetarian or vegan! Just excellent.But their staff? They must beat them during their breaks or pay them $2 an hour, or perhaps they hire people who affirm their intention of being incredibly rude. A few examples:A cashier rung me up and then just stood there and stared at me. Didn't help me bag my groceries or even offer.Another cashier left her post as I walked up to go outside and pet a small dog who was tied up outside. She left me waiting there at her reigster to pet an animal, and then came back and  handled food I was buying without washing or even sanitizing her hands.Sitting in the cafe', a Berkely Bowl employee sat down at my table, picking his teeth and spacing out. He didn't ask if he could sit there or even if the seat was free, and the place was more than half empty. He could have easily sat at another table.I showed up early on a Sunday, not realizing the store was  not going to open for at least another half an hour. When an empoyee informed me of this, several of the employees setting up the store started laughing at me.And these are just a few examples. I could give many more.Five stars for selection. Zero stars for service. Seriously, if I could give zero stars for their employees I would.I also have some more opinions on the people who work there, but I don't use that kind of language in mixed company."
803,"Date: 6/3/2017  Time: 11:25 AM  63°  Partly sunnyMy first time coming into this store and my reaction?!? Wow...supercalifragilisticexpialidosis!!! I just hope that I spelled the word correct. It is huge...bigly. So big, that it has a cafe across from the store serving breakfast and lunch items. The cafe also has a coffee bar...nice. Definitely I will have to come back to shop and have lunch.I was amazed at what Berkeley Bowl West had to offer  - wide range of fruits and vegetables; assortment of breads, rolls, baguettes; mouth watering baked goods(cakes, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, fruit tarts); deli meats and cheese for sandwiches; floral section; meat and seafood - all at reasonable prices. They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while. The purpose of my visit was to attend the Stonewall Kitchen Jam Tour. They were supposed to be there doing a demo of their products at 12 noon. Instead the lady at the info desk told me it was scheduled for 1PM. Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking. Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."
804,"Just arrived to buy organic semolina pasta, organic mushrooms, and organic beef tenderloin. Aim on cooking stroganov in an hour for Russian night!I'm so tired today... wonder why"
805,"If crowds or parking put you off, come here on a Friday night. You'll practically have the place to yourself. I'm something of a grocery store connoisseur. I love browsing the aisles of food shops wherever I can find them. And when I travel, I almost always bring back edible souvenirs. Visiting Berkeley Bowl West is sort of like going on an exotic trip with the many amazing products they carry. The bulk offerings are truly remarkable. You can find everything from spiced rooibos chai, dried organic persimmons and hibiscus flowers to azuki beans, roasted buckwheat groats and garbanzo flour.My personal favorites are the honey roasted sesame sticks, genmaicha tea and dark chocolate chipotle almonds. I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
806,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."
807,Omg this is a paradise for produceIf your in Berkley it's worth a trip. Just to give you an idea of variety they have 12 varieties of pineapples.
808,"The vast selection of produce at Berkeley Bowl makes it a must stop whenever in the area. I'm always blown away by the mushrooms, local in-season produce, organics and the bargain bins. Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
809,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
810,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
811,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."

Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal! Don't forget to grab a free cheese sample on your way in/out!"
836,"Berkeley Bowl West is great. This is a big, independent, and popular grocery store located in Southwest Berkeley. The organic produce section is huge and you can buy several foods in bulk. There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics. We got a loaf of bread, rolls, English muffins, blueberry muffins, sliced cantaloupe (1/2), sugar, sour cream, and other cooking ingredients, cartons of organic juice (apple and orange), Berkeley Farms eggnog, ice cream, assorted day-old pastries, and a spectacular fruit tart which we took to a dinner party for dessert. It was a hit.Berkeley Bowl has a nice selection of discounted day-old items from the bakery along with old produce that's still good to eat. It's the biggest I've seen of any grocery store. It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."
837,"Love this place, there is a large variety of healthy fruits, meats, grains, nuts, and most importantly veggies. Priced very fairly and a lot of their groceries are either locally farmed for made. Finally a health food store where packaged food and bottled food products occupy less than half of the space. This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
838,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
839,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"
840,"Came here on Thursday for the first time, loved it so much I only shopped half the store and left. Brought my girlfriend with me on Friday so we could enjoy this experience together. This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
841,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!
842,"I wish Yelp let you review different aspects of a business, because when it comes to selection and variety, this place is five stars! They have all manner of ingredients, food, and produce. It's a wonderful place to go if you're vegetarian or vegan! Just excellent.But their staff? They must beat them during their breaks or pay them $2 an hour, or perhaps they hire people who affirm their intention of being incredibly rude. A few examples:A cashier rung me up and then just stood there and stared at me. Didn't help me bag my groceries or even offer.Another cashier left her post as I walked up to go outside and pet a small dog who was tied up outside. She left me waiting there at her reigster to pet an animal, and then came back and  handled food I was buying without washing or even sanitizing her hands.Sitting in the cafe', a Berkely Bowl employee sat down at my table, picking his teeth and spacing out. He didn't ask if he could sit there or even if the seat was free, and the place was more than half empty. He could have easily sat at another table.I showed up early on a Sunday, not realizing the store was  not going to open for at least another half an hour. When an empoyee informed me of this, several of the employees setting up the store started laughing at me.And these are just a few examples. I could give many more.Five stars for selection. Zero stars for service. Seriously, if I could give zero stars for their employees I would.I also have some more opinions on the people who work there, but I don't use that kind of language in mixed company."
843,"Date: 6/3/2017  Time: 11:25 AM  63°  Partly sunnyMy first time coming into this store and my reaction?!? Wow...supercalifragilisticexpialidosis!!! I just hope that I spelled the word correct. It is huge...bigly. So big, that it has a cafe across from the store serving breakfast and lunch items. The cafe also has a coffee bar...nice. Definitely I will have to come back to shop and have lunch.I was amazed at what Berkeley Bowl West had to offer  - wide range of fruits and vegetables; assortment of breads, rolls, baguettes; mouth watering baked goods(cakes, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, fruit tarts); deli meats and cheese for sandwiches; floral section; meat and seafood - all at reasonable prices. They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while. The purpose of my visit was to attend the Stonewall Kitchen Jam Tour. They were supposed to be there doing a demo of their products at 12 noon. Instead the lady at the info desk told me it was scheduled for 1PM. Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking. Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."
844,"Just arrived to buy organic semolina pasta, organic mushrooms, and organic beef tenderloin. Aim on cooking stroganov in an hour for Russian night!I'm so tired today... wonder why"
845,"If crowds or parking put you off, come here on a Friday night. You'll practically have the place to yourself. I'm something of a grocery store connoisseur. I love browsing the aisles of food shops wherever I can find them. And when I travel, I almost always bring back edible souvenirs. Visiting Berkeley Bowl West is sort of like going on an exotic trip with the many amazing products they carry. The bulk offerings are truly remarkable. You can find everything from spiced rooibos chai, dried organic persimmons and hibiscus flowers to azuki beans, roasted buckwheat groats and garbanzo flour.My personal favorites are the honey roasted sesame sticks, genmaicha tea and dark chocolate chipotle almonds. I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
846,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."
847,Omg this is a paradise for produceIf your in Berkley it's worth a trip. Just to give you an idea of variety they have 12 varieties of pineapples.
848,"The vast selection of produce at Berkeley Bowl makes it a must stop whenever in the area. I'm always blown away by the mushrooms, local in-season produce, organics and the bargain bins. Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
849,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
850,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
851,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."
852,"This is my absolute favorite Berkeley Bowl! It's such a massive place and with so much produce, how can you go wrong.

Correction, this is my second favorite Berkeley Bowl since I go to the other one more often!"
853,"Overall Berkeley Bowl West is perhaps slightly smaller than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. The bulk section might be slightly smaller here yet the produce section is perhaps bigger than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. Great place to stock up on bulk, produce, & everything else you might need even some products you never knew existed. The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."

There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics. We got a loaf of bread, rolls, English muffins, blueberry muffins, sliced cantaloupe (1/2), sugar, sour cream, and other cooking ingredients, cartons of organic juice (apple and orange), Berkeley Farms eggnog, ice cream, assorted day-old pastries, and a spectacular fruit tart which we took to a dinner party for dessert. It was a hit.Berkeley Bowl has a nice selection of discounted day-old items from the bakery along with old produce that's still good to eat. It's the biggest I've seen of any grocery store. It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."
877,"Love this place, there is a large variety of healthy fruits, meats, grains, nuts, and most importantly veggies. Priced very fairly and a lot of their groceries are either locally farmed for made. Finally a health food store where packaged food and bottled food products occupy less than half of the space. This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
878,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
879,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"
880,"Came here on Thursday for the first time, loved it so much I only shopped half the store and left. Brought my girlfriend with me on Friday so we could enjoy this experience together. This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
881,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!
882,"I wish Yelp let you review different aspects of a business, because when it comes to selection and variety, this place is five stars! They have all manner of ingredients, food, and produce. It's a wonderful place to go if you're vegetarian or vegan! Just excellent.But their staff? They must beat them during their breaks or pay them $2 an hour, or perhaps they hire people who affirm their intention of being incredibly rude. A few examples:A cashier rung me up and then just stood there and stared at me. Didn't help me bag my groceries or even offer.Another cashier left her post as I walked up to go outside and pet a small dog who was tied up outside. She left me waiting there at her reigster to pet an animal, and then came back and  handled food I was buying without washing or even sanitizing her hands.Sitting in the cafe', a Berkely Bowl employee sat down at my table, picking his teeth and spacing out. He didn't ask if he could sit there or even if the seat was free, and the place was more than half empty. He could have easily sat at another table.I showed up early on a Sunday, not realizing the store was  not going to open for at least another half an hour. When an empoyee informed me of this, several of the employees setting up the store started laughing at me.And these are just a few examples. I could give many more.Five stars for selection. Zero stars for service. Seriously, if I could give zero stars for their employees I would.I also have some more opinions on the people who work there, but I don't use that kind of language in mixed company."
883,"Date: 6/3/2017  Time: 11:25 AM  63°  Partly sunnyMy first time coming into this store and my reaction?!? Wow...supercalifragilisticexpialidosis!!! I just hope that I spelled the word correct. It is huge...bigly. So big, that it has a cafe across from the store serving breakfast and lunch items. The cafe also has a coffee bar...nice. Definitely I will have to come back to shop and have lunch.I was amazed at what Berkeley Bowl West had to offer  - wide range of fruits and vegetables; assortment of breads, rolls, baguettes; mouth watering baked goods(cakes, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, fruit tarts); deli meats and cheese for sandwiches; floral section; meat and seafood - all at reasonable prices. They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while. The purpose of my visit was to attend the Stonewall Kitchen Jam Tour. They were supposed to be there doing a demo of their products at 12 noon. Instead the lady at the info desk told me it was scheduled for 1PM. Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking. Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."
884,"Just arrived to buy organic semolina pasta, organic mushrooms, and organic beef tenderloin. Aim on cooking stroganov in an hour for Russian night!I'm so tired today... wonder why"
885,"If crowds or parking put you off, come here on a Friday night. You'll practically have the place to yourself. I'm something of a grocery store connoisseur. I love browsing the aisles of food shops wherever I can find them. And when I travel, I almost always bring back edible souvenirs. Visiting Berkeley Bowl West is sort of like going on an exotic trip with the many amazing products they carry. The bulk offerings are truly remarkable. You can find everything from spiced rooibos chai, dried organic persimmons and hibiscus flowers to azuki beans, roasted buckwheat groats and garbanzo flour.My personal favorites are the honey roasted sesame sticks, genmaicha tea and dark chocolate chipotle almonds. I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
886,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."
887,Omg this is a paradise for produceIf your in Berkley it's worth a trip. Just to give you an idea of variety they have 12 varieties of pineapples.
888,"The vast selection of produce at Berkeley Bowl makes it a must stop whenever in the area. I'm always blown away by the mushrooms, local in-season produce, organics and the bargain bins. Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
889,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
890,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
891,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."
892,"This is my absolute favorite Berkeley Bowl! It's such a massive place and with so much produce, how can you go wrong. So much selection to chose from.  Everything in season is always a great pick. Great location as well. ... After the Oregon Berkeley Bowl. Correction, this is my second favorite Berkeley Bowl since I go to the other one more often!"
893,"Overall Berkeley Bowl West is perhaps slightly smaller than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. The bulk section might be slightly smaller here yet the produce section is perhaps bigger than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. Great place to stock up on bulk, produce, & everything else you might need even some products you never knew existed. The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."
894,"Everything you could ever need in the history of ever in the convenience of one giant store. Looking for homeopathic body products? Got it. Just need some Advil? Got it. I love that they have regular grocery store items but also have organic, natural products as well. Amazing!!"
895,"Do you want a S, M, L, or XL avocado today? Do you want strawberries from this farm or that farm? Are you looking for that uncommon produce that will go perfectly with your meal this week? Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal!

It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."
917,"Love this place, there is a large variety of healthy fruits, meats, grains, nuts, and most importantly veggies. Priced very fairly and a lot of their groceries are either locally farmed for made. Finally a health food store where packaged food and bottled food products occupy less than half of the space. This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
918,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
919,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"
920,"Came here on Thursday for the first time, loved it so much I only shopped half the store and left. Brought my girlfriend with me on Friday so we could enjoy this experience together. This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
921,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!
922,"I wish Yelp let you review different aspects of a business, because when it comes to selection and variety, this place is five stars! They have all manner of ingredients, food, and produce. It's a wonderful place to go if you're vegetarian or vegan! Just excellent.But their staff? They must beat them during their breaks or pay them $2 an hour, or perhaps they hire people who affirm their intention of being incredibly rude. A few examples:A cashier rung me up and then just stood there and stared at me. Didn't help me bag my groceries or even offer.Another cashier left her post as I walked up to go outside and pet a small dog who was tied up outside. She left me waiting there at her reigster to pet an animal, and then came back and  handled food I was buying without washing or even sanitizing her hands.Sitting in the cafe', a Berkely Bowl employee sat down at my table, picking his teeth and spacing out. He didn't ask if he could sit there or even if the seat was free, and the place was more than half empty. He could have easily sat at another table.I showed up early on a Sunday, not realizing the store was  not going to open for at least another half an hour. When an empoyee informed me of this, several of the employees setting up the store started laughing at me.And these are just a few examples. I could give many more.Five stars for selection. Zero stars for service. Seriously, if I could give zero stars for their employees I would.I also have some more opinions on the people who work there, but I don't use that kind of language in mixed company."
923,"Date: 6/3/2017  Time: 11:25 AM  63°  Partly sunnyMy first time coming into this store and my reaction?!? Wow...supercalifragilisticexpialidosis!!! I just hope that I spelled the word correct. It is huge...bigly. So big, that it has a cafe across from the store serving breakfast and lunch items. The cafe also has a coffee bar...nice. Definitely I will have to come back to shop and have lunch.I was amazed at what Berkeley Bowl West had to offer  - wide range of fruits and vegetables; assortment of breads, rolls, baguettes; mouth watering baked goods(cakes, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, fruit tarts); deli meats and cheese for sandwiches; floral section; meat and seafood - all at reasonable prices. They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while. The purpose of my visit was to attend the Stonewall Kitchen Jam Tour. They were supposed to be there doing a demo of their products at 12 noon. Instead the lady at the info desk told me it was scheduled for 1PM. Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking. Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."
924,"Just arrived to buy organic semolina pasta, organic mushrooms, and organic beef tenderloin. Aim on cooking stroganov in an hour for Russian night!I'm so tired today... wonder why"
925,"If crowds or parking put you off, come here on a Friday night. You'll practically have the place to yourself. I'm something of a grocery store connoisseur. I love browsing the aisles of food shops wherever I can find them. And when I travel, I almost always bring back edible souvenirs. Visiting Berkeley Bowl West is sort of like going on an exotic trip with the many amazing products they carry. The bulk offerings are truly remarkable. You can find everything from spiced rooibos chai, dried organic persimmons and hibiscus flowers to azuki beans, roasted buckwheat groats and garbanzo flour.My personal favorites are the honey roasted sesame sticks, genmaicha tea and dark chocolate chipotle almonds. I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
926,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."
927,Omg this is a paradise for produceIf your in Berkley it's worth a trip. Just to give you an idea of variety they have 12 varieties of pineapples.
928,"The vast selection of produce at Berkeley Bowl makes it a must stop whenever in the area. I'm always blown away by the mushrooms, local in-season produce, organics and the bargain bins. Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
929,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
930,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
931,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."
932,"This is my absolute favorite Berkeley Bowl! It's such a massive place and with so much produce, how can you go wrong. So much selection to chose from.  Everything in season is always a great pick. Great location as well. ... After the Oregon Berkeley Bowl. Correction, this is my second favorite Berkeley Bowl since I go to the other one more often!"
933,"Overall Berkeley Bowl West is perhaps slightly smaller than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. The bulk section might be slightly smaller here yet the produce section is perhaps bigger than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. Great place to stock up on bulk, produce, & everything else you might need even some products you never knew existed. The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."
934,"Everything you could ever need in the history of ever in the convenience of one giant store. Looking for homeopathic body products? Got it. Just need some Advil? Got it. I love that they have regular grocery store items but also have organic, natural products as well. Amazing!!"
935,"Do you want a S, M, L, or XL avocado today? Do you want strawberries from this farm or that farm? Are you looking for that uncommon produce that will go perfectly with your meal this week? Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal! Don't forget to grab a free cheese sample on your way in/out!"
936,"Berkeley Bowl West is great. This is a big, independent, and popular grocery store located in Southwest Berkeley. The organic produce section is huge and you can buy several foods in bulk. There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics.

This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
958,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
959,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"
960,"Came here on Thursday for the first time, loved it so much I only shopped half the store and left. Brought my girlfriend with me on Friday so we could enjoy this experience together. This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
961,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!
962,"I wish Yelp let you review different aspects of a business, because when it comes to selection and variety, this place is five stars! They have all manner of ingredients, food, and produce. It's a wonderful place to go if you're vegetarian or vegan! Just excellent.But their staff? They must beat them during their breaks or pay them $2 an hour, or perhaps they hire people who affirm their intention of being incredibly rude. A few examples:A cashier rung me up and then just stood there and stared at me. Didn't help me bag my groceries or even offer.Another cashier left her post as I walked up to go outside and pet a small dog who was tied up outside. She left me waiting there at her reigster to pet an animal, and then came back and  handled food I was buying without washing or even sanitizing her hands.Sitting in the cafe', a Berkely Bowl employee sat down at my table, picking his teeth and spacing out. He didn't ask if he could sit there or even if the seat was free, and the place was more than half empty. He could have easily sat at another table.I showed up early on a Sunday, not realizing the store was  not going to open for at least another half an hour. When an empoyee informed me of this, several of the employees setting up the store started laughing at me.And these are just a few examples. I could give many more.Five stars for selection. Zero stars for service. Seriously, if I could give zero stars for their employees I would.I also have some more opinions on the people who work there, but I don't use that kind of language in mixed company."
963,"Date: 6/3/2017  Time: 11:25 AM  63°  Partly sunnyMy first time coming into this store and my reaction?!? Wow...supercalifragilisticexpialidosis!!! I just hope that I spelled the word correct. It is huge...bigly. So big, that it has a cafe across from the store serving breakfast and lunch items. The cafe also has a coffee bar...nice. Definitely I will have to come back to shop and have lunch.I was amazed at what Berkeley Bowl West had to offer  - wide range of fruits and vegetables; assortment of breads, rolls, baguettes; mouth watering baked goods(cakes, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, fruit tarts); deli meats and cheese for sandwiches; floral section; meat and seafood - all at reasonable prices. They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while. The purpose of my visit was to attend the Stonewall Kitchen Jam Tour. They were supposed to be there doing a demo of their products at 12 noon. Instead the lady at the info desk told me it was scheduled for 1PM. Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking. Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."
964,"Just arrived to buy organic semolina pasta, organic mushrooms, and organic beef tenderloin. Aim on cooking stroganov in an hour for Russian night!I'm so tired today... wonder why"
965,"If crowds or parking put you off, come here on a Friday night. You'll practically have the place to yourself. I'm something of a grocery store connoisseur. I love browsing the aisles of food shops wherever I can find them. And when I travel, I almost always bring back edible souvenirs. Visiting Berkeley Bowl West is sort of like going on an exotic trip with the many amazing products they carry. The bulk offerings are truly remarkable. You can find everything from spiced rooibos chai, dried organic persimmons and hibiscus flowers to azuki beans, roasted buckwheat groats and garbanzo flour.My personal favorites are the honey roasted sesame sticks, genmaicha tea and dark chocolate chipotle almonds. I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
966,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."
967,Omg this is a paradise for produceIf your in Berkley it's worth a trip. Just to give you an idea of variety they have 12 varieties of pineapples.
968,"The vast selection of produce at Berkeley Bowl makes it a must stop whenever in the area. I'm always blown away by the mushrooms, local in-season produce, organics and the bargain bins. Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
969,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
970,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
971,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."
972,"This is my absolute favorite Berkeley Bowl! It's such a massive place and with so much produce, how can you go wrong. So much selection to chose from.  Everything in season is always a great pick. Great location as well. ... After the Oregon Berkeley Bowl. Correction, this is my second favorite Berkeley Bowl since I go to the other one more often!"
973,"Overall Berkeley Bowl West is perhaps slightly smaller than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. The bulk section might be slightly smaller here yet the produce section is perhaps bigger than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. Great place to stock up on bulk, produce, & everything else you might need even some products you never knew existed. The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."
974,"Everything you could ever need in the history of ever in the convenience of one giant store. Looking for homeopathic body products? Got it. Just need some Advil? Got it. I love that they have regular grocery store items but also have organic, natural products as well. Amazing!!"
975,"Do you want a S, M, L, or XL avocado today? Do you want strawberries from this farm or that farm? Are you looking for that uncommon produce that will go perfectly with your meal this week? Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal! Don't forget to grab a free cheese sample on your way in/out!"
976,"Berkeley Bowl West is great. This is a big, independent, and popular grocery store located in Southwest Berkeley. The organic produce section is huge and you can buy several foods in bulk. There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics. We got a loaf of bread, rolls, English muffins, blueberry muffins, sliced cantaloupe (1/2), sugar, sour cream, and other cooking ingredients, cartons of organic juice (apple and orange), Berkeley Farms eggnog, ice cream, assorted day-old pastries, and a spectacular fruit tart which we took to a dinner party for dessert. It was a hit.Berkeley Bowl has a nice selection of discounted day-old items from the bakery along with old produce that's still good to eat. It's the biggest I've seen of any grocery store. It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."

This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
1001,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!
1002,"I wish Yelp let you review different aspects of a business, because when it comes to selection and variety, this place is five stars! They have all manner of ingredients, food, and produce. It's a wonderful place to go if you're vegetarian or vegan! Just excellent.But their staff? They must beat them during their breaks or pay them $2 an hour, or perhaps they hire people who affirm their intention of being incredibly rude. A few examples:A cashier rung me up and then just stood there and stared at me. Didn't help me bag my groceries or even offer.Another cashier left her post as I walked up to go outside and pet a small dog who was tied up outside. She left me waiting there at her reigster to pet an animal, and then came back and  handled food I was buying without washing or even sanitizing her hands.Sitting in the cafe', a Berkely Bowl employee sat down at my table, picking his teeth and spacing out. He didn't ask if he could sit there or even if the seat was free, and the place was more than half empty. He could have easily sat at another table.I showed up early on a Sunday, not realizing the store was  not going to open for at least another half an hour. When an empoyee informed me of this, several of the employees setting up the store started laughing at me.And these are just a few examples. I could give many more.Five stars for selection. Zero stars for service. Seriously, if I could give zero stars for their employees I would.I also have some more opinions on the people who work there, but I don't use that kind of language in mixed company."
1003,"Date: 6/3/2017  Time: 11:25 AM  63°  Partly sunnyMy first time coming into this store and my reaction?!? Wow...supercalifragilisticexpialidosis!!! I just hope that I spelled the word correct. It is huge...bigly. So big, that it has a cafe across from the store serving breakfast and lunch items. The cafe also has a coffee bar...nice. Definitely I will have to come back to shop and have lunch.I was amazed at what Berkeley Bowl West had to offer  - wide range of fruits and vegetables; assortment of breads, rolls, baguettes; mouth watering baked goods(cakes, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, fruit tarts); deli meats and cheese for sandwiches; floral section; meat and seafood - all at reasonable prices. They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while. The purpose of my visit was to attend the Stonewall Kitchen Jam Tour. They were supposed to be there doing a demo of their products at 12 noon. Instead the lady at the info desk told me it was scheduled for 1PM. Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking. Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."
1004,"Just arrived to buy organic semolina pasta, organic mushrooms, and organic beef tenderloin. Aim on cooking stroganov in an hour for Russian night!I'm so tired today... wonder why"
1005,"If crowds or parking put you off, come here on a Friday night. You'll practically have the place to yourself. I'm something of a grocery store connoisseur. I love browsing the aisles of food shops wherever I can find them. And when I travel, I almost always bring back edible souvenirs. Visiting Berkeley Bowl West is sort of like going on an exotic trip with the many amazing products they carry. The bulk offerings are truly remarkable. You can find everything from spiced rooibos chai, dried organic persimmons and hibiscus flowers to azuki beans, roasted buckwheat groats and garbanzo flour.My personal favorites are the honey roasted sesame sticks, genmaicha tea and dark chocolate chipotle almonds. I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
1006,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."
1007,Omg this is a paradise for produceIf your in Berkley it's worth a trip. Just to give you an idea of variety they have 12 varieties of pineapples.
1008,"The vast selection of produce at Berkeley Bowl makes it a must stop whenever in the area. I'm always blown away by the mushrooms, local in-season produce, organics and the bargain bins. Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
1009,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
1010,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
1011,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."
1012,"This is my absolute favorite Berkeley Bowl! It's such a massive place and with so much produce, how can you go wrong. So much selection to chose from.  Everything in season is always a great pick. Great location as well. ... After the Oregon Berkeley Bowl. Correction, this is my second favorite Berkeley Bowl since I go to the other one more often!"
1013,"Overall Berkeley Bowl West is perhaps slightly smaller than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. The bulk section might be slightly smaller here yet the produce section is perhaps bigger than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. Great place to stock up on bulk, produce, & everything else you might need even some products you never knew existed. The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."
1014,"Everything you could ever need in the history of ever in the convenience of one giant store. Looking for homeopathic body products? Got it. Just need some Advil? Got it. I love that they have regular grocery store items but also have organic, natural products as well. Amazing!!"
1015,"Do you want a S, M, L, or XL avocado today? Do you want strawberries from this farm or that farm? Are you looking for that uncommon produce that will go perfectly with your meal this week? Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal! Don't forget to grab a free cheese sample on your way in/out!"
1016,"Berkeley Bowl West is great. This is a big, independent, and popular grocery store located in Southwest Berkeley. The organic produce section is huge and you can buy several foods in bulk. There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics. We got a loaf of bread, rolls, English muffins, blueberry muffins, sliced cantaloupe (1/2), sugar, sour cream, and other cooking ingredients, cartons of organic juice (apple and orange), Berkeley Farms eggnog, ice cream, assorted day-old pastries, and a spectacular fruit tart which we took to a dinner party for dessert. It was a hit.Berkeley Bowl has a nice selection of discounted day-old items from the bakery along with old produce that's still good to eat. It's the biggest I've seen of any grocery store. It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."
1017,"Love this place, there is a large variety of healthy fruits, meats, grains, nuts, and most importantly veggies. Priced very fairly and a lot of their groceries are either locally farmed for made. Finally a health food store where packaged food and bottled food products occupy less than half of the space. This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
1018,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
1019,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"

Didn't help me bag my groceries or even offer.Another cashier left her post as I walked up to go outside and pet a small dog who was tied up outside.

Zero stars for service.

1043,"Date: 6/3/2017  Time: 11:25 AM  63°  Partly sunnyMy first time coming into this store and my reaction?!? Wow...supercalifragilisticexpialidosis!!! I just hope that I spelled the word correct. It is huge...bigly. So big, that it has a cafe across from the store serving breakfast and lunch items. The cafe also has a coffee bar...nice. Definitely I will have to come back to shop and have lunch.I was amazed at what Berkeley Bowl West had to offer  - wide range of fruits and vegetables; assortment of breads, rolls, baguettes; mouth watering baked goods(cakes, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, fruit tarts); deli meats and cheese for sandwiches; floral section; meat and seafood - all at reasonable prices. They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while. The purpose of my visit was to attend the Stonewall Kitchen Jam Tour. They were supposed to be there doing a demo of their products at 12 noon. Instead the lady at the info desk told me it was scheduled for 1PM. Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking. Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."
1044,"Just arrived to buy organic semolina pasta, organic mushrooms, and organic beef tenderloin. Aim on cooking stroganov in an hour for Russian night!I'm so tired today... wonder why"
1045,"If crowds or parking put you off, come here on a Friday night. You'll practically have the place to yourself. I'm something of a grocery store connoisseur. I love browsing the aisles of food shops wherever I can find them. And when I travel, I almost always bring back edible souvenirs. Visiting Berkeley Bowl West is sort of like going on an exotic trip with the many amazing products they carry. The bulk offerings are truly remarkable. You can find everything from spiced rooibos chai, dried organic persimmons and hibiscus flowers to azuki beans, roasted buckwheat groats and garbanzo flour.My personal favorites are the honey roasted sesame sticks, genmaicha tea and dark chocolate chipotle almonds. I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
1046,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."
1047,Omg this is a paradise for produceIf your in Berkley it's worth a trip. Just to give you an idea of variety they have 12 varieties of pineapples.
1048,"The vast selection of produce at Berkeley Bowl makes it a must stop whenever in the area. I'm always blown away by the mushrooms, local in-season produce, organics and the bargain bins. Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
1049,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
1050,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
1051,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."
1052,"This is my absolute favorite Berkeley Bowl! It's such a massive place and with so much produce, how can you go wrong. So much selection to chose from.  Everything in season is always a great pick. Great location as well. ... After the Oregon Berkeley Bowl. Correction, this is my second favorite Berkeley Bowl since I go to the other one more often!"
1053,"Overall Berkeley Bowl West is perhaps slightly smaller than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. The bulk section might be slightly smaller here yet the produce section is perhaps bigger than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. Great place to stock up on bulk, produce, & everything else you might need even some products you never knew existed. The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."
1054,"Everything you could ever need in the history of ever in the convenience of one giant store. Looking for homeopathic body products? Got it. Just need some Advil? Got it. I love that they have regular grocery store items but also have organic, natural products as well. Amazing!!"
1055,"Do you want a S, M, L, or XL avocado today? Do you want strawberries from this farm or that farm? Are you looking for that uncommon produce that will go perfectly with your meal this week? Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal! Don't forget to grab a free cheese sample on your way in/out!"
1056,"Berkeley Bowl West is great. This is a big, independent, and popular grocery store located in Southwest Berkeley. The organic produce section is huge and you can buy several foods in bulk. There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics. We got a loaf of bread, rolls, English muffins, blueberry muffins, sliced cantaloupe (1/2), sugar, sour cream, and other cooking ingredients, cartons of organic juice (apple and orange), Berkeley Farms eggnog, ice cream, assorted day-old pastries, and a spectacular fruit tart which we took to a dinner party for dessert. It was a hit.Berkeley Bowl has a nice selection of discounted day-old items from the bakery along with old produce that's still good to eat. It's the biggest I've seen of any grocery store. It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."
1057,"Love this place, there is a large variety of healthy fruits, meats, grains, nuts, and most importantly veggies. Priced very fairly and a lot of their groceries are either locally farmed for made. Finally a health food store where packaged food and bottled food products occupy less than half of the space. This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
1058,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
1059,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"
1060,"Came here on Thursday for the first time, loved it so much I only shopped half the store and left. Brought my girlfriend with me on Friday so we could enjoy this experience together. This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
1061,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!

1083,"Date: 6/3/2017  Time: 11:25 AM  63°  Partly sunnyMy first time coming into this store and my reaction?!? Wow...supercalifragilisticexpialidosis!!! I just hope that I spelled the word correct. It is huge...bigly. So big, that it has a cafe across from the store serving breakfast and lunch items. The cafe also has a coffee bar...nice. Definitely I will have to come back to shop and have lunch.I was amazed at what Berkeley Bowl West had to offer  - wide range of fruits and vegetables; assortment of breads, rolls, baguettes; mouth watering baked goods(cakes, cookies, pastries, doughnuts, fruit tarts); deli meats and cheese for sandwiches; floral section; meat and seafood - all at reasonable prices. They even have an area separate from the store with loads of produce (fruits and veggies) for quick sales at 99¢ a bag. Also at the bargain price of 99¢ were plastic containers of raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. I haven't seen kiwi fruit going for 39¢ each in a good while. The purpose of my visit was to attend the Stonewall Kitchen Jam Tour. They were supposed to be there doing a demo of their products at 12 noon. Instead the lady at the info desk told me it was scheduled for 1PM. Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking. Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."
1084,"Just arrived to buy organic semolina pasta, organic mushrooms, and organic beef tenderloin. Aim on cooking stroganov in an hour for Russian night!I'm so tired today... wonder why"
1085,"If crowds or parking put you off, come here on a Friday night. You'll practically have the place to yourself. I'm something of a grocery store connoisseur. I love browsing the aisles of food shops wherever I can find them. And when I travel, I almost always bring back edible souvenirs. Visiting Berkeley Bowl West is sort of like going on an exotic trip with the many amazing products they carry. The bulk offerings are truly remarkable. You can find everything from spiced rooibos chai, dried organic persimmons and hibiscus flowers to azuki beans, roasted buckwheat groats and garbanzo flour.My personal favorites are the honey roasted sesame sticks, genmaicha tea and dark chocolate chipotle almonds. I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
1086,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."
1087,Omg this is a paradise for produceIf your in Berkley it's worth a trip. Just to give you an idea of variety they have 12 varieties of pineapples.
1088,"The vast selection of produce at Berkeley Bowl makes it a must stop whenever in the area. I'm always blown away by the mushrooms, local in-season produce, organics and the bargain bins. Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
1089,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
1090,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
1091,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."
1092,"This is my absolute favorite Berkeley Bowl! It's such a massive place and with so much produce, how can you go wrong. So much selection to chose from.  Everything in season is always a great pick. Great location as well. ... After the Oregon Berkeley Bowl. Correction, this is my second favorite Berkeley Bowl since I go to the other one more often!"
1093,"Overall Berkeley Bowl West is perhaps slightly smaller than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. The bulk section might be slightly smaller here yet the produce section is perhaps bigger than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. Great place to stock up on bulk, produce, & everything else you might need even some products you never knew existed. The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."
1094,"Everything you could ever need in the history of ever in the convenience of one giant store. Looking for homeopathic body products? Got it. Just need some Advil? Got it. I love that they have regular grocery store items but also have organic, natural products as well. Amazing!!"
1095,"Do you want a S, M, L, or XL avocado today? Do you want strawberries from this farm or that farm? Are you looking for that uncommon produce that will go perfectly with your meal this week? Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal! Don't forget to grab a free cheese sample on your way in/out!"
1096,"Berkeley Bowl West is great. This is a big, independent, and popular grocery store located in Southwest Berkeley. The organic produce section is huge and you can buy several foods in bulk. There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics. We got a loaf of bread, rolls, English muffins, blueberry muffins, sliced cantaloupe (1/2), sugar, sour cream, and other cooking ingredients, cartons of organic juice (apple and orange), Berkeley Farms eggnog, ice cream, assorted day-old pastries, and a spectacular fruit tart which we took to a dinner party for dessert. It was a hit.Berkeley Bowl has a nice selection of discounted day-old items from the bakery along with old produce that's still good to eat. It's the biggest I've seen of any grocery store. It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."
1097,"Love this place, there is a large variety of healthy fruits, meats, grains, nuts, and most importantly veggies. Priced very fairly and a lot of their groceries are either locally farmed for made. Finally a health food store where packaged food and bottled food products occupy less than half of the space. This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
1098,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
1099,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"
1100,"Came here on Thursday for the first time, loved it so much I only shopped half the store and left. Brought my girlfriend with me on Friday so we could enjoy this experience together. This place is mindblowing and makes you think, why weren't you shopping here before? What tops this place off is their terrific produce selections as well as vegan options as well.I will still not get over how much produce they offer with it looking full of all areas of it.I will definitely be back, be ready to wait in line for some time as this is one busy place!"
1101,I came here after a trip to Ikea and I was in love with the abundance of fresh vegetables and fruit. I like that the organic and nonorganic items are organized and labeled well. There are many items that I've never seen in an Asian grocery but are located in this store. They have huge bags of basil for less than $2/lb which is music to my pesto loving ears. There is even a discounted fruits and vegetable room that would be very useful when I make banana bread. Very nice bulk items section as well. Can't wait to come back when I'm in the area!
1102,"I wish Yelp let you review different aspects of a business, because when it comes to selection and variety, this place is five stars! They have all manner of ingredients, food, and produce. It's a wonderful place to go if you're vegetarian or vegan! Just excellent.But their staff? They must beat them during their breaks or pay them $2 an hour, or perhaps they hire people who affirm their intention of being incredibly rude. A few examples:A cashier rung me up and then just stood there and stared at me. Didn't help me bag my groceries or even offer.Another cashier left her post as I walked up to go outside and pet a small dog who was tied up outside. She left me waiting there at her reigster to pet an animal, and then came back and  handled food I was buying without washing or even sanitizing her hands.Sitting in the cafe', a Berkely Bowl employee sat down at my table, picking his teeth and spacing out. He didn't ask if he could sit there or even if the seat was free, and the place was more than half empty. He could have easily sat at another table.I showed up early on a Sunday, not realizing the store was  not going to open for at least another half an hour. When an empoyee informed me of this, several of the employees setting up the store started laughing at me.And these are just a few examples. I could give many more.Five stars for selection.

Unfortunately, I could not wait until 1 PM, as I had another event to attend at 1:30 PM in Oakland at Mosswood Park - Oakland Carnaval with appearances by Samba Funk and other dance troupes.Purchase: a bag of zucchinis for 99¢, a plastic carton of blackberries for $1.69,  3 kiwi fruits for $1.17 and a French cruller for $1.29.Parking lot is across the street with ample parking. Public transportation (AC #72) is within walking distance of about 2 to 3 blocks away on San Pablo Avenue. I love this store. I have to say their prices are more reasonable than Whole Foods. I wish they were closer to Alameda, but it's all good. As I have mentioned above, I will return (with time on hand) to do more browsing and shopping."
1124,"Just arrived to buy organic semolina pasta, organic mushrooms, and organic beef tenderloin. Aim on cooking stroganov in an hour for Russian night!I'm so tired today... wonder why"
1125,"If crowds or parking put you off, come here on a Friday night. You'll practically have the place to yourself. I'm something of a grocery store connoisseur. I love browsing the aisles of food shops wherever I can find them. And when I travel, I almost always bring back edible souvenirs. Visiting Berkeley Bowl West is sort of like going on an exotic trip with the many amazing products they carry. The bulk offerings are truly remarkable. You can find everything from spiced rooibos chai, dried organic persimmons and hibiscus flowers to azuki beans, roasted buckwheat groats and garbanzo flour.My personal favorites are the honey roasted sesame sticks, genmaicha tea and dark chocolate chipotle almonds. I also spend a lot of time in this area of the store when I'm getting ready to bake. They have a great selection of special flours, spices and teas that are worth a closer look.Berkeley Bowl West also has an above average cheese selection, solid wine offerings and a huge amount of both conventional and organically grown produce. You can get a made to order sandwich or burrito here too.After years of shopping at this East Bay institution, I can safely say if you can't find a fruit, vegetable or spice here, it may not exist!"
1126,"If you love to cook, this is a place to go!!No other stores can beat this quality and abundance of fresh produce. Amazing!!Where else can you buy 20 different types of mushrooms?? Great selections for Asian food as well. Little more expensive than Tokyo Fish Market, but worth buying here considering driving farther.Sushi here is awesome! Very fresh. Clam chowder soup is yummy, too. Bargain section of this store is a great buy. Almost going old veggies and fruits for 99 cents a bag. Try avoiding weekends if you can. It gets really crowded."
1127,Omg this is a paradise for produceIf your in Berkley it's worth a trip. Just to give you an idea of variety they have 12 varieties of pineapples.
1128,"The vast selection of produce at Berkeley Bowl makes it a must stop whenever in the area. I'm always blown away by the mushrooms, local in-season produce, organics and the bargain bins. Go way to the back corner to find the bargain produce bins. The bulk section is the most useful for me. Nuts, flax seed powder were this visit's necessary items. Street parking right in front this time...all the parking karma was mine."
1129,"Fresh produce, good variety from natural and typical brands, and fresh meat.   Also the best thing is the bargain produce where you can get vegetables or fruit for like $.99 a bag. this included a bag of cucumbers, potato, mangos, peaches, etc. The variety changes and if you are going to need vegetables or fruit now check the bargain section out b/c its an amazing deal!"
1130,"This is my favorite grocery store ever! Not only do they have a wide variety of produce that is fresh fresh fresh, you will also find things here you can't easily find elsewhere. Organic dandelion greens? Check! Gourmet sauces from Japan? Check! The sweetest organic strawberries without breaking the bank? Check! Local kombucha in cool exciting flavors? Check! Best of all, they have an awesome hot food section where I love to pick up a hot carton of BBQ pork and rice. Delicious, fast and satisfying lunch. Yum!"
1131,"My friend & I eat lunch here at least twice a week due to convenience, but we always leave content, satisfied and eager to try something new. Food: Expansive menu with casual, tasty and fresh lunch options. The offerings on the menu are pretty consistence, but they also have a few seasonal offerings. From simple grilled cheese to more intricate shrimp & avocado salad, they have plenty of guilt-free and gluttonous options. You can also modify and/or substitute various orders.Ambiance: Super casual, huge space with plenty of seating, large windows for your daily dose of Vitamin D. Quick table service and/or to-go. I love that they have a self-serve microwave, ice water and condiments section available for customers. Service: Limited interaction with employees, make sure you bus your own table before heading out.Price: Not the most authentic bites, but considering the quality of the ingredients, portions and location, it's reasonable. Overall: Variety of offerings, this is a great spot for casual lunch dining, studying or grabbing food to-go after shopping at Berkeley Bowl."
1132,"This is my absolute favorite Berkeley Bowl! It's such a massive place and with so much produce, how can you go wrong. So much selection to chose from.  Everything in season is always a great pick. Great location as well. ... After the Oregon Berkeley Bowl. Correction, this is my second favorite Berkeley Bowl since I go to the other one more often!"
1133,"Overall Berkeley Bowl West is perhaps slightly smaller than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. The bulk section might be slightly smaller here yet the produce section is perhaps bigger than Berkeley Bowl on Oregon St. Great place to stock up on bulk, produce, & everything else you might need even some products you never knew existed. The diversity from high priced rare organic speciality foods to more readily available affordable goods is a unique feature about Berkeley Bowl.  One essential improvement would be to move the fermented food such as sauerkraut & kimchi away from the cold cuts as well as the meat section to put it by the tofu or miso products or another section. That was a turn off as vegans or vegetarians also enjoy fermented foods.Either Berkeley Bowl is as good as a natural food store gets & Oakland needs one!I still give Rainbow Grocery in San Francisco the best of the Bay Area honors as it is 100 percent vegetarian & they give you a .05 cent discount for every container you bring to fill up at the bulk bins if you are a package free diet vegan, vegetarian, or homo-sapien. Rainbow Grocery also has 100 percent organic produce while both Berkeley Bowl & Berkeley Bowl West offer the option of organic or conventional produce."
1134,"Everything you could ever need in the history of ever in the convenience of one giant store. Looking for homeopathic body products? Got it. Just need some Advil? Got it. I love that they have regular grocery store items but also have organic, natural products as well. Amazing!!"
1135,"Do you want a S, M, L, or XL avocado today? Do you want strawberries from this farm or that farm? Are you looking for that uncommon produce that will go perfectly with your meal this week? Berkeley Bowl is the place to go!It's the best grocery store I've ever been in and I'm so happy it's close to home. There is so much selection in the produce area! The produce is also generally cheaper than your regular grocery store. The meat here can be a little pricier than your regular grocery store but the quality seems to be much better. Some of the packaged food is also a little pricier here. There is also a great selection of ethnic food here. I can generally find most asian ingredients/food I'm looking for and while it might cost a bit more, it saves me an extra trip to the Korean supermarket or 99 Ranch Market.Parking here is a breeze (unlike the other Berkeley Bowl location. Tried going there once, gave up looking for parking, and came here anyways). There is a parking lot next to the store, underground parking structure, and a parking lot across the street from the store.Even my mom will request we stop by Berkeley Bowl when she comes up to visit from Socal! Don't forget to grab a free cheese sample on your way in/out!"
1136,"Berkeley Bowl West is great. This is a big, independent, and popular grocery store located in Southwest Berkeley. The organic produce section is huge and you can buy several foods in bulk. There's a bakery-cafe serving breakfast and lunch as well as offering delicious made-to-order cakes, a flower shop, a meat counter with butchers and a deli, and a seafood department with fresh and interesting selections. They even sell Japanese housewares, cooking supplies, and various ingredients.You can find a lot of neat and unique stuff such as watermelon gherkins (cucumbers less than the size of grapes that look like watermelons), hard-to-find types of pumpkins and squash, cheryimoyas (custard apples), speckled swan gourds, and kiwanos; grass-fed Wagyu beef, game hen, pheasant, capon (castrated chicken), squab, quail, and ground buffalo, elk and camel; and all sorts of fish and seafood like sushi-grade fish, Nordic gravlax, and sea urchin (uni). Needless to say, it can be entertaining to simply browse the inventory.On my last trip to Oakland to visit family, my sister and I came here and loaded up on a variety of groceries and goodies, though nothing too crazy, just a lot of basics. We got a loaf of bread, rolls, English muffins, blueberry muffins, sliced cantaloupe (1/2), sugar, sour cream, and other cooking ingredients, cartons of organic juice (apple and orange), Berkeley Farms eggnog, ice cream, assorted day-old pastries, and a spectacular fruit tart which we took to a dinner party for dessert. It was a hit.Berkeley Bowl has a nice selection of discounted day-old items from the bakery along with old produce that's still good to eat. It's the biggest I've seen of any grocery store. It's a terrific way to save money on yummy snacks/sweets and organic produce. I ate the day-old pastries for breakfast over the next few days and each one was delicious. One was made with blueberries, another strawberries, and another with sliced almonds. The fruit tart was beautiful, symmetrical in its design and fruit placement. It came with ripe and sweet raspberries, blueberries, mango, kiwi, strawberries, and blackberries. It had a luscious cream filling and a hard appetizing crust.Service is good too.If you've never been to Berkeley Bowl, I recommend you check it out. Berkeley Bowl West is the second location. The original Berkeley Bowl is located a couple miles east in South Berkeley. The grocery stores are called Berkeley Bowl because the first store opened inside what used to be a bowling alley. This location, Berkeley Bowl West, has plenty of free parking, both on street level directly outside the store (in surface lots) and inside an underground garage."
1137,"Love this place, there is a large variety of healthy fruits, meats, grains, nuts, and most importantly veggies. Priced very fairly and a lot of their groceries are either locally farmed for made. Finally a health food store where packaged food and bottled food products occupy less than half of the space. This leaves more room for fruits and veggies. Thank you Berkeley Bowl for giving health conscious folks like us a chance to live and eat healthy and making it affordable. Much love and respect!"
1138,"Charming and earthy store that has a quintessential charm of Berkeley. Perfectly suited for all grocery,snack, fresh fruits and meal needs. I love going by Berkeley Bowl on my way home to pick some groceries and their amazing juices (love mashuana mango, peach smoothie and coconut pineapple juice). Amazing assortment of freshly squeezed juices add to the color and charm of rainbow of vegetables that they carry. IF you go to their cafe do try sweet potato fries actually you can specifically request it. It's the best I've had thus far anywhere. Very crisp and yet super tasty. Their lunch crowd gets overwhelming and service can be dull but i would go back anyday just for their sweetpotato fries."
1139,"Easily one of my favorite markets in SF. It can get a bit crowded sometimes but that isn't surprising given how easy it is to fall in love with this place; huge selection of produce, solid meat and seafood counter, all the bulk food and made foods you could need. And did I mention the reasonable organic or local foods pricing? Highly recommend but it's cool if you don't entirely agree - more Berkeley Bowl for me!"
