0,"Perfect amount of sweetness that's light fluff cakes (if that makes any sense) Seriously one of my favorite places to come when I have a sweet tooth! I love everything they bake here but my favorite has to be the Amaretto, Strawberry cream and the flourless chocolate. Highly recommend coming early because they do tend to run out quick of the good stuff. Pricing is definitely on the high side so if you aren't trying to break the bank on small pieces of cake, you might not want to come because the average slice is over $5."
1,"*Little slice of Hungarian paradise*Apparently this place has been here since 1998. Weird- because I've never noticed it in the neighborhood. Swear my little piggy self noticed & STOPPED by  EVERY sweet shop between my granny's house (insert image of little red riding hood.. except .. I'm clearly brown) and UC Berkeley (back when I took summer classes there Circa '2002ish)WhatevsThis place is so cool. Glad my friend's bf recommended this spot.They have class, culture, cute decorations and the most delicious sweets ever . Not to mention their espresso is pretty decent annnnd they have the most adorable Short coffee cups to go. (Toddler size)So I stopped by around 5:00 & they close at 5:30 on a Tuesday. They were extremely patient and not rushing to clean up- which is nice (hate walking into a store that closes in 1 hour and they're cleaning up).I recommend their almond cream cake which was so dang moist and light as a feather ($5ish). If you like white cake with a slight nut flavor- you'll go for this, and I do mean SLIGHT. It was so good and light I finished the cake on autopilot in 2.2 seconds. Other tasty treats : tiramisu, their seasonal strawberry cake and this awesome looking chocolate cream cakeNotes:- great shaded parking out front - chill location- apparently hecka Hungarians show up on Saturday's which is cool if you identify with that culture - patient staff  - all cakes cost around $5/$5.50"
2,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while particularly for their Amaretti cake, Tiramisu, and Boston Creme pies. HoweverI've never been able to make it here during the weekdays since they close at 5:30, so I decided to test my luck coming here on a Saturday at around 2PM (they close at 4).Much like what others have echoed, definitely come here early because the assortment you can chose from dwindles down. Luckily there were still a few slices of the Amaretti cake, but I think the other things I came to try were already sold out. They also have a few items in a separate display case by the register away from the cake display so be sure to check those items out. LOCATION: Right on Shattuck there is some street parking near this location but I think it's easier to walk from BART or bus to. They have seating inside for those who want coffee and even a few tables outside that they also bus.FOOD: $5 a slice is pricey for me, but one time for the one time right. The Amaretti cake was definitely worth the walk and I'm not a huge cake fan! The cake was moist, the cream light/airy, and overall sweet but not too sweet. The added cookies on top made for a great change in texture and sweetness to the cake. Even though I finished a slice myself, I didn't feel like I got cavities while doing so (well I hope not. haha). SERVICE: I only came here to get a cake to-go so I can't really comment on the sentiments of other Yelpers about the service. The service was friendly and greeted me right when I walked through the door, but to be honest I did feel a little rushed even though there was nobody behind me. Luckily I already knew what I wanted but I can only imagine how it would be if you had no idea. CONS: I couldn't give it 5 stars for these reasons - Hours - Limited assortment later in the day"
3,"Soft, delectable, moist cakes, the ~$5 slices of cakes here are totally worth a trip! Many Yelpers have mentioned that the ladies here aren't so friendly and that the cakes do sell out as the day goes on, so be sure to come earlier and check their website to see what delicious baked goods they're selling each day. I also found the ladies here to be pretty friendly! Anyways, the cake. I got:1) Tiramisu (5/5) - Definitely one of the best tiramisu I've enjoyed. The cake itself is so moist, and majorly soaked in coffee, contributing to the overall softness of this cake. The cream is whipped to perfect smoothness, and the flavor of this cake is absolutely delicious. Though the slice isn't that big for ~$5, I would say it's such a rich (though not heavy) dessert that the slice is a good size!2) Amaretti (5/5) - I think I love this cake more than the tiramisu. I love the vanilla flavor, smoooooth cream, soft moist fluffy cake, and the added crunch of the crushed crackers on top.  I'll definitely be back to try more things!"
4,The tiramisu with dark chocolate mousse is to.die.for.
5,"I've been coming here for years but keep forgetting to leave a review. As an undergrad I would go dessert hopping whenever I wanted to treat myself and hit up a bunch of bakeries and gorge (La Farine, Crixa, and Katrina Rozelle). Berkeley is not lacking in homey cake shops but I feel like each one has their own speciality, so it really depends on your mood.Crixa has a modest menu and a distinctive Eastern European influence (they sell pierogies and kifli!). I've tried almost all their standard cakes and their crowning glory has to be their tiramisu. The sponge cake is always perfectly moist and rich with espresso flavors, while the mascarpone is airy, light, and never too sweet. I'm partial to their Soprano version which is made with a layer of their smoky dark chocolate. I also recently tried their vanilla bizet, which is like a pavlova, all ethereal and Christmas white. The meringue base was firm yet dissolved into perfect flaky sweetness once I bit into it and the vanilla cream was exquisite and again, not too sweet. Truly a local's delight and one that I hope continue to flourish in Berkeley for years to come!"
6,"Crixa is both great and terrible. Great because of their food and coffee, terrible because of their hours and...while not terrible, the ladies behind the counter are always brusque and don't have any time for your shit. Get it together, this is a business.Crixa is totally open during the week when no one buys cake at 2 PM on a Thursday, but not on Sundays. So go on a Saturday. But do go early, because they will run out of stuff and they won't be sorry about it. They'll tell you that you should've come earlier. The bizet and ginger cake are two of our favorites, and their coffee is quite good. The coffee is pricey, but you're also shelling out $4.50 for a pastry, so go big or go home.They do have limited outdoor seating, but beware if it's sunny outside--the tables are metal and will burn your skin off. The good: delicious pastries.The bad: hours could be better."
7,"This place has the best baked goods in the Bay Area, possibly the North American continent, and maybe the world (outside of France)! Yeah, I love them! Forget tartine, or any of the other bakeries, they can't compare. I drive 2.5 hours, 2-3 times a month to get their cakes. One of my favorite things about it is that the cakes are sooo good, and the guys there are true to their Hungarian roots :) reserved and professional without any of the fake American friendliness! Win-win- I don't have to fake smile, I just get to honestly smile at them because I am glad to see them and their wonderful cakes! Btw, it would be six stars, if it were an option."
8,"Soooooo rude. Both women didn't say a single word to me. I asked for what I wanted and the lady rang up my order and just said the total while the other boxed up the dessert. The lady at the register turned the screen toward me to sign the screen. After I signed my signature she handed me my card and I said ""Thank you"".  In a low voice she said ""thank you"". If I didn't say anything she wouldn't have said anything to me. There was no greeting, or can I help you, nothing from either of the two. They seemed like they were miserable and I must have been bothering them. Why would anyone want to pay someone to treat them like that? 1st and last time ever going there. Beware if you want to be treated like a paying customer that is appreciated and supporting their business. If it doesn't matter to you then stop by for the slim pickings of variety."
9,"You know how good this place is? So good I couldn't wait to write a review. I seriously took 2 bites out of my tiramisu cake and 2 from my coconut cake and just HAD to write it right now [with my cake beside me.] I am in heaven.Coconut cake: Nice and moist with just the right amount of coconut! It does not have an overwhelming amount of coconut flavor or cream. I am definitely a fan.Tiramisu: Perfection! It's not often you come across great tiramisu so I was just blown away at the perfection of Crixa's. It is perfectly moist and the filling was on point with the right amount of expresso flavor. I am definitely a fan of this place as I'm sure you can tell. I was pretty shocked to see all my coworkers getting seconds as well! Typically for any sweets, I don't see many grabbing seconds. This time I saw them grabbing seconds and debating what to get as their third!  Where have you guys been in my life!"
10,"Amazing cakes, awful service. What a bummer because this place otherwise deserves 5 stars without a doubt.Came here to pick up my Dad's bday cake that my sister pre-ordered and paid over the phone. When I walked into the store, the employee looked at me with a very unamused look. I told her that I was here to pick up a cake, and showed her the receipt that my sister said they instructed us to do. She responded, ""Just tell me the name."" very bluntly with a rude untertone.After, I asked her for a bag and explained that I had to walk to the BART station and then take the train home. It was Friday, so I knew the trains would be busy. She told flattly told me they were $0.30, and when I asked if I could pay with card, she said no then quickly put it away. I then had to hold the cake very still on my hour and a half commute from the store. Afterwards, I told my sister my experience and she confirmed that they were a piece of work on the phone too.However, once we finally dug into the cake, I gotta admit it was AMAZING! We got the Amaretti, and wow. The cake itself was very fluffy and moist. The cream was devine! And the little bits on top, not exactly sure what they were, but they gave it a perfect yet slight crunch.All in all, I'm just kind of surprised with Crixa's. Why wouldn't you treat customers kindly? As someone that has worked as a server, I understand that food may be good but customer service is what makes people loyal - it goes hand and hand! Crixa's is delicious, but don't come here if you're expecting the full experience that includes both delicious food and amazing service. I would honestly rather spend my money at a place that would happily do both, considering this small cake was $28."
11,"After walking up to Summer Kitchen and Bake Shop but finding out their pastry chef had left so they had no cookies, cakes, etc. I headed towards the next Berkeley bakery on my list - Crixa.  Honestly, I was a bit unsure exactly what a Russian bakery would be like but turns out its pretty much like any other bakery :)  The amaretto cake was as good as the other reviewers suggest and it almost melts in your mouth.  I also tried the apple cake (with whipped cream on the side) and that was pretty good, but not as sweet as I would have liked (though the cashier warned me about that upfront).  Overall, a great experience and I was particularly surprised/delighted by how many different types of cakes, pies, and tarts they have - at least a dozen or so different flavors (though many of them were sold out by the time I got there)."
12,My favorite dessert place within walking distance! Love their flourless chocolate cake
13,"A couple of my friends have raved about this bakery and I can see why!The cakes, though a bit pricey, are worth every dollar. The cakes I have tried have all been moist and delicious. It really annoys me when frosting on cakes is too sweet, and Crixa nails the sugar ratio. My favorite cake here has to be the jamaican rum chocolate mousse cake. This cake is absolutely delicious. The rum isn't lost in the baking, as the cake is soaked, making for a really delicious cake."
14,I lived in Germany for many years and travelled through Central Europe. Crixa sort of ruined it for me because I thought I'd had the best Central European pastries around. After going to crixa I returned to Central Europe and dined in the finest coffeehouses where all the great cultural people did their culture and i felt a deep sorrow. How can crixa be the best? Berkeley continues its food domination. I hope this place doesn't get too popular because it's like the secret came out.
15,"Nice little coffee shop. Clean with a welcoming, funky decor. Very friendly and helpful staff. Fair prices.Good espresso. Loved the tres leches cake. Great place to get a slice of cake and a good cup of coffee."
16,"Best sour cherry pie I've ever had- looking forward to a return visit next week.Decor is reminiscent of a European cafe, quaint and charming."
17,"The flourless chocolate cake and poppy seed rugelah are not to be missed. The cake, in particular, was beautifully chocolatey with a lovely light texture. We also tried the ginger round, which was fine, but nothing to write home about. Loved the other two items and will be back for a slice of the pear and rose cream tarte!"
18,"I had heard about this place and from the Yelp reviews was really looking forward to a Boston Cream cake.  Alas, we arrived on a Saturday after 2pm and there wasn't much selection at all.  I selected a slice of the Florio cake, as the almond/raspberry combo sounded good to me but I was a little skeptical about the rose flavored creme, as I generally don't like flowery flavors (teas, etc).I must admit I was pleasantly surprised and I really enjoyed this cake.  The flavors and textures blended very nicely- creamy, crunchy, the rose flavor very subtle.  Definitely a quality cake but a bit of a splurge ($5.45/slice).  Not something I'd buy every day for that price but you get what you pay for!  Can't wait to try the Boston Creme next time, I'll have to get there in the morning!"
19,"I have enjoyed both cakes and pies from Crixa. All products I have tried were excellent. The ingredients were fresh , moist and well prepared.It has become my go to bakery. Accordingly I would recommend this bakery as one of the best in the Bay areao"

Many Yelpers have mentioned that the ladies here aren't so friendly and that the cakes do sell out as the day goes on, so be sure to come earlier and check their website to see what delicious baked goods they're selling each day. I also found the ladies here to be pretty friendly! Anyways, the cake. I got:1) Tiramisu (5/5) - Definitely one of the best tiramisu I've enjoyed. The cake itself is so moist, and majorly soaked in coffee, contributing to the overall softness of this cake. The cream is whipped to perfect smoothness, and the flavor of this cake is absolutely delicious. Though the slice isn't that big for ~$5, I would say it's such a rich (though not heavy) dessert that the slice is a good size!2) Amaretti (5/5) - I think I love this cake more than the tiramisu. I love the vanilla flavor, smoooooth cream, soft moist fluffy cake, and the added crunch of the crushed crackers on top.  I'll definitely be back to try more things!"
44,The tiramisu with dark chocolate mousse is to.die.for.
45,"I've been coming here for years but keep forgetting to leave a review. As an undergrad I would go dessert hopping whenever I wanted to treat myself and hit up a bunch of bakeries and gorge (La Farine, Crixa, and Katrina Rozelle). Berkeley is not lacking in homey cake shops but I feel like each one has their own speciality, so it really depends on your mood.Crixa has a modest menu and a distinctive Eastern European influence (they sell pierogies and kifli!). I've tried almost all their standard cakes and their crowning glory has to be their tiramisu. The sponge cake is always perfectly moist and rich with espresso flavors, while the mascarpone is airy, light, and never too sweet. I'm partial to their Soprano version which is made with a layer of their smoky dark chocolate. I also recently tried their vanilla bizet, which is like a pavlova, all ethereal and Christmas white. The meringue base was firm yet dissolved into perfect flaky sweetness once I bit into it and the vanilla cream was exquisite and again, not too sweet. Truly a local's delight and one that I hope continue to flourish in Berkeley for years to come!"
46,"Crixa is both great and terrible. Great because of their food and coffee, terrible because of their hours and...while not terrible, the ladies behind the counter are always brusque and don't have any time for your shit. Get it together, this is a business.Crixa is totally open during the week when no one buys cake at 2 PM on a Thursday, but not on Sundays. So go on a Saturday. But do go early, because they will run out of stuff and they won't be sorry about it. They'll tell you that you should've come earlier. The bizet and ginger cake are two of our favorites, and their coffee is quite good. The coffee is pricey, but you're also shelling out $4.50 for a pastry, so go big or go home.They do have limited outdoor seating, but beware if it's sunny outside--the tables are metal and will burn your skin off. The good: delicious pastries.The bad: hours could be better."
47,"This place has the best baked goods in the Bay Area, possibly the North American continent, and maybe the world (outside of France)! Yeah, I love them! Forget tartine, or any of the other bakeries, they can't compare. I drive 2.5 hours, 2-3 times a month to get their cakes. One of my favorite things about it is that the cakes are sooo good, and the guys there are true to their Hungarian roots :) reserved and professional without any of the fake American friendliness! Win-win- I don't have to fake smile, I just get to honestly smile at them because I am glad to see them and their wonderful cakes! Btw, it would be six stars, if it were an option."
48,"Soooooo rude. Both women didn't say a single word to me. I asked for what I wanted and the lady rang up my order and just said the total while the other boxed up the dessert. The lady at the register turned the screen toward me to sign the screen. After I signed my signature she handed me my card and I said ""Thank you"".  In a low voice she said ""thank you"". If I didn't say anything she wouldn't have said anything to me. There was no greeting, or can I help you, nothing from either of the two. They seemed like they were miserable and I must have been bothering them. Why would anyone want to pay someone to treat them like that? 1st and last time ever going there. Beware if you want to be treated like a paying customer that is appreciated and supporting their business. If it doesn't matter to you then stop by for the slim pickings of variety."
49,"You know how good this place is? So good I couldn't wait to write a review. I seriously took 2 bites out of my tiramisu cake and 2 from my coconut cake and just HAD to write it right now [with my cake beside me.] I am in heaven.Coconut cake: Nice and moist with just the right amount of coconut! It does not have an overwhelming amount of coconut flavor or cream. I am definitely a fan.Tiramisu: Perfection! It's not often you come across great tiramisu so I was just blown away at the perfection of Crixa's. It is perfectly moist and the filling was on point with the right amount of expresso flavor. I am definitely a fan of this place as I'm sure you can tell. I was pretty shocked to see all my coworkers getting seconds as well! Typically for any sweets, I don't see many grabbing seconds. This time I saw them grabbing seconds and debating what to get as their third!  Where have you guys been in my life!"
50,"Amazing cakes, awful service. What a bummer because this place otherwise deserves 5 stars without a doubt.Came here to pick up my Dad's bday cake that my sister pre-ordered and paid over the phone. When I walked into the store, the employee looked at me with a very unamused look. I told her that I was here to pick up a cake, and showed her the receipt that my sister said they instructed us to do. She responded, ""Just tell me the name."" very bluntly with a rude untertone.After, I asked her for a bag and explained that I had to walk to the BART station and then take the train home. It was Friday, so I knew the trains would be busy. She told flattly told me they were $0.30, and when I asked if I could pay with card, she said no then quickly put it away. I then had to hold the cake very still on my hour and a half commute from the store. Afterwards, I told my sister my experience and she confirmed that they were a piece of work on the phone too.However, once we finally dug into the cake, I gotta admit it was AMAZING! We got the Amaretti, and wow. The cake itself was very fluffy and moist. The cream was devine! And the little bits on top, not exactly sure what they were, but they gave it a perfect yet slight crunch.All in all, I'm just kind of surprised with Crixa's. Why wouldn't you treat customers kindly? As someone that has worked as a server, I understand that food may be good but customer service is what makes people loyal - it goes hand and hand! Crixa's is delicious, but don't come here if you're expecting the full experience that includes both delicious food and amazing service. I would honestly rather spend my money at a place that would happily do both, considering this small cake was $28."
51,"After walking up to Summer Kitchen and Bake Shop but finding out their pastry chef had left so they had no cookies, cakes, etc. I headed towards the next Berkeley bakery on my list - Crixa.  Honestly, I was a bit unsure exactly what a Russian bakery would be like but turns out its pretty much like any other bakery :)  The amaretto cake was as good as the other reviewers suggest and it almost melts in your mouth.  I also tried the apple cake (with whipped cream on the side) and that was pretty good, but not as sweet as I would have liked (though the cashier warned me about that upfront).  Overall, a great experience and I was particularly surprised/delighted by how many different types of cakes, pies, and tarts they have - at least a dozen or so different flavors (though many of them were sold out by the time I got there)."
52,My favorite dessert place within walking distance! Love their flourless chocolate cake
53,"A couple of my friends have raved about this bakery and I can see why!The cakes, though a bit pricey, are worth every dollar. The cakes I have tried have all been moist and delicious. It really annoys me when frosting on cakes is too sweet, and Crixa nails the sugar ratio. My favorite cake here has to be the jamaican rum chocolate mousse cake. This cake is absolutely delicious. The rum isn't lost in the baking, as the cake is soaked, making for a really delicious cake."
54,I lived in Germany for many years and travelled through Central Europe. Crixa sort of ruined it for me because I thought I'd had the best Central European pastries around. After going to crixa I returned to Central Europe and dined in the finest coffeehouses where all the great cultural people did their culture and i felt a deep sorrow. How can crixa be the best? Berkeley continues its food domination. I hope this place doesn't get too popular because it's like the secret came out.
55,"Nice little coffee shop. Clean with a welcoming, funky decor. Very friendly and helpful staff. Fair prices.Good espresso. Loved the tres leches cake. Great place to get a slice of cake and a good cup of coffee."
56,"Best sour cherry pie I've ever had- looking forward to a return visit next week.Decor is reminiscent of a European cafe, quaint and charming."
57,"The flourless chocolate cake and poppy seed rugelah are not to be missed. The cake, in particular, was beautifully chocolatey with a lovely light texture. We also tried the ginger round, which was fine, but nothing to write home about. Loved the other two items and will be back for a slice of the pear and rose cream tarte!"
58,"I had heard about this place and from the Yelp reviews was really looking forward to a Boston Cream cake.  Alas, we arrived on a Saturday after 2pm and there wasn't much selection at all.  I selected a slice of the Florio cake, as the almond/raspberry combo sounded good to me but I was a little skeptical about the rose flavored creme, as I generally don't like flowery flavors (teas, etc).I must admit I was pleasantly surprised and I really enjoyed this cake.  The flavors and textures blended very nicely- creamy, crunchy, the rose flavor very subtle.  Definitely a quality cake but a bit of a splurge ($5.45/slice).  Not something I'd buy every day for that price but you get what you pay for!  Can't wait to try the Boston Creme next time, I'll have to get there in the morning!"
59,"I have enjoyed both cakes and pies from Crixa. All products I have tried were excellent. The ingredients were fresh , moist and well prepared.It has become my go to bakery. Accordingly I would recommend this bakery as one of the best in the Bay areao"
60,"Perfect amount of sweetness that's light fluff cakes (if that makes any sense) Seriously one of my favorite places to come when I have a sweet tooth! I love everything they bake here but my favorite has to be the Amaretto, Strawberry cream and the flourless chocolate. Highly recommend coming early because they do tend to run out quick of the good stuff. Pricing is definitely on the high side so if you aren't trying to break the bank on small pieces of cake, you might not want to come because the average slice is over $5."
61,"*Little slice of Hungarian paradise*Apparently this place has been here since 1998. Weird- because I've never noticed it in the neighborhood. Swear my little piggy self noticed & STOPPED by  EVERY sweet shop between my granny's house (insert image of little red riding hood.. except .. I'm clearly brown) and UC Berkeley (back when I took summer classes there Circa '2002ish)WhatevsThis place is so cool. Glad my friend's bf recommended this spot.They have class, culture, cute decorations and the most delicious sweets ever . Not to mention their espresso is pretty decent annnnd they have the most adorable Short coffee cups to go. (Toddler size)So I stopped by around 5:00 & they close at 5:30 on a Tuesday. They were extremely patient and not rushing to clean up- which is nice (hate walking into a store that closes in 1 hour and they're cleaning up).I recommend their almond cream cake which was so dang moist and light as a feather ($5ish). If you like white cake with a slight nut flavor- you'll go for this, and I do mean SLIGHT. It was so good and light I finished the cake on autopilot in 2.2 seconds. Other tasty treats : tiramisu, their seasonal strawberry cake and this awesome looking chocolate cream cakeNotes:- great shaded parking out front - chill location- apparently hecka Hungarians show up on Saturday's which is cool if you identify with that culture - patient staff  - all cakes cost around $5/$5.50"
62,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while particularly for their Amaretti cake, Tiramisu, and Boston Creme pies. HoweverI've never been able to make it here during the weekdays since they close at 5:30, so I decided to test my luck coming here on a Saturday at around 2PM (they close at 4).Much like what others have echoed, definitely come here early because the assortment you can chose from dwindles down. Luckily there were still a few slices of the Amaretti cake, but I think the other things I came to try were already sold out. They also have a few items in a separate display case by the register away from the cake display so be sure to check those items out. LOCATION: Right on Shattuck there is some street parking near this location but I think it's easier to walk from BART or bus to. They have seating inside for those who want coffee and even a few tables outside that they also bus.FOOD: $5 a slice is pricey for me, but one time for the one time right. The Amaretti cake was definitely worth the walk and I'm not a huge cake fan! The cake was moist, the cream light/airy, and overall sweet but not too sweet. The added cookies on top made for a great change in texture and sweetness to the cake. Even though I finished a slice myself, I didn't feel like I got cavities while doing so (well I hope not. haha). SERVICE: I only came here to get a cake to-go so I can't really comment on the sentiments of other Yelpers about the service. The service was friendly and greeted me right when I walked through the door, but to be honest I did feel a little rushed even though there was nobody behind me.

Win-win- I don't have to fake smile, I just get to honestly smile at them because I am glad to see them and their wonderful cakes! Btw, it would be six stars, if it were an option."
88,"Soooooo rude. Both women didn't say a single word to me. I asked for what I wanted and the lady rang up my order and just said the total while the other boxed up the dessert. The lady at the register turned the screen toward me to sign the screen. After I signed my signature she handed me my card and I said ""Thank you"".  In a low voice she said ""thank you"". If I didn't say anything she wouldn't have said anything to me. There was no greeting, or can I help you, nothing from either of the two. They seemed like they were miserable and I must have been bothering them. Why would anyone want to pay someone to treat them like that? 1st and last time ever going there. Beware if you want to be treated like a paying customer that is appreciated and supporting their business. If it doesn't matter to you then stop by for the slim pickings of variety."
89,"You know how good this place is? So good I couldn't wait to write a review. I seriously took 2 bites out of my tiramisu cake and 2 from my coconut cake and just HAD to write it right now [with my cake beside me.] I am in heaven.Coconut cake: Nice and moist with just the right amount of coconut! It does not have an overwhelming amount of coconut flavor or cream. I am definitely a fan.Tiramisu: Perfection! It's not often you come across great tiramisu so I was just blown away at the perfection of Crixa's. It is perfectly moist and the filling was on point with the right amount of expresso flavor. I am definitely a fan of this place as I'm sure you can tell. I was pretty shocked to see all my coworkers getting seconds as well! Typically for any sweets, I don't see many grabbing seconds. This time I saw them grabbing seconds and debating what to get as their third!  Where have you guys been in my life!"
90,"Amazing cakes, awful service. What a bummer because this place otherwise deserves 5 stars without a doubt.Came here to pick up my Dad's bday cake that my sister pre-ordered and paid over the phone. When I walked into the store, the employee looked at me with a very unamused look. I told her that I was here to pick up a cake, and showed her the receipt that my sister said they instructed us to do. She responded, ""Just tell me the name."" very bluntly with a rude untertone.After, I asked her for a bag and explained that I had to walk to the BART station and then take the train home. It was Friday, so I knew the trains would be busy. She told flattly told me they were $0.30, and when I asked if I could pay with card, she said no then quickly put it away. I then had to hold the cake very still on my hour and a half commute from the store. Afterwards, I told my sister my experience and she confirmed that they were a piece of work on the phone too.However, once we finally dug into the cake, I gotta admit it was AMAZING! We got the Amaretti, and wow. The cake itself was very fluffy and moist. The cream was devine! And the little bits on top, not exactly sure what they were, but they gave it a perfect yet slight crunch.All in all, I'm just kind of surprised with Crixa's. Why wouldn't you treat customers kindly? As someone that has worked as a server, I understand that food may be good but customer service is what makes people loyal - it goes hand and hand! Crixa's is delicious, but don't come here if you're expecting the full experience that includes both delicious food and amazing service. I would honestly rather spend my money at a place that would happily do both, considering this small cake was $28."
91,"After walking up to Summer Kitchen and Bake Shop but finding out their pastry chef had left so they had no cookies, cakes, etc. I headed towards the next Berkeley bakery on my list - Crixa.  Honestly, I was a bit unsure exactly what a Russian bakery would be like but turns out its pretty much like any other bakery :)  The amaretto cake was as good as the other reviewers suggest and it almost melts in your mouth.  I also tried the apple cake (with whipped cream on the side) and that was pretty good, but not as sweet as I would have liked (though the cashier warned me about that upfront).  Overall, a great experience and I was particularly surprised/delighted by how many different types of cakes, pies, and tarts they have - at least a dozen or so different flavors (though many of them were sold out by the time I got there)."
92,My favorite dessert place within walking distance! Love their flourless chocolate cake
93,"A couple of my friends have raved about this bakery and I can see why!The cakes, though a bit pricey, are worth every dollar. The cakes I have tried have all been moist and delicious. It really annoys me when frosting on cakes is too sweet, and Crixa nails the sugar ratio. My favorite cake here has to be the jamaican rum chocolate mousse cake. This cake is absolutely delicious. The rum isn't lost in the baking, as the cake is soaked, making for a really delicious cake."
94,I lived in Germany for many years and travelled through Central Europe. Crixa sort of ruined it for me because I thought I'd had the best Central European pastries around. After going to crixa I returned to Central Europe and dined in the finest coffeehouses where all the great cultural people did their culture and i felt a deep sorrow. How can crixa be the best? Berkeley continues its food domination. I hope this place doesn't get too popular because it's like the secret came out.
95,"Nice little coffee shop. Clean with a welcoming, funky decor. Very friendly and helpful staff. Fair prices.Good espresso. Loved the tres leches cake. Great place to get a slice of cake and a good cup of coffee."
96,"Best sour cherry pie I've ever had- looking forward to a return visit next week.Decor is reminiscent of a European cafe, quaint and charming."
97,"The flourless chocolate cake and poppy seed rugelah are not to be missed. The cake, in particular, was beautifully chocolatey with a lovely light texture. We also tried the ginger round, which was fine, but nothing to write home about. Loved the other two items and will be back for a slice of the pear and rose cream tarte!"
98,"I had heard about this place and from the Yelp reviews was really looking forward to a Boston Cream cake.  Alas, we arrived on a Saturday after 2pm and there wasn't much selection at all.  I selected a slice of the Florio cake, as the almond/raspberry combo sounded good to me but I was a little skeptical about the rose flavored creme, as I generally don't like flowery flavors (teas, etc).I must admit I was pleasantly surprised and I really enjoyed this cake.  The flavors and textures blended very nicely- creamy, crunchy, the rose flavor very subtle.  Definitely a quality cake but a bit of a splurge ($5.45/slice).  Not something I'd buy every day for that price but you get what you pay for!  Can't wait to try the Boston Creme next time, I'll have to get there in the morning!"
99,"I have enjoyed both cakes and pies from Crixa. All products I have tried were excellent. The ingredients were fresh , moist and well prepared.It has become my go to bakery. Accordingly I would recommend this bakery as one of the best in the Bay areao"
100,"Perfect amount of sweetness that's light fluff cakes (if that makes any sense) Seriously one of my favorite places to come when I have a sweet tooth! I love everything they bake here but my favorite has to be the Amaretto, Strawberry cream and the flourless chocolate. Highly recommend coming early because they do tend to run out quick of the good stuff. Pricing is definitely on the high side so if you aren't trying to break the bank on small pieces of cake, you might not want to come because the average slice is over $5."
101,"*Little slice of Hungarian paradise*Apparently this place has been here since 1998. Weird- because I've never noticed it in the neighborhood. Swear my little piggy self noticed & STOPPED by  EVERY sweet shop between my granny's house (insert image of little red riding hood.. except .. I'm clearly brown) and UC Berkeley (back when I took summer classes there Circa '2002ish)WhatevsThis place is so cool. Glad my friend's bf recommended this spot.They have class, culture, cute decorations and the most delicious sweets ever . Not to mention their espresso is pretty decent annnnd they have the most adorable Short coffee cups to go. (Toddler size)So I stopped by around 5:00 & they close at 5:30 on a Tuesday. They were extremely patient and not rushing to clean up- which is nice (hate walking into a store that closes in 1 hour and they're cleaning up).I recommend their almond cream cake which was so dang moist and light as a feather ($5ish). If you like white cake with a slight nut flavor- you'll go for this, and I do mean SLIGHT. It was so good and light I finished the cake on autopilot in 2.2 seconds. Other tasty treats : tiramisu, their seasonal strawberry cake and this awesome looking chocolate cream cakeNotes:- great shaded parking out front - chill location- apparently hecka Hungarians show up on Saturday's which is cool if you identify with that culture - patient staff  - all cakes cost around $5/$5.50"
102,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while particularly for their Amaretti cake, Tiramisu, and Boston Creme pies. HoweverI've never been able to make it here during the weekdays since they close at 5:30, so I decided to test my luck coming here on a Saturday at around 2PM (they close at 4).Much like what others have echoed, definitely come here early because the assortment you can chose from dwindles down. Luckily there were still a few slices of the Amaretti cake, but I think the other things I came to try were already sold out. They also have a few items in a separate display case by the register away from the cake display so be sure to check those items out. LOCATION: Right on Shattuck there is some street parking near this location but I think it's easier to walk from BART or bus to. They have seating inside for those who want coffee and even a few tables outside that they also bus.FOOD: $5 a slice is pricey for me, but one time for the one time right. The Amaretti cake was definitely worth the walk and I'm not a huge cake fan! The cake was moist, the cream light/airy, and overall sweet but not too sweet. The added cookies on top made for a great change in texture and sweetness to the cake. Even though I finished a slice myself, I didn't feel like I got cavities while doing so (well I hope not. haha). SERVICE: I only came here to get a cake to-go so I can't really comment on the sentiments of other Yelpers about the service. The service was friendly and greeted me right when I walked through the door, but to be honest I did feel a little rushed even though there was nobody behind me. Luckily I already knew what I wanted but I can only imagine how it would be if you had no idea. CONS: I couldn't give it 5 stars for these reasons - Hours - Limited assortment later in the day"
103,"Soft, delectable, moist cakes, the ~$5 slices of cakes here are totally worth a trip! Many Yelpers have mentioned that the ladies here aren't so friendly and that the cakes do sell out as the day goes on, so be sure to come earlier and check their website to see what delicious baked goods they're selling each day. I also found the ladies here to be pretty friendly! Anyways, the cake. I got:1) Tiramisu (5/5) - Definitely one of the best tiramisu I've enjoyed. The cake itself is so moist, and majorly soaked in coffee, contributing to the overall softness of this cake. The cream is whipped to perfect smoothness, and the flavor of this cake is absolutely delicious. Though the slice isn't that big for ~$5, I would say it's such a rich (though not heavy) dessert that the slice is a good size!2) Amaretti (5/5) - I think I love this cake more than the tiramisu. I love the vanilla flavor, smoooooth cream, soft moist fluffy cake, and the added crunch of the crushed crackers on top.  I'll definitely be back to try more things!"
104,The tiramisu with dark chocolate mousse is to.die.for.
105,"I've been coming here for years but keep forgetting to leave a review. As an undergrad I would go dessert hopping whenever I wanted to treat myself and hit up a bunch of bakeries and gorge (La Farine, Crixa, and Katrina Rozelle). Berkeley is not lacking in homey cake shops but I feel like each one has their own speciality, so it really depends on your mood.Crixa has a modest menu and a distinctive Eastern European influence (they sell pierogies and kifli!). I've tried almost all their standard cakes and their crowning glory has to be their tiramisu. The sponge cake is always perfectly moist and rich with espresso flavors, while the mascarpone is airy, light, and never too sweet. I'm partial to their Soprano version which is made with a layer of their smoky dark chocolate. I also recently tried their vanilla bizet, which is like a pavlova, all ethereal and Christmas white. The meringue base was firm yet dissolved into perfect flaky sweetness once I bit into it and the vanilla cream was exquisite and again, not too sweet. Truly a local's delight and one that I hope continue to flourish in Berkeley for years to come!"
106,"Crixa is both great and terrible. Great because of their food and coffee, terrible because of their hours and...while not terrible, the ladies behind the counter are always brusque and don't have any time for your shit. Get it together, this is a business.Crixa is totally open during the week when no one buys cake at 2 PM on a Thursday, but not on Sundays. So go on a Saturday. But do go early, because they will run out of stuff and they won't be sorry about it. They'll tell you that you should've come earlier. The bizet and ginger cake are two of our favorites, and their coffee is quite good. The coffee is pricey, but you're also shelling out $4.50 for a pastry, so go big or go home.They do have limited outdoor seating, but beware if it's sunny outside--the tables are metal and will burn your skin off. The good: delicious pastries.The bad: hours could be better."
107,"This place has the best baked goods in the Bay Area, possibly the North American continent, and maybe the world (outside of France)! Yeah, I love them!

Crixa's is delicious, but don't come here if you're expecting the full experience that includes both delicious food and amazing service. I would honestly rather spend my money at a place that would happily do both, considering this small cake was $28."
131,"After walking up to Summer Kitchen and Bake Shop but finding out their pastry chef had left so they had no cookies, cakes, etc. I headed towards the next Berkeley bakery on my list - Crixa.  Honestly, I was a bit unsure exactly what a Russian bakery would be like but turns out its pretty much like any other bakery :)  The amaretto cake was as good as the other reviewers suggest and it almost melts in your mouth.  I also tried the apple cake (with whipped cream on the side) and that was pretty good, but not as sweet as I would have liked (though the cashier warned me about that upfront).  Overall, a great experience and I was particularly surprised/delighted by how many different types of cakes, pies, and tarts they have - at least a dozen or so different flavors (though many of them were sold out by the time I got there)."
132,My favorite dessert place within walking distance! Love their flourless chocolate cake
133,"A couple of my friends have raved about this bakery and I can see why!The cakes, though a bit pricey, are worth every dollar. The cakes I have tried have all been moist and delicious. It really annoys me when frosting on cakes is too sweet, and Crixa nails the sugar ratio. My favorite cake here has to be the jamaican rum chocolate mousse cake. This cake is absolutely delicious. The rum isn't lost in the baking, as the cake is soaked, making for a really delicious cake."
134,I lived in Germany for many years and travelled through Central Europe. Crixa sort of ruined it for me because I thought I'd had the best Central European pastries around. After going to crixa I returned to Central Europe and dined in the finest coffeehouses where all the great cultural people did their culture and i felt a deep sorrow. How can crixa be the best? Berkeley continues its food domination. I hope this place doesn't get too popular because it's like the secret came out.
135,"Nice little coffee shop. Clean with a welcoming, funky decor. Very friendly and helpful staff. Fair prices.Good espresso. Loved the tres leches cake. Great place to get a slice of cake and a good cup of coffee."
136,"Best sour cherry pie I've ever had- looking forward to a return visit next week.Decor is reminiscent of a European cafe, quaint and charming."
137,"The flourless chocolate cake and poppy seed rugelah are not to be missed. The cake, in particular, was beautifully chocolatey with a lovely light texture. We also tried the ginger round, which was fine, but nothing to write home about. Loved the other two items and will be back for a slice of the pear and rose cream tarte!"
138,"I had heard about this place and from the Yelp reviews was really looking forward to a Boston Cream cake.  Alas, we arrived on a Saturday after 2pm and there wasn't much selection at all.  I selected a slice of the Florio cake, as the almond/raspberry combo sounded good to me but I was a little skeptical about the rose flavored creme, as I generally don't like flowery flavors (teas, etc).I must admit I was pleasantly surprised and I really enjoyed this cake.  The flavors and textures blended very nicely- creamy, crunchy, the rose flavor very subtle.  Definitely a quality cake but a bit of a splurge ($5.45/slice).  Not something I'd buy every day for that price but you get what you pay for!  Can't wait to try the Boston Creme next time, I'll have to get there in the morning!"
139,"I have enjoyed both cakes and pies from Crixa. All products I have tried were excellent. The ingredients were fresh , moist and well prepared.It has become my go to bakery. Accordingly I would recommend this bakery as one of the best in the Bay areao"
140,"Perfect amount of sweetness that's light fluff cakes (if that makes any sense) Seriously one of my favorite places to come when I have a sweet tooth! I love everything they bake here but my favorite has to be the Amaretto, Strawberry cream and the flourless chocolate. Highly recommend coming early because they do tend to run out quick of the good stuff. Pricing is definitely on the high side so if you aren't trying to break the bank on small pieces of cake, you might not want to come because the average slice is over $5."
141,"*Little slice of Hungarian paradise*Apparently this place has been here since 1998. Weird- because I've never noticed it in the neighborhood. Swear my little piggy self noticed & STOPPED by  EVERY sweet shop between my granny's house (insert image of little red riding hood.. except .. I'm clearly brown) and UC Berkeley (back when I took summer classes there Circa '2002ish)WhatevsThis place is so cool. Glad my friend's bf recommended this spot.They have class, culture, cute decorations and the most delicious sweets ever . Not to mention their espresso is pretty decent annnnd they have the most adorable Short coffee cups to go. (Toddler size)So I stopped by around 5:00 & they close at 5:30 on a Tuesday. They were extremely patient and not rushing to clean up- which is nice (hate walking into a store that closes in 1 hour and they're cleaning up).I recommend their almond cream cake which was so dang moist and light as a feather ($5ish). If you like white cake with a slight nut flavor- you'll go for this, and I do mean SLIGHT. It was so good and light I finished the cake on autopilot in 2.2 seconds. Other tasty treats : tiramisu, their seasonal strawberry cake and this awesome looking chocolate cream cakeNotes:- great shaded parking out front - chill location- apparently hecka Hungarians show up on Saturday's which is cool if you identify with that culture - patient staff  - all cakes cost around $5/$5.50"
142,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while particularly for their Amaretti cake, Tiramisu, and Boston Creme pies. HoweverI've never been able to make it here during the weekdays since they close at 5:30, so I decided to test my luck coming here on a Saturday at around 2PM (they close at 4).Much like what others have echoed, definitely come here early because the assortment you can chose from dwindles down. Luckily there were still a few slices of the Amaretti cake, but I think the other things I came to try were already sold out. They also have a few items in a separate display case by the register away from the cake display so be sure to check those items out. LOCATION: Right on Shattuck there is some street parking near this location but I think it's easier to walk from BART or bus to. They have seating inside for those who want coffee and even a few tables outside that they also bus.FOOD: $5 a slice is pricey for me, but one time for the one time right. The Amaretti cake was definitely worth the walk and I'm not a huge cake fan! The cake was moist, the cream light/airy, and overall sweet but not too sweet. The added cookies on top made for a great change in texture and sweetness to the cake. Even though I finished a slice myself, I didn't feel like I got cavities while doing so (well I hope not. haha). SERVICE: I only came here to get a cake to-go so I can't really comment on the sentiments of other Yelpers about the service. The service was friendly and greeted me right when I walked through the door, but to be honest I did feel a little rushed even though there was nobody behind me. Luckily I already knew what I wanted but I can only imagine how it would be if you had no idea. CONS: I couldn't give it 5 stars for these reasons - Hours - Limited assortment later in the day"
143,"Soft, delectable, moist cakes, the ~$5 slices of cakes here are totally worth a trip! Many Yelpers have mentioned that the ladies here aren't so friendly and that the cakes do sell out as the day goes on, so be sure to come earlier and check their website to see what delicious baked goods they're selling each day. I also found the ladies here to be pretty friendly! Anyways, the cake. I got:1) Tiramisu (5/5) - Definitely one of the best tiramisu I've enjoyed. The cake itself is so moist, and majorly soaked in coffee, contributing to the overall softness of this cake. The cream is whipped to perfect smoothness, and the flavor of this cake is absolutely delicious. Though the slice isn't that big for ~$5, I would say it's such a rich (though not heavy) dessert that the slice is a good size!2) Amaretti (5/5) - I think I love this cake more than the tiramisu. I love the vanilla flavor, smoooooth cream, soft moist fluffy cake, and the added crunch of the crushed crackers on top.  I'll definitely be back to try more things!"
144,The tiramisu with dark chocolate mousse is to.die.for.
145,"I've been coming here for years but keep forgetting to leave a review. As an undergrad I would go dessert hopping whenever I wanted to treat myself and hit up a bunch of bakeries and gorge (La Farine, Crixa, and Katrina Rozelle). Berkeley is not lacking in homey cake shops but I feel like each one has their own speciality, so it really depends on your mood.Crixa has a modest menu and a distinctive Eastern European influence (they sell pierogies and kifli!). I've tried almost all their standard cakes and their crowning glory has to be their tiramisu. The sponge cake is always perfectly moist and rich with espresso flavors, while the mascarpone is airy, light, and never too sweet. I'm partial to their Soprano version which is made with a layer of their smoky dark chocolate. I also recently tried their vanilla bizet, which is like a pavlova, all ethereal and Christmas white. The meringue base was firm yet dissolved into perfect flaky sweetness once I bit into it and the vanilla cream was exquisite and again, not too sweet. Truly a local's delight and one that I hope continue to flourish in Berkeley for years to come!"
146,"Crixa is both great and terrible. Great because of their food and coffee, terrible because of their hours and...while not terrible, the ladies behind the counter are always brusque and don't have any time for your shit. Get it together, this is a business.Crixa is totally open during the week when no one buys cake at 2 PM on a Thursday, but not on Sundays. So go on a Saturday. But do go early, because they will run out of stuff and they won't be sorry about it. They'll tell you that you should've come earlier. The bizet and ginger cake are two of our favorites, and their coffee is quite good. The coffee is pricey, but you're also shelling out $4.50 for a pastry, so go big or go home.They do have limited outdoor seating, but beware if it's sunny outside--the tables are metal and will burn your skin off. The good: delicious pastries.The bad: hours could be better."
147,"This place has the best baked goods in the Bay Area, possibly the North American continent, and maybe the world (outside of France)! Yeah, I love them! Forget tartine, or any of the other bakeries, they can't compare. I drive 2.5 hours, 2-3 times a month to get their cakes. One of my favorite things about it is that the cakes are sooo good, and the guys there are true to their Hungarian roots :) reserved and professional without any of the fake American friendliness! Win-win- I don't have to fake smile, I just get to honestly smile at them because I am glad to see them and their wonderful cakes! Btw, it would be six stars, if it were an option."
148,"Soooooo rude. Both women didn't say a single word to me. I asked for what I wanted and the lady rang up my order and just said the total while the other boxed up the dessert. The lady at the register turned the screen toward me to sign the screen. After I signed my signature she handed me my card and I said ""Thank you"".  In a low voice she said ""thank you"". If I didn't say anything she wouldn't have said anything to me. There was no greeting, or can I help you, nothing from either of the two. They seemed like they were miserable and I must have been bothering them. Why would anyone want to pay someone to treat them like that? 1st and last time ever going there. Beware if you want to be treated like a paying customer that is appreciated and supporting their business. If it doesn't matter to you then stop by for the slim pickings of variety."
149,"You know how good this place is? So good I couldn't wait to write a review. I seriously took 2 bites out of my tiramisu cake and 2 from my coconut cake and just HAD to write it right now [with my cake beside me.] I am in heaven.Coconut cake: Nice and moist with just the right amount of coconut! It does not have an overwhelming amount of coconut flavor or cream. I am definitely a fan.Tiramisu: Perfection! It's not often you come across great tiramisu so I was just blown away at the perfection of Crixa's. It is perfectly moist and the filling was on point with the right amount of expresso flavor. I am definitely a fan of this place as I'm sure you can tell. I was pretty shocked to see all my coworkers getting seconds as well! Typically for any sweets, I don't see many grabbing seconds. This time I saw them grabbing seconds and debating what to get as their third!  Where have you guys been in my life!"
150,"Amazing cakes, awful service. What a bummer because this place otherwise deserves 5 stars without a doubt.Came here to pick up my Dad's bday cake that my sister pre-ordered and paid over the phone. When I walked into the store, the employee looked at me with a very unamused look. I told her that I was here to pick up a cake, and showed her the receipt that my sister said they instructed us to do. She responded, ""Just tell me the name."" very bluntly with a rude untertone.After, I asked her for a bag and explained that I had to walk to the BART station and then take the train home. It was Friday, so I knew the trains would be busy. She told flattly told me they were $0.30, and when I asked if I could pay with card, she said no then quickly put it away. I then had to hold the cake very still on my hour and a half commute from the store. Afterwards, I told my sister my experience and she confirmed that they were a piece of work on the phone too.However, once we finally dug into the cake, I gotta admit it was AMAZING! We got the Amaretti, and wow. The cake itself was very fluffy and moist. The cream was devine! And the little bits on top, not exactly sure what they were, but they gave it a perfect yet slight crunch.All in all, I'm just kind of surprised with Crixa's. Why wouldn't you treat customers kindly?

178,"I had heard about this place and from the Yelp reviews was really looking forward to a Boston Cream cake.  Alas, we arrived on a Saturday after 2pm and there wasn't much selection at all.  I selected a slice of the Florio cake, as the almond/raspberry combo sounded good to me but I was a little skeptical about the rose flavored creme, as I generally don't like flowery flavors (teas, etc).I must admit I was pleasantly surprised and I really enjoyed this cake.  The flavors and textures blended very nicely- creamy, crunchy, the rose flavor very subtle.  Definitely a quality cake but a bit of a splurge ($5.45/slice).  Not something I'd buy every day for that price but you get what you pay for!  Can't wait to try the Boston Creme next time, I'll have to get there in the morning!"
179,"I have enjoyed both cakes and pies from Crixa. All products I have tried were excellent. The ingredients were fresh , moist and well prepared.It has become my go to bakery. Accordingly I would recommend this bakery as one of the best in the Bay areao"
180,"Perfect amount of sweetness that's light fluff cakes (if that makes any sense) Seriously one of my favorite places to come when I have a sweet tooth! I love everything they bake here but my favorite has to be the Amaretto, Strawberry cream and the flourless chocolate. Highly recommend coming early because they do tend to run out quick of the good stuff. Pricing is definitely on the high side so if you aren't trying to break the bank on small pieces of cake, you might not want to come because the average slice is over $5."
181,"*Little slice of Hungarian paradise*Apparently this place has been here since 1998. Weird- because I've never noticed it in the neighborhood. Swear my little piggy self noticed & STOPPED by  EVERY sweet shop between my granny's house (insert image of little red riding hood.. except .. I'm clearly brown) and UC Berkeley (back when I took summer classes there Circa '2002ish)WhatevsThis place is so cool. Glad my friend's bf recommended this spot.They have class, culture, cute decorations and the most delicious sweets ever . Not to mention their espresso is pretty decent annnnd they have the most adorable Short coffee cups to go. (Toddler size)So I stopped by around 5:00 & they close at 5:30 on a Tuesday. They were extremely patient and not rushing to clean up- which is nice (hate walking into a store that closes in 1 hour and they're cleaning up).I recommend their almond cream cake which was so dang moist and light as a feather ($5ish). If you like white cake with a slight nut flavor- you'll go for this, and I do mean SLIGHT. It was so good and light I finished the cake on autopilot in 2.2 seconds. Other tasty treats : tiramisu, their seasonal strawberry cake and this awesome looking chocolate cream cakeNotes:- great shaded parking out front - chill location- apparently hecka Hungarians show up on Saturday's which is cool if you identify with that culture - patient staff  - all cakes cost around $5/$5.50"
182,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while particularly for their Amaretti cake, Tiramisu, and Boston Creme pies. HoweverI've never been able to make it here during the weekdays since they close at 5:30, so I decided to test my luck coming here on a Saturday at around 2PM (they close at 4).Much like what others have echoed, definitely come here early because the assortment you can chose from dwindles down. Luckily there were still a few slices of the Amaretti cake, but I think the other things I came to try were already sold out. They also have a few items in a separate display case by the register away from the cake display so be sure to check those items out. LOCATION: Right on Shattuck there is some street parking near this location but I think it's easier to walk from BART or bus to. They have seating inside for those who want coffee and even a few tables outside that they also bus.FOOD: $5 a slice is pricey for me, but one time for the one time right. The Amaretti cake was definitely worth the walk and I'm not a huge cake fan! The cake was moist, the cream light/airy, and overall sweet but not too sweet. The added cookies on top made for a great change in texture and sweetness to the cake. Even though I finished a slice myself, I didn't feel like I got cavities while doing so (well I hope not. haha). SERVICE: I only came here to get a cake to-go so I can't really comment on the sentiments of other Yelpers about the service. The service was friendly and greeted me right when I walked through the door, but to be honest I did feel a little rushed even though there was nobody behind me. Luckily I already knew what I wanted but I can only imagine how it would be if you had no idea. CONS: I couldn't give it 5 stars for these reasons - Hours - Limited assortment later in the day"
183,"Soft, delectable, moist cakes, the ~$5 slices of cakes here are totally worth a trip! Many Yelpers have mentioned that the ladies here aren't so friendly and that the cakes do sell out as the day goes on, so be sure to come earlier and check their website to see what delicious baked goods they're selling each day. I also found the ladies here to be pretty friendly! Anyways, the cake. I got:1) Tiramisu (5/5) - Definitely one of the best tiramisu I've enjoyed. The cake itself is so moist, and majorly soaked in coffee, contributing to the overall softness of this cake. The cream is whipped to perfect smoothness, and the flavor of this cake is absolutely delicious. Though the slice isn't that big for ~$5, I would say it's such a rich (though not heavy) dessert that the slice is a good size!2) Amaretti (5/5) - I think I love this cake more than the tiramisu. I love the vanilla flavor, smoooooth cream, soft moist fluffy cake, and the added crunch of the crushed crackers on top.  I'll definitely be back to try more things!"
184,The tiramisu with dark chocolate mousse is to.die.for.
185,"I've been coming here for years but keep forgetting to leave a review. As an undergrad I would go dessert hopping whenever I wanted to treat myself and hit up a bunch of bakeries and gorge (La Farine, Crixa, and Katrina Rozelle). Berkeley is not lacking in homey cake shops but I feel like each one has their own speciality, so it really depends on your mood.Crixa has a modest menu and a distinctive Eastern European influence (they sell pierogies and kifli!). I've tried almost all their standard cakes and their crowning glory has to be their tiramisu. The sponge cake is always perfectly moist and rich with espresso flavors, while the mascarpone is airy, light, and never too sweet. I'm partial to their Soprano version which is made with a layer of their smoky dark chocolate. I also recently tried their vanilla bizet, which is like a pavlova, all ethereal and Christmas white. The meringue base was firm yet dissolved into perfect flaky sweetness once I bit into it and the vanilla cream was exquisite and again, not too sweet. Truly a local's delight and one that I hope continue to flourish in Berkeley for years to come!"
186,"Crixa is both great and terrible. Great because of their food and coffee, terrible because of their hours and...while not terrible, the ladies behind the counter are always brusque and don't have any time for your shit. Get it together, this is a business.Crixa is totally open during the week when no one buys cake at 2 PM on a Thursday, but not on Sundays. So go on a Saturday. But do go early, because they will run out of stuff and they won't be sorry about it. They'll tell you that you should've come earlier. The bizet and ginger cake are two of our favorites, and their coffee is quite good. The coffee is pricey, but you're also shelling out $4.50 for a pastry, so go big or go home.They do have limited outdoor seating, but beware if it's sunny outside--the tables are metal and will burn your skin off. The good: delicious pastries.The bad: hours could be better."
187,"This place has the best baked goods in the Bay Area, possibly the North American continent, and maybe the world (outside of France)! Yeah, I love them! Forget tartine, or any of the other bakeries, they can't compare. I drive 2.5 hours, 2-3 times a month to get their cakes. One of my favorite things about it is that the cakes are sooo good, and the guys there are true to their Hungarian roots :) reserved and professional without any of the fake American friendliness! Win-win- I don't have to fake smile, I just get to honestly smile at them because I am glad to see them and their wonderful cakes! Btw, it would be six stars, if it were an option."
188,"Soooooo rude. Both women didn't say a single word to me. I asked for what I wanted and the lady rang up my order and just said the total while the other boxed up the dessert. The lady at the register turned the screen toward me to sign the screen. After I signed my signature she handed me my card and I said ""Thank you"".  In a low voice she said ""thank you"". If I didn't say anything she wouldn't have said anything to me. There was no greeting, or can I help you, nothing from either of the two. They seemed like they were miserable and I must have been bothering them. Why would anyone want to pay someone to treat them like that? 1st and last time ever going there. Beware if you want to be treated like a paying customer that is appreciated and supporting their business. If it doesn't matter to you then stop by for the slim pickings of variety."
189,"You know how good this place is? So good I couldn't wait to write a review. I seriously took 2 bites out of my tiramisu cake and 2 from my coconut cake and just HAD to write it right now [with my cake beside me.] I am in heaven.Coconut cake: Nice and moist with just the right amount of coconut! It does not have an overwhelming amount of coconut flavor or cream. I am definitely a fan.Tiramisu: Perfection! It's not often you come across great tiramisu so I was just blown away at the perfection of Crixa's. It is perfectly moist and the filling was on point with the right amount of expresso flavor. I am definitely a fan of this place as I'm sure you can tell. I was pretty shocked to see all my coworkers getting seconds as well! Typically for any sweets, I don't see many grabbing seconds. This time I saw them grabbing seconds and debating what to get as their third!  Where have you guys been in my life!"
190,"Amazing cakes, awful service. What a bummer because this place otherwise deserves 5 stars without a doubt.Came here to pick up my Dad's bday cake that my sister pre-ordered and paid over the phone. When I walked into the store, the employee looked at me with a very unamused look. I told her that I was here to pick up a cake, and showed her the receipt that my sister said they instructed us to do. She responded, ""Just tell me the name."" very bluntly with a rude untertone.After, I asked her for a bag and explained that I had to walk to the BART station and then take the train home. It was Friday, so I knew the trains would be busy. She told flattly told me they were $0.30, and when I asked if I could pay with card, she said no then quickly put it away. I then had to hold the cake very still on my hour and a half commute from the store. Afterwards, I told my sister my experience and she confirmed that they were a piece of work on the phone too.However, once we finally dug into the cake, I gotta admit it was AMAZING! We got the Amaretti, and wow. The cake itself was very fluffy and moist. The cream was devine! And the little bits on top, not exactly sure what they were, but they gave it a perfect yet slight crunch.All in all, I'm just kind of surprised with Crixa's. Why wouldn't you treat customers kindly? As someone that has worked as a server, I understand that food may be good but customer service is what makes people loyal - it goes hand and hand! Crixa's is delicious, but don't come here if you're expecting the full experience that includes both delicious food and amazing service. I would honestly rather spend my money at a place that would happily do both, considering this small cake was $28."
191,"After walking up to Summer Kitchen and Bake Shop but finding out their pastry chef had left so they had no cookies, cakes, etc. I headed towards the next Berkeley bakery on my list - Crixa.  Honestly, I was a bit unsure exactly what a Russian bakery would be like but turns out its pretty much like any other bakery :)  The amaretto cake was as good as the other reviewers suggest and it almost melts in your mouth.  I also tried the apple cake (with whipped cream on the side) and that was pretty good, but not as sweet as I would have liked (though the cashier warned me about that upfront).  Overall, a great experience and I was particularly surprised/delighted by how many different types of cakes, pies, and tarts they have - at least a dozen or so different flavors (though many of them were sold out by the time I got there)."
192,My favorite dessert place within walking distance! Love their flourless chocolate cake
193,"A couple of my friends have raved about this bakery and I can see why!The cakes, though a bit pricey, are worth every dollar. The cakes I have tried have all been moist and delicious. It really annoys me when frosting on cakes is too sweet, and Crixa nails the sugar ratio. My favorite cake here has to be the jamaican rum chocolate mousse cake. This cake is absolutely delicious. The rum isn't lost in the baking, as the cake is soaked, making for a really delicious cake."
194,I lived in Germany for many years and travelled through Central Europe. Crixa sort of ruined it for me because I thought I'd had the best Central European pastries around. After going to crixa I returned to Central Europe and dined in the finest coffeehouses where all the great cultural people did their culture and i felt a deep sorrow. How can crixa be the best? Berkeley continues its food domination. I hope this place doesn't get too popular because it's like the secret came out.
195,"Nice little coffee shop. Clean with a welcoming, funky decor. Very friendly and helpful staff. Fair prices.Good espresso. Loved the tres leches cake. Great place to get a slice of cake and a good cup of coffee."

Luckily there were still a few slices of the Amaretti cake, but I think the other things I came to try were already sold out. They also have a few items in a separate display case by the register away from the cake display so be sure to check those items out. LOCATION: Right on Shattuck there is some street parking near this location but I think it's easier to walk from BART or bus to. They have seating inside for those who want coffee and even a few tables outside that they also bus.FOOD: $5 a slice is pricey for me, but one time for the one time right. The Amaretti cake was definitely worth the walk and I'm not a huge cake fan! The cake was moist, the cream light/airy, and overall sweet but not too sweet. The added cookies on top made for a great change in texture and sweetness to the cake. Even though I finished a slice myself, I didn't feel like I got cavities while doing so (well I hope not. haha). SERVICE: I only came here to get a cake to-go so I can't really comment on the sentiments of other Yelpers about the service. The service was friendly and greeted me right when I walked through the door, but to be honest I did feel a little rushed even though there was nobody behind me. Luckily I already knew what I wanted but I can only imagine how it would be if you had no idea. CONS: I couldn't give it 5 stars for these reasons - Hours - Limited assortment later in the day"
223,"Soft, delectable, moist cakes, the ~$5 slices of cakes here are totally worth a trip! Many Yelpers have mentioned that the ladies here aren't so friendly and that the cakes do sell out as the day goes on, so be sure to come earlier and check their website to see what delicious baked goods they're selling each day. I also found the ladies here to be pretty friendly! Anyways, the cake. I got:1) Tiramisu (5/5) - Definitely one of the best tiramisu I've enjoyed. The cake itself is so moist, and majorly soaked in coffee, contributing to the overall softness of this cake. The cream is whipped to perfect smoothness, and the flavor of this cake is absolutely delicious. Though the slice isn't that big for ~$5, I would say it's such a rich (though not heavy) dessert that the slice is a good size!2) Amaretti (5/5) - I think I love this cake more than the tiramisu. I love the vanilla flavor, smoooooth cream, soft moist fluffy cake, and the added crunch of the crushed crackers on top.  I'll definitely be back to try more things!"
224,The tiramisu with dark chocolate mousse is to.die.for.
225,"I've been coming here for years but keep forgetting to leave a review. As an undergrad I would go dessert hopping whenever I wanted to treat myself and hit up a bunch of bakeries and gorge (La Farine, Crixa, and Katrina Rozelle). Berkeley is not lacking in homey cake shops but I feel like each one has their own speciality, so it really depends on your mood.Crixa has a modest menu and a distinctive Eastern European influence (they sell pierogies and kifli!). I've tried almost all their standard cakes and their crowning glory has to be their tiramisu. The sponge cake is always perfectly moist and rich with espresso flavors, while the mascarpone is airy, light, and never too sweet. I'm partial to their Soprano version which is made with a layer of their smoky dark chocolate. I also recently tried their vanilla bizet, which is like a pavlova, all ethereal and Christmas white. The meringue base was firm yet dissolved into perfect flaky sweetness once I bit into it and the vanilla cream was exquisite and again, not too sweet. Truly a local's delight and one that I hope continue to flourish in Berkeley for years to come!"
226,"Crixa is both great and terrible. Great because of their food and coffee, terrible because of their hours and...while not terrible, the ladies behind the counter are always brusque and don't have any time for your shit. Get it together, this is a business.Crixa is totally open during the week when no one buys cake at 2 PM on a Thursday, but not on Sundays. So go on a Saturday. But do go early, because they will run out of stuff and they won't be sorry about it. They'll tell you that you should've come earlier. The bizet and ginger cake are two of our favorites, and their coffee is quite good. The coffee is pricey, but you're also shelling out $4.50 for a pastry, so go big or go home.They do have limited outdoor seating, but beware if it's sunny outside--the tables are metal and will burn your skin off. The good: delicious pastries.The bad: hours could be better."
227,"This place has the best baked goods in the Bay Area, possibly the North American continent, and maybe the world (outside of France)! Yeah, I love them! Forget tartine, or any of the other bakeries, they can't compare. I drive 2.5 hours, 2-3 times a month to get their cakes. One of my favorite things about it is that the cakes are sooo good, and the guys there are true to their Hungarian roots :) reserved and professional without any of the fake American friendliness! Win-win- I don't have to fake smile, I just get to honestly smile at them because I am glad to see them and their wonderful cakes! Btw, it would be six stars, if it were an option."
228,"Soooooo rude. Both women didn't say a single word to me. I asked for what I wanted and the lady rang up my order and just said the total while the other boxed up the dessert. The lady at the register turned the screen toward me to sign the screen. After I signed my signature she handed me my card and I said ""Thank you"".  In a low voice she said ""thank you"". If I didn't say anything she wouldn't have said anything to me. There was no greeting, or can I help you, nothing from either of the two. They seemed like they were miserable and I must have been bothering them. Why would anyone want to pay someone to treat them like that? 1st and last time ever going there. Beware if you want to be treated like a paying customer that is appreciated and supporting their business. If it doesn't matter to you then stop by for the slim pickings of variety."
229,"You know how good this place is? So good I couldn't wait to write a review. I seriously took 2 bites out of my tiramisu cake and 2 from my coconut cake and just HAD to write it right now [with my cake beside me.] I am in heaven.Coconut cake: Nice and moist with just the right amount of coconut! It does not have an overwhelming amount of coconut flavor or cream. I am definitely a fan.Tiramisu: Perfection! It's not often you come across great tiramisu so I was just blown away at the perfection of Crixa's. It is perfectly moist and the filling was on point with the right amount of expresso flavor. I am definitely a fan of this place as I'm sure you can tell. I was pretty shocked to see all my coworkers getting seconds as well! Typically for any sweets, I don't see many grabbing seconds. This time I saw them grabbing seconds and debating what to get as their third!  Where have you guys been in my life!"
230,"Amazing cakes, awful service. What a bummer because this place otherwise deserves 5 stars without a doubt.Came here to pick up my Dad's bday cake that my sister pre-ordered and paid over the phone. When I walked into the store, the employee looked at me with a very unamused look. I told her that I was here to pick up a cake, and showed her the receipt that my sister said they instructed us to do. She responded, ""Just tell me the name."" very bluntly with a rude untertone.After, I asked her for a bag and explained that I had to walk to the BART station and then take the train home. It was Friday, so I knew the trains would be busy. She told flattly told me they were $0.30, and when I asked if I could pay with card, she said no then quickly put it away. I then had to hold the cake very still on my hour and a half commute from the store. Afterwards, I told my sister my experience and she confirmed that they were a piece of work on the phone too.However, once we finally dug into the cake, I gotta admit it was AMAZING! We got the Amaretti, and wow. The cake itself was very fluffy and moist. The cream was devine! And the little bits on top, not exactly sure what they were, but they gave it a perfect yet slight crunch.All in all, I'm just kind of surprised with Crixa's. Why wouldn't you treat customers kindly? As someone that has worked as a server, I understand that food may be good but customer service is what makes people loyal - it goes hand and hand! Crixa's is delicious, but don't come here if you're expecting the full experience that includes both delicious food and amazing service. I would honestly rather spend my money at a place that would happily do both, considering this small cake was $28."
231,"After walking up to Summer Kitchen and Bake Shop but finding out their pastry chef had left so they had no cookies, cakes, etc. I headed towards the next Berkeley bakery on my list - Crixa.  Honestly, I was a bit unsure exactly what a Russian bakery would be like but turns out its pretty much like any other bakery :)  The amaretto cake was as good as the other reviewers suggest and it almost melts in your mouth.  I also tried the apple cake (with whipped cream on the side) and that was pretty good, but not as sweet as I would have liked (though the cashier warned me about that upfront).  Overall, a great experience and I was particularly surprised/delighted by how many different types of cakes, pies, and tarts they have - at least a dozen or so different flavors (though many of them were sold out by the time I got there)."
232,My favorite dessert place within walking distance! Love their flourless chocolate cake
233,"A couple of my friends have raved about this bakery and I can see why!The cakes, though a bit pricey, are worth every dollar. The cakes I have tried have all been moist and delicious. It really annoys me when frosting on cakes is too sweet, and Crixa nails the sugar ratio. My favorite cake here has to be the jamaican rum chocolate mousse cake. This cake is absolutely delicious. The rum isn't lost in the baking, as the cake is soaked, making for a really delicious cake."
234,I lived in Germany for many years and travelled through Central Europe. Crixa sort of ruined it for me because I thought I'd had the best Central European pastries around. After going to crixa I returned to Central Europe and dined in the finest coffeehouses where all the great cultural people did their culture and i felt a deep sorrow. How can crixa be the best? Berkeley continues its food domination. I hope this place doesn't get too popular because it's like the secret came out.
235,"Nice little coffee shop. Clean with a welcoming, funky decor. Very friendly and helpful staff. Fair prices.Good espresso. Loved the tres leches cake. Great place to get a slice of cake and a good cup of coffee."
236,"Best sour cherry pie I've ever had- looking forward to a return visit next week.Decor is reminiscent of a European cafe, quaint and charming."
237,"The flourless chocolate cake and poppy seed rugelah are not to be missed. The cake, in particular, was beautifully chocolatey with a lovely light texture. We also tried the ginger round, which was fine, but nothing to write home about. Loved the other two items and will be back for a slice of the pear and rose cream tarte!"
238,"I had heard about this place and from the Yelp reviews was really looking forward to a Boston Cream cake.  Alas, we arrived on a Saturday after 2pm and there wasn't much selection at all.  I selected a slice of the Florio cake, as the almond/raspberry combo sounded good to me but I was a little skeptical about the rose flavored creme, as I generally don't like flowery flavors (teas, etc).I must admit I was pleasantly surprised and I really enjoyed this cake.  The flavors and textures blended very nicely- creamy, crunchy, the rose flavor very subtle.  Definitely a quality cake but a bit of a splurge ($5.45/slice).  Not something I'd buy every day for that price but you get what you pay for!  Can't wait to try the Boston Creme next time, I'll have to get there in the morning!"
239,"I have enjoyed both cakes and pies from Crixa. All products I have tried were excellent. The ingredients were fresh , moist and well prepared.It has become my go to bakery. Accordingly I would recommend this bakery as one of the best in the Bay areao"
240,"Perfect amount of sweetness that's light fluff cakes (if that makes any sense) Seriously one of my favorite places to come when I have a sweet tooth! I love everything they bake here but my favorite has to be the Amaretto, Strawberry cream and the flourless chocolate. Highly recommend coming early because they do tend to run out quick of the good stuff. Pricing is definitely on the high side so if you aren't trying to break the bank on small pieces of cake, you might not want to come because the average slice is over $5."
241,"*Little slice of Hungarian paradise*Apparently this place has been here since 1998. Weird- because I've never noticed it in the neighborhood. Swear my little piggy self noticed & STOPPED by  EVERY sweet shop between my granny's house (insert image of little red riding hood.. except .. I'm clearly brown) and UC Berkeley (back when I took summer classes there Circa '2002ish)WhatevsThis place is so cool. Glad my friend's bf recommended this spot.They have class, culture, cute decorations and the most delicious sweets ever . Not to mention their espresso is pretty decent annnnd they have the most adorable Short coffee cups to go. (Toddler size)So I stopped by around 5:00 & they close at 5:30 on a Tuesday. They were extremely patient and not rushing to clean up- which is nice (hate walking into a store that closes in 1 hour and they're cleaning up).I recommend their almond cream cake which was so dang moist and light as a feather ($5ish). If you like white cake with a slight nut flavor- you'll go for this, and I do mean SLIGHT. It was so good and light I finished the cake on autopilot in 2.2 seconds. Other tasty treats : tiramisu, their seasonal strawberry cake and this awesome looking chocolate cream cakeNotes:- great shaded parking out front - chill location- apparently hecka Hungarians show up on Saturday's which is cool if you identify with that culture - patient staff  - all cakes cost around $5/$5.50"

I'm partial to their Soprano version which is made with a layer of their smoky dark chocolate. I also recently tried their vanilla bizet, which is like a pavlova, all ethereal and Christmas white. The meringue base was firm yet dissolved into perfect flaky sweetness once I bit into it and the vanilla cream was exquisite and again, not too sweet. Truly a local's delight and one that I hope continue to flourish in Berkeley for years to come!"
266,"Crixa is both great and terrible. Great because of their food and coffee, terrible because of their hours and...while not terrible, the ladies behind the counter are always brusque and don't have any time for your shit. Get it together, this is a business.Crixa is totally open during the week when no one buys cake at 2 PM on a Thursday, but not on Sundays. So go on a Saturday. But do go early, because they will run out of stuff and they won't be sorry about it. They'll tell you that you should've come earlier. The bizet and ginger cake are two of our favorites, and their coffee is quite good. The coffee is pricey, but you're also shelling out $4.50 for a pastry, so go big or go home.They do have limited outdoor seating, but beware if it's sunny outside--the tables are metal and will burn your skin off. The good: delicious pastries.The bad: hours could be better."
267,"This place has the best baked goods in the Bay Area, possibly the North American continent, and maybe the world (outside of France)! Yeah, I love them! Forget tartine, or any of the other bakeries, they can't compare. I drive 2.5 hours, 2-3 times a month to get their cakes. One of my favorite things about it is that the cakes are sooo good, and the guys there are true to their Hungarian roots :) reserved and professional without any of the fake American friendliness! Win-win- I don't have to fake smile, I just get to honestly smile at them because I am glad to see them and their wonderful cakes! Btw, it would be six stars, if it were an option."
268,"Soooooo rude. Both women didn't say a single word to me. I asked for what I wanted and the lady rang up my order and just said the total while the other boxed up the dessert. The lady at the register turned the screen toward me to sign the screen. After I signed my signature she handed me my card and I said ""Thank you"".  In a low voice she said ""thank you"". If I didn't say anything she wouldn't have said anything to me. There was no greeting, or can I help you, nothing from either of the two. They seemed like they were miserable and I must have been bothering them. Why would anyone want to pay someone to treat them like that? 1st and last time ever going there. Beware if you want to be treated like a paying customer that is appreciated and supporting their business. If it doesn't matter to you then stop by for the slim pickings of variety."
269,"You know how good this place is? So good I couldn't wait to write a review. I seriously took 2 bites out of my tiramisu cake and 2 from my coconut cake and just HAD to write it right now [with my cake beside me.] I am in heaven.Coconut cake: Nice and moist with just the right amount of coconut! It does not have an overwhelming amount of coconut flavor or cream. I am definitely a fan.Tiramisu: Perfection! It's not often you come across great tiramisu so I was just blown away at the perfection of Crixa's. It is perfectly moist and the filling was on point with the right amount of expresso flavor. I am definitely a fan of this place as I'm sure you can tell. I was pretty shocked to see all my coworkers getting seconds as well! Typically for any sweets, I don't see many grabbing seconds. This time I saw them grabbing seconds and debating what to get as their third!  Where have you guys been in my life!"
270,"Amazing cakes, awful service. What a bummer because this place otherwise deserves 5 stars without a doubt.Came here to pick up my Dad's bday cake that my sister pre-ordered and paid over the phone. When I walked into the store, the employee looked at me with a very unamused look. I told her that I was here to pick up a cake, and showed her the receipt that my sister said they instructed us to do. She responded, ""Just tell me the name."" very bluntly with a rude untertone.After, I asked her for a bag and explained that I had to walk to the BART station and then take the train home. It was Friday, so I knew the trains would be busy. She told flattly told me they were $0.30, and when I asked if I could pay with card, she said no then quickly put it away. I then had to hold the cake very still on my hour and a half commute from the store. Afterwards, I told my sister my experience and she confirmed that they were a piece of work on the phone too.However, once we finally dug into the cake, I gotta admit it was AMAZING! We got the Amaretti, and wow. The cake itself was very fluffy and moist. The cream was devine! And the little bits on top, not exactly sure what they were, but they gave it a perfect yet slight crunch.All in all, I'm just kind of surprised with Crixa's. Why wouldn't you treat customers kindly? As someone that has worked as a server, I understand that food may be good but customer service is what makes people loyal - it goes hand and hand! Crixa's is delicious, but don't come here if you're expecting the full experience that includes both delicious food and amazing service. I would honestly rather spend my money at a place that would happily do both, considering this small cake was $28."
271,"After walking up to Summer Kitchen and Bake Shop but finding out their pastry chef had left so they had no cookies, cakes, etc. I headed towards the next Berkeley bakery on my list - Crixa.  Honestly, I was a bit unsure exactly what a Russian bakery would be like but turns out its pretty much like any other bakery :)  The amaretto cake was as good as the other reviewers suggest and it almost melts in your mouth.  I also tried the apple cake (with whipped cream on the side) and that was pretty good, but not as sweet as I would have liked (though the cashier warned me about that upfront).  Overall, a great experience and I was particularly surprised/delighted by how many different types of cakes, pies, and tarts they have - at least a dozen or so different flavors (though many of them were sold out by the time I got there)."
272,My favorite dessert place within walking distance! Love their flourless chocolate cake
273,"A couple of my friends have raved about this bakery and I can see why!The cakes, though a bit pricey, are worth every dollar. The cakes I have tried have all been moist and delicious. It really annoys me when frosting on cakes is too sweet, and Crixa nails the sugar ratio. My favorite cake here has to be the jamaican rum chocolate mousse cake. This cake is absolutely delicious. The rum isn't lost in the baking, as the cake is soaked, making for a really delicious cake."
274,I lived in Germany for many years and travelled through Central Europe. Crixa sort of ruined it for me because I thought I'd had the best Central European pastries around. After going to crixa I returned to Central Europe and dined in the finest coffeehouses where all the great cultural people did their culture and i felt a deep sorrow. How can crixa be the best? Berkeley continues its food domination. I hope this place doesn't get too popular because it's like the secret came out.
275,"Nice little coffee shop. Clean with a welcoming, funky decor. Very friendly and helpful staff. Fair prices.Good espresso. Loved the tres leches cake. Great place to get a slice of cake and a good cup of coffee."
276,"Best sour cherry pie I've ever had- looking forward to a return visit next week.Decor is reminiscent of a European cafe, quaint and charming."
277,"The flourless chocolate cake and poppy seed rugelah are not to be missed. The cake, in particular, was beautifully chocolatey with a lovely light texture. We also tried the ginger round, which was fine, but nothing to write home about. Loved the other two items and will be back for a slice of the pear and rose cream tarte!"
278,"I had heard about this place and from the Yelp reviews was really looking forward to a Boston Cream cake.  Alas, we arrived on a Saturday after 2pm and there wasn't much selection at all.  I selected a slice of the Florio cake, as the almond/raspberry combo sounded good to me but I was a little skeptical about the rose flavored creme, as I generally don't like flowery flavors (teas, etc).I must admit I was pleasantly surprised and I really enjoyed this cake.  The flavors and textures blended very nicely- creamy, crunchy, the rose flavor very subtle.  Definitely a quality cake but a bit of a splurge ($5.45/slice).  Not something I'd buy every day for that price but you get what you pay for!  Can't wait to try the Boston Creme next time, I'll have to get there in the morning!"
279,"I have enjoyed both cakes and pies from Crixa. All products I have tried were excellent. The ingredients were fresh , moist and well prepared.It has become my go to bakery. Accordingly I would recommend this bakery as one of the best in the Bay areao"
280,"Perfect amount of sweetness that's light fluff cakes (if that makes any sense) Seriously one of my favorite places to come when I have a sweet tooth! I love everything they bake here but my favorite has to be the Amaretto, Strawberry cream and the flourless chocolate. Highly recommend coming early because they do tend to run out quick of the good stuff. Pricing is definitely on the high side so if you aren't trying to break the bank on small pieces of cake, you might not want to come because the average slice is over $5."
281,"*Little slice of Hungarian paradise*Apparently this place has been here since 1998. Weird- because I've never noticed it in the neighborhood. Swear my little piggy self noticed & STOPPED by  EVERY sweet shop between my granny's house (insert image of little red riding hood.. except .. I'm clearly brown) and UC Berkeley (back when I took summer classes there Circa '2002ish)WhatevsThis place is so cool. Glad my friend's bf recommended this spot.They have class, culture, cute decorations and the most delicious sweets ever . Not to mention their espresso is pretty decent annnnd they have the most adorable Short coffee cups to go. (Toddler size)So I stopped by around 5:00 & they close at 5:30 on a Tuesday. They were extremely patient and not rushing to clean up- which is nice (hate walking into a store that closes in 1 hour and they're cleaning up).I recommend their almond cream cake which was so dang moist and light as a feather ($5ish). If you like white cake with a slight nut flavor- you'll go for this, and I do mean SLIGHT. It was so good and light I finished the cake on autopilot in 2.2 seconds. Other tasty treats : tiramisu, their seasonal strawberry cake and this awesome looking chocolate cream cakeNotes:- great shaded parking out front - chill location- apparently hecka Hungarians show up on Saturday's which is cool if you identify with that culture - patient staff  - all cakes cost around $5/$5.50"
282,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while particularly for their Amaretti cake, Tiramisu, and Boston Creme pies. HoweverI've never been able to make it here during the weekdays since they close at 5:30, so I decided to test my luck coming here on a Saturday at around 2PM (they close at 4).Much like what others have echoed, definitely come here early because the assortment you can chose from dwindles down. Luckily there were still a few slices of the Amaretti cake, but I think the other things I came to try were already sold out. They also have a few items in a separate display case by the register away from the cake display so be sure to check those items out. LOCATION: Right on Shattuck there is some street parking near this location but I think it's easier to walk from BART or bus to. They have seating inside for those who want coffee and even a few tables outside that they also bus.FOOD: $5 a slice is pricey for me, but one time for the one time right. The Amaretti cake was definitely worth the walk and I'm not a huge cake fan! The cake was moist, the cream light/airy, and overall sweet but not too sweet. The added cookies on top made for a great change in texture and sweetness to the cake. Even though I finished a slice myself, I didn't feel like I got cavities while doing so (well I hope not. haha). SERVICE: I only came here to get a cake to-go so I can't really comment on the sentiments of other Yelpers about the service. The service was friendly and greeted me right when I walked through the door, but to be honest I did feel a little rushed even though there was nobody behind me. Luckily I already knew what I wanted but I can only imagine how it would be if you had no idea. CONS: I couldn't give it 5 stars for these reasons - Hours - Limited assortment later in the day"
283,"Soft, delectable, moist cakes, the ~$5 slices of cakes here are totally worth a trip! Many Yelpers have mentioned that the ladies here aren't so friendly and that the cakes do sell out as the day goes on, so be sure to come earlier and check their website to see what delicious baked goods they're selling each day. I also found the ladies here to be pretty friendly! Anyways, the cake. I got:1) Tiramisu (5/5) - Definitely one of the best tiramisu I've enjoyed. The cake itself is so moist, and majorly soaked in coffee, contributing to the overall softness of this cake. The cream is whipped to perfect smoothness, and the flavor of this cake is absolutely delicious. Though the slice isn't that big for ~$5, I would say it's such a rich (though not heavy) dessert that the slice is a good size!2) Amaretti (5/5) - I think I love this cake more than the tiramisu. I love the vanilla flavor, smoooooth cream, soft moist fluffy cake, and the added crunch of the crushed crackers on top.  I'll definitely be back to try more things!"
284,The tiramisu with dark chocolate mousse is to.die.for.
285,"I've been coming here for years but keep forgetting to leave a review. As an undergrad I would go dessert hopping whenever I wanted to treat myself and hit up a bunch of bakeries and gorge (La Farine, Crixa, and Katrina Rozelle).

I am definitely a fan of this place as I'm sure you can tell. I was pretty shocked to see all my coworkers getting seconds as well! Typically for any sweets, I don't see many grabbing seconds. This time I saw them grabbing seconds and debating what to get as their third!  Where have you guys been in my life!"
310,"Amazing cakes, awful service. What a bummer because this place otherwise deserves 5 stars without a doubt.Came here to pick up my Dad's bday cake that my sister pre-ordered and paid over the phone. When I walked into the store, the employee looked at me with a very unamused look. I told her that I was here to pick up a cake, and showed her the receipt that my sister said they instructed us to do. She responded, ""Just tell me the name."" very bluntly with a rude untertone.After, I asked her for a bag and explained that I had to walk to the BART station and then take the train home. It was Friday, so I knew the trains would be busy. She told flattly told me they were $0.30, and when I asked if I could pay with card, she said no then quickly put it away. I then had to hold the cake very still on my hour and a half commute from the store. Afterwards, I told my sister my experience and she confirmed that they were a piece of work on the phone too.However, once we finally dug into the cake, I gotta admit it was AMAZING! We got the Amaretti, and wow. The cake itself was very fluffy and moist. The cream was devine! And the little bits on top, not exactly sure what they were, but they gave it a perfect yet slight crunch.All in all, I'm just kind of surprised with Crixa's. Why wouldn't you treat customers kindly? As someone that has worked as a server, I understand that food may be good but customer service is what makes people loyal - it goes hand and hand! Crixa's is delicious, but don't come here if you're expecting the full experience that includes both delicious food and amazing service. I would honestly rather spend my money at a place that would happily do both, considering this small cake was $28."
311,"After walking up to Summer Kitchen and Bake Shop but finding out their pastry chef had left so they had no cookies, cakes, etc. I headed towards the next Berkeley bakery on my list - Crixa.  Honestly, I was a bit unsure exactly what a Russian bakery would be like but turns out its pretty much like any other bakery :)  The amaretto cake was as good as the other reviewers suggest and it almost melts in your mouth.  I also tried the apple cake (with whipped cream on the side) and that was pretty good, but not as sweet as I would have liked (though the cashier warned me about that upfront).  Overall, a great experience and I was particularly surprised/delighted by how many different types of cakes, pies, and tarts they have - at least a dozen or so different flavors (though many of them were sold out by the time I got there)."
312,My favorite dessert place within walking distance! Love their flourless chocolate cake
313,"A couple of my friends have raved about this bakery and I can see why!The cakes, though a bit pricey, are worth every dollar. The cakes I have tried have all been moist and delicious. It really annoys me when frosting on cakes is too sweet, and Crixa nails the sugar ratio. My favorite cake here has to be the jamaican rum chocolate mousse cake. This cake is absolutely delicious. The rum isn't lost in the baking, as the cake is soaked, making for a really delicious cake."
314,I lived in Germany for many years and travelled through Central Europe. Crixa sort of ruined it for me because I thought I'd had the best Central European pastries around. After going to crixa I returned to Central Europe and dined in the finest coffeehouses where all the great cultural people did their culture and i felt a deep sorrow. How can crixa be the best? Berkeley continues its food domination. I hope this place doesn't get too popular because it's like the secret came out.
315,"Nice little coffee shop. Clean with a welcoming, funky decor. Very friendly and helpful staff. Fair prices.Good espresso. Loved the tres leches cake. Great place to get a slice of cake and a good cup of coffee."
316,"Best sour cherry pie I've ever had- looking forward to a return visit next week.Decor is reminiscent of a European cafe, quaint and charming."
317,"The flourless chocolate cake and poppy seed rugelah are not to be missed. The cake, in particular, was beautifully chocolatey with a lovely light texture. We also tried the ginger round, which was fine, but nothing to write home about. Loved the other two items and will be back for a slice of the pear and rose cream tarte!"
318,"I had heard about this place and from the Yelp reviews was really looking forward to a Boston Cream cake.  Alas, we arrived on a Saturday after 2pm and there wasn't much selection at all.  I selected a slice of the Florio cake, as the almond/raspberry combo sounded good to me but I was a little skeptical about the rose flavored creme, as I generally don't like flowery flavors (teas, etc).I must admit I was pleasantly surprised and I really enjoyed this cake.  The flavors and textures blended very nicely- creamy, crunchy, the rose flavor very subtle.  Definitely a quality cake but a bit of a splurge ($5.45/slice).  Not something I'd buy every day for that price but you get what you pay for!  Can't wait to try the Boston Creme next time, I'll have to get there in the morning!"
319,"I have enjoyed both cakes and pies from Crixa. All products I have tried were excellent. The ingredients were fresh , moist and well prepared.It has become my go to bakery. Accordingly I would recommend this bakery as one of the best in the Bay areao"
320,"Perfect amount of sweetness that's light fluff cakes (if that makes any sense) Seriously one of my favorite places to come when I have a sweet tooth! I love everything they bake here but my favorite has to be the Amaretto, Strawberry cream and the flourless chocolate. Highly recommend coming early because they do tend to run out quick of the good stuff. Pricing is definitely on the high side so if you aren't trying to break the bank on small pieces of cake, you might not want to come because the average slice is over $5."
321,"*Little slice of Hungarian paradise*Apparently this place has been here since 1998. Weird- because I've never noticed it in the neighborhood. Swear my little piggy self noticed & STOPPED by  EVERY sweet shop between my granny's house (insert image of little red riding hood.. except .. I'm clearly brown) and UC Berkeley (back when I took summer classes there Circa '2002ish)WhatevsThis place is so cool. Glad my friend's bf recommended this spot.They have class, culture, cute decorations and the most delicious sweets ever . Not to mention their espresso is pretty decent annnnd they have the most adorable Short coffee cups to go. (Toddler size)So I stopped by around 5:00 & they close at 5:30 on a Tuesday. They were extremely patient and not rushing to clean up- which is nice (hate walking into a store that closes in 1 hour and they're cleaning up).I recommend their almond cream cake which was so dang moist and light as a feather ($5ish). If you like white cake with a slight nut flavor- you'll go for this, and I do mean SLIGHT. It was so good and light I finished the cake on autopilot in 2.2 seconds. Other tasty treats : tiramisu, their seasonal strawberry cake and this awesome looking chocolate cream cakeNotes:- great shaded parking out front - chill location- apparently hecka Hungarians show up on Saturday's which is cool if you identify with that culture - patient staff  - all cakes cost around $5/$5.50"
322,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while particularly for their Amaretti cake, Tiramisu, and Boston Creme pies. HoweverI've never been able to make it here during the weekdays since they close at 5:30, so I decided to test my luck coming here on a Saturday at around 2PM (they close at 4).Much like what others have echoed, definitely come here early because the assortment you can chose from dwindles down. Luckily there were still a few slices of the Amaretti cake, but I think the other things I came to try were already sold out. They also have a few items in a separate display case by the register away from the cake display so be sure to check those items out. LOCATION: Right on Shattuck there is some street parking near this location but I think it's easier to walk from BART or bus to. They have seating inside for those who want coffee and even a few tables outside that they also bus.FOOD: $5 a slice is pricey for me, but one time for the one time right. The Amaretti cake was definitely worth the walk and I'm not a huge cake fan! The cake was moist, the cream light/airy, and overall sweet but not too sweet. The added cookies on top made for a great change in texture and sweetness to the cake. Even though I finished a slice myself, I didn't feel like I got cavities while doing so (well I hope not. haha). SERVICE: I only came here to get a cake to-go so I can't really comment on the sentiments of other Yelpers about the service. The service was friendly and greeted me right when I walked through the door, but to be honest I did feel a little rushed even though there was nobody behind me. Luckily I already knew what I wanted but I can only imagine how it would be if you had no idea. CONS: I couldn't give it 5 stars for these reasons - Hours - Limited assortment later in the day"
323,"Soft, delectable, moist cakes, the ~$5 slices of cakes here are totally worth a trip! Many Yelpers have mentioned that the ladies here aren't so friendly and that the cakes do sell out as the day goes on, so be sure to come earlier and check their website to see what delicious baked goods they're selling each day. I also found the ladies here to be pretty friendly! Anyways, the cake. I got:1) Tiramisu (5/5) - Definitely one of the best tiramisu I've enjoyed. The cake itself is so moist, and majorly soaked in coffee, contributing to the overall softness of this cake. The cream is whipped to perfect smoothness, and the flavor of this cake is absolutely delicious. Though the slice isn't that big for ~$5, I would say it's such a rich (though not heavy) dessert that the slice is a good size!2) Amaretti (5/5) - I think I love this cake more than the tiramisu. I love the vanilla flavor, smoooooth cream, soft moist fluffy cake, and the added crunch of the crushed crackers on top.  I'll definitely be back to try more things!"
324,The tiramisu with dark chocolate mousse is to.die.for.
325,"I've been coming here for years but keep forgetting to leave a review. As an undergrad I would go dessert hopping whenever I wanted to treat myself and hit up a bunch of bakeries and gorge (La Farine, Crixa, and Katrina Rozelle). Berkeley is not lacking in homey cake shops but I feel like each one has their own speciality, so it really depends on your mood.Crixa has a modest menu and a distinctive Eastern European influence (they sell pierogies and kifli!). I've tried almost all their standard cakes and their crowning glory has to be their tiramisu. The sponge cake is always perfectly moist and rich with espresso flavors, while the mascarpone is airy, light, and never too sweet. I'm partial to their Soprano version which is made with a layer of their smoky dark chocolate. I also recently tried their vanilla bizet, which is like a pavlova, all ethereal and Christmas white. The meringue base was firm yet dissolved into perfect flaky sweetness once I bit into it and the vanilla cream was exquisite and again, not too sweet. Truly a local's delight and one that I hope continue to flourish in Berkeley for years to come!"
326,"Crixa is both great and terrible. Great because of their food and coffee, terrible because of their hours and...while not terrible, the ladies behind the counter are always brusque and don't have any time for your shit. Get it together, this is a business.Crixa is totally open during the week when no one buys cake at 2 PM on a Thursday, but not on Sundays. So go on a Saturday. But do go early, because they will run out of stuff and they won't be sorry about it. They'll tell you that you should've come earlier. The bizet and ginger cake are two of our favorites, and their coffee is quite good. The coffee is pricey, but you're also shelling out $4.50 for a pastry, so go big or go home.They do have limited outdoor seating, but beware if it's sunny outside--the tables are metal and will burn your skin off. The good: delicious pastries.The bad: hours could be better."
327,"This place has the best baked goods in the Bay Area, possibly the North American continent, and maybe the world (outside of France)! Yeah, I love them! Forget tartine, or any of the other bakeries, they can't compare. I drive 2.5 hours, 2-3 times a month to get their cakes. One of my favorite things about it is that the cakes are sooo good, and the guys there are true to their Hungarian roots :) reserved and professional without any of the fake American friendliness! Win-win- I don't have to fake smile, I just get to honestly smile at them because I am glad to see them and their wonderful cakes! Btw, it would be six stars, if it were an option."
328,"Soooooo rude. Both women didn't say a single word to me. I asked for what I wanted and the lady rang up my order and just said the total while the other boxed up the dessert. The lady at the register turned the screen toward me to sign the screen. After I signed my signature she handed me my card and I said ""Thank you"".  In a low voice she said ""thank you"". If I didn't say anything she wouldn't have said anything to me. There was no greeting, or can I help you, nothing from either of the two. They seemed like they were miserable and I must have been bothering them. Why would anyone want to pay someone to treat them like that? 1st and last time ever going there. Beware if you want to be treated like a paying customer that is appreciated and supporting their business. If it doesn't matter to you then stop by for the slim pickings of variety."
329,"You know how good this place is? So good I couldn't wait to write a review. I seriously took 2 bites out of my tiramisu cake and 2 from my coconut cake and just HAD to write it right now [with my cake beside me.] I am in heaven.Coconut cake: Nice and moist with just the right amount of coconut! It does not have an overwhelming amount of coconut flavor or cream. I am definitely a fan.Tiramisu: Perfection!

354,I lived in Germany for many years and travelled through Central Europe. Crixa sort of ruined it for me because I thought I'd had the best Central European pastries around. After going to crixa I returned to Central Europe and dined in the finest coffeehouses where all the great cultural people did their culture and i felt a deep sorrow. How can crixa be the best? Berkeley continues its food domination. I hope this place doesn't get too popular because it's like the secret came out.
355,"Nice little coffee shop. Clean with a welcoming, funky decor. Very friendly and helpful staff. Fair prices.Good espresso. Loved the tres leches cake. Great place to get a slice of cake and a good cup of coffee."
356,"Best sour cherry pie I've ever had- looking forward to a return visit next week.Decor is reminiscent of a European cafe, quaint and charming."
357,"The flourless chocolate cake and poppy seed rugelah are not to be missed. The cake, in particular, was beautifully chocolatey with a lovely light texture. We also tried the ginger round, which was fine, but nothing to write home about. Loved the other two items and will be back for a slice of the pear and rose cream tarte!"
358,"I had heard about this place and from the Yelp reviews was really looking forward to a Boston Cream cake.  Alas, we arrived on a Saturday after 2pm and there wasn't much selection at all.  I selected a slice of the Florio cake, as the almond/raspberry combo sounded good to me but I was a little skeptical about the rose flavored creme, as I generally don't like flowery flavors (teas, etc).I must admit I was pleasantly surprised and I really enjoyed this cake.  The flavors and textures blended very nicely- creamy, crunchy, the rose flavor very subtle.  Definitely a quality cake but a bit of a splurge ($5.45/slice).  Not something I'd buy every day for that price but you get what you pay for!  Can't wait to try the Boston Creme next time, I'll have to get there in the morning!"
359,"I have enjoyed both cakes and pies from Crixa. All products I have tried were excellent. The ingredients were fresh , moist and well prepared.It has become my go to bakery. Accordingly I would recommend this bakery as one of the best in the Bay areao"
360,"Perfect amount of sweetness that's light fluff cakes (if that makes any sense) Seriously one of my favorite places to come when I have a sweet tooth! I love everything they bake here but my favorite has to be the Amaretto, Strawberry cream and the flourless chocolate. Highly recommend coming early because they do tend to run out quick of the good stuff. Pricing is definitely on the high side so if you aren't trying to break the bank on small pieces of cake, you might not want to come because the average slice is over $5."
361,"*Little slice of Hungarian paradise*Apparently this place has been here since 1998. Weird- because I've never noticed it in the neighborhood. Swear my little piggy self noticed & STOPPED by  EVERY sweet shop between my granny's house (insert image of little red riding hood.. except .. I'm clearly brown) and UC Berkeley (back when I took summer classes there Circa '2002ish)WhatevsThis place is so cool. Glad my friend's bf recommended this spot.They have class, culture, cute decorations and the most delicious sweets ever . Not to mention their espresso is pretty decent annnnd they have the most adorable Short coffee cups to go. (Toddler size)So I stopped by around 5:00 & they close at 5:30 on a Tuesday. They were extremely patient and not rushing to clean up- which is nice (hate walking into a store that closes in 1 hour and they're cleaning up).I recommend their almond cream cake which was so dang moist and light as a feather ($5ish). If you like white cake with a slight nut flavor- you'll go for this, and I do mean SLIGHT. It was so good and light I finished the cake on autopilot in 2.2 seconds. Other tasty treats : tiramisu, their seasonal strawberry cake and this awesome looking chocolate cream cakeNotes:- great shaded parking out front - chill location- apparently hecka Hungarians show up on Saturday's which is cool if you identify with that culture - patient staff  - all cakes cost around $5/$5.50"
362,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while particularly for their Amaretti cake, Tiramisu, and Boston Creme pies. HoweverI've never been able to make it here during the weekdays since they close at 5:30, so I decided to test my luck coming here on a Saturday at around 2PM (they close at 4).Much like what others have echoed, definitely come here early because the assortment you can chose from dwindles down. Luckily there were still a few slices of the Amaretti cake, but I think the other things I came to try were already sold out. They also have a few items in a separate display case by the register away from the cake display so be sure to check those items out. LOCATION: Right on Shattuck there is some street parking near this location but I think it's easier to walk from BART or bus to. They have seating inside for those who want coffee and even a few tables outside that they also bus.FOOD: $5 a slice is pricey for me, but one time for the one time right. The Amaretti cake was definitely worth the walk and I'm not a huge cake fan! The cake was moist, the cream light/airy, and overall sweet but not too sweet. The added cookies on top made for a great change in texture and sweetness to the cake. Even though I finished a slice myself, I didn't feel like I got cavities while doing so (well I hope not. haha). SERVICE: I only came here to get a cake to-go so I can't really comment on the sentiments of other Yelpers about the service. The service was friendly and greeted me right when I walked through the door, but to be honest I did feel a little rushed even though there was nobody behind me. Luckily I already knew what I wanted but I can only imagine how it would be if you had no idea. CONS: I couldn't give it 5 stars for these reasons - Hours - Limited assortment later in the day"
363,"Soft, delectable, moist cakes, the ~$5 slices of cakes here are totally worth a trip! Many Yelpers have mentioned that the ladies here aren't so friendly and that the cakes do sell out as the day goes on, so be sure to come earlier and check their website to see what delicious baked goods they're selling each day. I also found the ladies here to be pretty friendly! Anyways, the cake. I got:1) Tiramisu (5/5) - Definitely one of the best tiramisu I've enjoyed. The cake itself is so moist, and majorly soaked in coffee, contributing to the overall softness of this cake. The cream is whipped to perfect smoothness, and the flavor of this cake is absolutely delicious. Though the slice isn't that big for ~$5, I would say it's such a rich (though not heavy) dessert that the slice is a good size!2) Amaretti (5/5) - I think I love this cake more than the tiramisu. I love the vanilla flavor, smoooooth cream, soft moist fluffy cake, and the added crunch of the crushed crackers on top.  I'll definitely be back to try more things!"
364,The tiramisu with dark chocolate mousse is to.die.for.
365,"I've been coming here for years but keep forgetting to leave a review. As an undergrad I would go dessert hopping whenever I wanted to treat myself and hit up a bunch of bakeries and gorge (La Farine, Crixa, and Katrina Rozelle). Berkeley is not lacking in homey cake shops but I feel like each one has their own speciality, so it really depends on your mood.Crixa has a modest menu and a distinctive Eastern European influence (they sell pierogies and kifli!). I've tried almost all their standard cakes and their crowning glory has to be their tiramisu. The sponge cake is always perfectly moist and rich with espresso flavors, while the mascarpone is airy, light, and never too sweet. I'm partial to their Soprano version which is made with a layer of their smoky dark chocolate. I also recently tried their vanilla bizet, which is like a pavlova, all ethereal and Christmas white. The meringue base was firm yet dissolved into perfect flaky sweetness once I bit into it and the vanilla cream was exquisite and again, not too sweet. Truly a local's delight and one that I hope continue to flourish in Berkeley for years to come!"
366,"Crixa is both great and terrible. Great because of their food and coffee, terrible because of their hours and...while not terrible, the ladies behind the counter are always brusque and don't have any time for your shit. Get it together, this is a business.Crixa is totally open during the week when no one buys cake at 2 PM on a Thursday, but not on Sundays. So go on a Saturday. But do go early, because they will run out of stuff and they won't be sorry about it. They'll tell you that you should've come earlier. The bizet and ginger cake are two of our favorites, and their coffee is quite good. The coffee is pricey, but you're also shelling out $4.50 for a pastry, so go big or go home.They do have limited outdoor seating, but beware if it's sunny outside--the tables are metal and will burn your skin off. The good: delicious pastries.The bad: hours could be better."
367,"This place has the best baked goods in the Bay Area, possibly the North American continent, and maybe the world (outside of France)! Yeah, I love them! Forget tartine, or any of the other bakeries, they can't compare. I drive 2.5 hours, 2-3 times a month to get their cakes. One of my favorite things about it is that the cakes are sooo good, and the guys there are true to their Hungarian roots :) reserved and professional without any of the fake American friendliness! Win-win- I don't have to fake smile, I just get to honestly smile at them because I am glad to see them and their wonderful cakes! Btw, it would be six stars, if it were an option."
368,"Soooooo rude. Both women didn't say a single word to me. I asked for what I wanted and the lady rang up my order and just said the total while the other boxed up the dessert. The lady at the register turned the screen toward me to sign the screen. After I signed my signature she handed me my card and I said ""Thank you"".  In a low voice she said ""thank you"". If I didn't say anything she wouldn't have said anything to me. There was no greeting, or can I help you, nothing from either of the two. They seemed like they were miserable and I must have been bothering them. Why would anyone want to pay someone to treat them like that? 1st and last time ever going there. Beware if you want to be treated like a paying customer that is appreciated and supporting their business. If it doesn't matter to you then stop by for the slim pickings of variety."
369,"You know how good this place is? So good I couldn't wait to write a review. I seriously took 2 bites out of my tiramisu cake and 2 from my coconut cake and just HAD to write it right now [with my cake beside me.] I am in heaven.Coconut cake: Nice and moist with just the right amount of coconut! It does not have an overwhelming amount of coconut flavor or cream. I am definitely a fan.Tiramisu: Perfection! It's not often you come across great tiramisu so I was just blown away at the perfection of Crixa's. It is perfectly moist and the filling was on point with the right amount of expresso flavor. I am definitely a fan of this place as I'm sure you can tell. I was pretty shocked to see all my coworkers getting seconds as well! Typically for any sweets, I don't see many grabbing seconds. This time I saw them grabbing seconds and debating what to get as their third!  Where have you guys been in my life!"
370,"Amazing cakes, awful service. What a bummer because this place otherwise deserves 5 stars without a doubt.Came here to pick up my Dad's bday cake that my sister pre-ordered and paid over the phone. When I walked into the store, the employee looked at me with a very unamused look. I told her that I was here to pick up a cake, and showed her the receipt that my sister said they instructed us to do. She responded, ""Just tell me the name."" very bluntly with a rude untertone.After, I asked her for a bag and explained that I had to walk to the BART station and then take the train home. It was Friday, so I knew the trains would be busy. She told flattly told me they were $0.30, and when I asked if I could pay with card, she said no then quickly put it away. I then had to hold the cake very still on my hour and a half commute from the store. Afterwards, I told my sister my experience and she confirmed that they were a piece of work on the phone too.However, once we finally dug into the cake, I gotta admit it was AMAZING! We got the Amaretti, and wow. The cake itself was very fluffy and moist. The cream was devine! And the little bits on top, not exactly sure what they were, but they gave it a perfect yet slight crunch.All in all, I'm just kind of surprised with Crixa's. Why wouldn't you treat customers kindly? As someone that has worked as a server, I understand that food may be good but customer service is what makes people loyal - it goes hand and hand! Crixa's is delicious, but don't come here if you're expecting the full experience that includes both delicious food and amazing service. I would honestly rather spend my money at a place that would happily do both, considering this small cake was $28."
371,"After walking up to Summer Kitchen and Bake Shop but finding out their pastry chef had left so they had no cookies, cakes, etc. I headed towards the next Berkeley bakery on my list - Crixa.  Honestly, I was a bit unsure exactly what a Russian bakery would be like but turns out its pretty much like any other bakery :)  The amaretto cake was as good as the other reviewers suggest and it almost melts in your mouth.  I also tried the apple cake (with whipped cream on the side) and that was pretty good, but not as sweet as I would have liked (though the cashier warned me about that upfront).  Overall, a great experience and I was particularly surprised/delighted by how many different types of cakes, pies, and tarts they have - at least a dozen or so different flavors (though many of them were sold out by the time I got there)."
372,My favorite dessert place within walking distance! Love their flourless chocolate cake

They were extremely patient and not rushing to clean up- which is nice (hate walking into a store that closes in 1 hour and they're cleaning up).I recommend their almond cream cake which was so dang moist and light as a feather ($5ish). If you like white cake with a slight nut flavor- you'll go for this, and I do mean SLIGHT. It was so good and light I finished the cake on autopilot in 2.2 seconds. Other tasty treats : tiramisu, their seasonal strawberry cake and this awesome looking chocolate cream cakeNotes:- great shaded parking out front - chill location- apparently hecka Hungarians show up on Saturday's which is cool if you identify with that culture - patient staff  - all cakes cost around $5/$5.50"
402,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while particularly for their Amaretti cake, Tiramisu, and Boston Creme pies. HoweverI've never been able to make it here during the weekdays since they close at 5:30, so I decided to test my luck coming here on a Saturday at around 2PM (they close at 4).Much like what others have echoed, definitely come here early because the assortment you can chose from dwindles down. Luckily there were still a few slices of the Amaretti cake, but I think the other things I came to try were already sold out. They also have a few items in a separate display case by the register away from the cake display so be sure to check those items out. LOCATION: Right on Shattuck there is some street parking near this location but I think it's easier to walk from BART or bus to. They have seating inside for those who want coffee and even a few tables outside that they also bus.FOOD: $5 a slice is pricey for me, but one time for the one time right. The Amaretti cake was definitely worth the walk and I'm not a huge cake fan! The cake was moist, the cream light/airy, and overall sweet but not too sweet. The added cookies on top made for a great change in texture and sweetness to the cake. Even though I finished a slice myself, I didn't feel like I got cavities while doing so (well I hope not. haha). SERVICE: I only came here to get a cake to-go so I can't really comment on the sentiments of other Yelpers about the service. The service was friendly and greeted me right when I walked through the door, but to be honest I did feel a little rushed even though there was nobody behind me. Luckily I already knew what I wanted but I can only imagine how it would be if you had no idea. CONS: I couldn't give it 5 stars for these reasons - Hours - Limited assortment later in the day"
403,"Soft, delectable, moist cakes, the ~$5 slices of cakes here are totally worth a trip! Many Yelpers have mentioned that the ladies here aren't so friendly and that the cakes do sell out as the day goes on, so be sure to come earlier and check their website to see what delicious baked goods they're selling each day. I also found the ladies here to be pretty friendly! Anyways, the cake. I got:1) Tiramisu (5/5) - Definitely one of the best tiramisu I've enjoyed. The cake itself is so moist, and majorly soaked in coffee, contributing to the overall softness of this cake. The cream is whipped to perfect smoothness, and the flavor of this cake is absolutely delicious. Though the slice isn't that big for ~$5, I would say it's such a rich (though not heavy) dessert that the slice is a good size!2) Amaretti (5/5) - I think I love this cake more than the tiramisu. I love the vanilla flavor, smoooooth cream, soft moist fluffy cake, and the added crunch of the crushed crackers on top.  I'll definitely be back to try more things!"
404,The tiramisu with dark chocolate mousse is to.die.for.
405,"I've been coming here for years but keep forgetting to leave a review. As an undergrad I would go dessert hopping whenever I wanted to treat myself and hit up a bunch of bakeries and gorge (La Farine, Crixa, and Katrina Rozelle). Berkeley is not lacking in homey cake shops but I feel like each one has their own speciality, so it really depends on your mood.Crixa has a modest menu and a distinctive Eastern European influence (they sell pierogies and kifli!). I've tried almost all their standard cakes and their crowning glory has to be their tiramisu. The sponge cake is always perfectly moist and rich with espresso flavors, while the mascarpone is airy, light, and never too sweet. I'm partial to their Soprano version which is made with a layer of their smoky dark chocolate. I also recently tried their vanilla bizet, which is like a pavlova, all ethereal and Christmas white. The meringue base was firm yet dissolved into perfect flaky sweetness once I bit into it and the vanilla cream was exquisite and again, not too sweet. Truly a local's delight and one that I hope continue to flourish in Berkeley for years to come!"
406,"Crixa is both great and terrible. Great because of their food and coffee, terrible because of their hours and...while not terrible, the ladies behind the counter are always brusque and don't have any time for your shit. Get it together, this is a business.Crixa is totally open during the week when no one buys cake at 2 PM on a Thursday, but not on Sundays. So go on a Saturday. But do go early, because they will run out of stuff and they won't be sorry about it. They'll tell you that you should've come earlier. The bizet and ginger cake are two of our favorites, and their coffee is quite good. The coffee is pricey, but you're also shelling out $4.50 for a pastry, so go big or go home.They do have limited outdoor seating, but beware if it's sunny outside--the tables are metal and will burn your skin off. The good: delicious pastries.The bad: hours could be better."
407,"This place has the best baked goods in the Bay Area, possibly the North American continent, and maybe the world (outside of France)! Yeah, I love them! Forget tartine, or any of the other bakeries, they can't compare. I drive 2.5 hours, 2-3 times a month to get their cakes. One of my favorite things about it is that the cakes are sooo good, and the guys there are true to their Hungarian roots :) reserved and professional without any of the fake American friendliness! Win-win- I don't have to fake smile, I just get to honestly smile at them because I am glad to see them and their wonderful cakes! Btw, it would be six stars, if it were an option."
408,"Soooooo rude. Both women didn't say a single word to me. I asked for what I wanted and the lady rang up my order and just said the total while the other boxed up the dessert. The lady at the register turned the screen toward me to sign the screen. After I signed my signature she handed me my card and I said ""Thank you"".  In a low voice she said ""thank you"". If I didn't say anything she wouldn't have said anything to me. There was no greeting, or can I help you, nothing from either of the two. They seemed like they were miserable and I must have been bothering them. Why would anyone want to pay someone to treat them like that? 1st and last time ever going there. Beware if you want to be treated like a paying customer that is appreciated and supporting their business. If it doesn't matter to you then stop by for the slim pickings of variety."
409,"You know how good this place is? So good I couldn't wait to write a review. I seriously took 2 bites out of my tiramisu cake and 2 from my coconut cake and just HAD to write it right now [with my cake beside me.] I am in heaven.Coconut cake: Nice and moist with just the right amount of coconut! It does not have an overwhelming amount of coconut flavor or cream. I am definitely a fan.Tiramisu: Perfection! It's not often you come across great tiramisu so I was just blown away at the perfection of Crixa's. It is perfectly moist and the filling was on point with the right amount of expresso flavor. I am definitely a fan of this place as I'm sure you can tell. I was pretty shocked to see all my coworkers getting seconds as well! Typically for any sweets, I don't see many grabbing seconds. This time I saw them grabbing seconds and debating what to get as their third!  Where have you guys been in my life!"
410,"Amazing cakes, awful service. What a bummer because this place otherwise deserves 5 stars without a doubt.Came here to pick up my Dad's bday cake that my sister pre-ordered and paid over the phone. When I walked into the store, the employee looked at me with a very unamused look. I told her that I was here to pick up a cake, and showed her the receipt that my sister said they instructed us to do. She responded, ""Just tell me the name."" very bluntly with a rude untertone.After, I asked her for a bag and explained that I had to walk to the BART station and then take the train home. It was Friday, so I knew the trains would be busy. She told flattly told me they were $0.30, and when I asked if I could pay with card, she said no then quickly put it away. I then had to hold the cake very still on my hour and a half commute from the store. Afterwards, I told my sister my experience and she confirmed that they were a piece of work on the phone too.However, once we finally dug into the cake, I gotta admit it was AMAZING! We got the Amaretti, and wow. The cake itself was very fluffy and moist. The cream was devine! And the little bits on top, not exactly sure what they were, but they gave it a perfect yet slight crunch.All in all, I'm just kind of surprised with Crixa's. Why wouldn't you treat customers kindly? As someone that has worked as a server, I understand that food may be good but customer service is what makes people loyal - it goes hand and hand! Crixa's is delicious, but don't come here if you're expecting the full experience that includes both delicious food and amazing service. I would honestly rather spend my money at a place that would happily do both, considering this small cake was $28."
411,"After walking up to Summer Kitchen and Bake Shop but finding out their pastry chef had left so they had no cookies, cakes, etc. I headed towards the next Berkeley bakery on my list - Crixa.  Honestly, I was a bit unsure exactly what a Russian bakery would be like but turns out its pretty much like any other bakery :)  The amaretto cake was as good as the other reviewers suggest and it almost melts in your mouth.  I also tried the apple cake (with whipped cream on the side) and that was pretty good, but not as sweet as I would have liked (though the cashier warned me about that upfront).  Overall, a great experience and I was particularly surprised/delighted by how many different types of cakes, pies, and tarts they have - at least a dozen or so different flavors (though many of them were sold out by the time I got there)."
412,My favorite dessert place within walking distance! Love their flourless chocolate cake
413,"A couple of my friends have raved about this bakery and I can see why!The cakes, though a bit pricey, are worth every dollar. The cakes I have tried have all been moist and delicious. It really annoys me when frosting on cakes is too sweet, and Crixa nails the sugar ratio. My favorite cake here has to be the jamaican rum chocolate mousse cake. This cake is absolutely delicious. The rum isn't lost in the baking, as the cake is soaked, making for a really delicious cake."
414,I lived in Germany for many years and travelled through Central Europe. Crixa sort of ruined it for me because I thought I'd had the best Central European pastries around. After going to crixa I returned to Central Europe and dined in the finest coffeehouses where all the great cultural people did their culture and i felt a deep sorrow. How can crixa be the best? Berkeley continues its food domination. I hope this place doesn't get too popular because it's like the secret came out.
415,"Nice little coffee shop. Clean with a welcoming, funky decor. Very friendly and helpful staff. Fair prices.Good espresso. Loved the tres leches cake. Great place to get a slice of cake and a good cup of coffee."
416,"Best sour cherry pie I've ever had- looking forward to a return visit next week.Decor is reminiscent of a European cafe, quaint and charming."
417,"The flourless chocolate cake and poppy seed rugelah are not to be missed. The cake, in particular, was beautifully chocolatey with a lovely light texture. We also tried the ginger round, which was fine, but nothing to write home about. Loved the other two items and will be back for a slice of the pear and rose cream tarte!"
418,"I had heard about this place and from the Yelp reviews was really looking forward to a Boston Cream cake.  Alas, we arrived on a Saturday after 2pm and there wasn't much selection at all.  I selected a slice of the Florio cake, as the almond/raspberry combo sounded good to me but I was a little skeptical about the rose flavored creme, as I generally don't like flowery flavors (teas, etc).I must admit I was pleasantly surprised and I really enjoyed this cake.  The flavors and textures blended very nicely- creamy, crunchy, the rose flavor very subtle.  Definitely a quality cake but a bit of a splurge ($5.45/slice).  Not something I'd buy every day for that price but you get what you pay for!  Can't wait to try the Boston Creme next time, I'll have to get there in the morning!"
419,"I have enjoyed both cakes and pies from Crixa. All products I have tried were excellent. The ingredients were fresh , moist and well prepared.It has become my go to bakery. Accordingly I would recommend this bakery as one of the best in the Bay areao"
420,"Perfect amount of sweetness that's light fluff cakes (if that makes any sense) Seriously one of my favorite places to come when I have a sweet tooth! I love everything they bake here but my favorite has to be the Amaretto, Strawberry cream and the flourless chocolate. Highly recommend coming early because they do tend to run out quick of the good stuff. Pricing is definitely on the high side so if you aren't trying to break the bank on small pieces of cake, you might not want to come because the average slice is over $5."
421,"*Little slice of Hungarian paradise*Apparently this place has been here since 1998. Weird- because I've never noticed it in the neighborhood.

I love the vanilla flavor, smoooooth cream, soft moist fluffy cake, and the added crunch of the crushed crackers on top.  I'll definitely be back to try more things!"
444,The tiramisu with dark chocolate mousse is to.die.for.
445,"I've been coming here for years but keep forgetting to leave a review. As an undergrad I would go dessert hopping whenever I wanted to treat myself and hit up a bunch of bakeries and gorge (La Farine, Crixa, and Katrina Rozelle). Berkeley is not lacking in homey cake shops but I feel like each one has their own speciality, so it really depends on your mood.Crixa has a modest menu and a distinctive Eastern European influence (they sell pierogies and kifli!). I've tried almost all their standard cakes and their crowning glory has to be their tiramisu. The sponge cake is always perfectly moist and rich with espresso flavors, while the mascarpone is airy, light, and never too sweet. I'm partial to their Soprano version which is made with a layer of their smoky dark chocolate. I also recently tried their vanilla bizet, which is like a pavlova, all ethereal and Christmas white. The meringue base was firm yet dissolved into perfect flaky sweetness once I bit into it and the vanilla cream was exquisite and again, not too sweet. Truly a local's delight and one that I hope continue to flourish in Berkeley for years to come!"
446,"Crixa is both great and terrible. Great because of their food and coffee, terrible because of their hours and...while not terrible, the ladies behind the counter are always brusque and don't have any time for your shit. Get it together, this is a business.Crixa is totally open during the week when no one buys cake at 2 PM on a Thursday, but not on Sundays. So go on a Saturday. But do go early, because they will run out of stuff and they won't be sorry about it. They'll tell you that you should've come earlier. The bizet and ginger cake are two of our favorites, and their coffee is quite good. The coffee is pricey, but you're also shelling out $4.50 for a pastry, so go big or go home.They do have limited outdoor seating, but beware if it's sunny outside--the tables are metal and will burn your skin off. The good: delicious pastries.The bad: hours could be better."
447,"This place has the best baked goods in the Bay Area, possibly the North American continent, and maybe the world (outside of France)! Yeah, I love them! Forget tartine, or any of the other bakeries, they can't compare. I drive 2.5 hours, 2-3 times a month to get their cakes. One of my favorite things about it is that the cakes are sooo good, and the guys there are true to their Hungarian roots :) reserved and professional without any of the fake American friendliness! Win-win- I don't have to fake smile, I just get to honestly smile at them because I am glad to see them and their wonderful cakes! Btw, it would be six stars, if it were an option."
448,"Soooooo rude. Both women didn't say a single word to me. I asked for what I wanted and the lady rang up my order and just said the total while the other boxed up the dessert. The lady at the register turned the screen toward me to sign the screen. After I signed my signature she handed me my card and I said ""Thank you"".  In a low voice she said ""thank you"". If I didn't say anything she wouldn't have said anything to me. There was no greeting, or can I help you, nothing from either of the two. They seemed like they were miserable and I must have been bothering them. Why would anyone want to pay someone to treat them like that? 1st and last time ever going there. Beware if you want to be treated like a paying customer that is appreciated and supporting their business. If it doesn't matter to you then stop by for the slim pickings of variety."
449,"You know how good this place is? So good I couldn't wait to write a review. I seriously took 2 bites out of my tiramisu cake and 2 from my coconut cake and just HAD to write it right now [with my cake beside me.] I am in heaven.Coconut cake: Nice and moist with just the right amount of coconut! It does not have an overwhelming amount of coconut flavor or cream. I am definitely a fan.Tiramisu: Perfection! It's not often you come across great tiramisu so I was just blown away at the perfection of Crixa's. It is perfectly moist and the filling was on point with the right amount of expresso flavor. I am definitely a fan of this place as I'm sure you can tell. I was pretty shocked to see all my coworkers getting seconds as well! Typically for any sweets, I don't see many grabbing seconds. This time I saw them grabbing seconds and debating what to get as their third!  Where have you guys been in my life!"
450,"Amazing cakes, awful service. What a bummer because this place otherwise deserves 5 stars without a doubt.Came here to pick up my Dad's bday cake that my sister pre-ordered and paid over the phone. When I walked into the store, the employee looked at me with a very unamused look. I told her that I was here to pick up a cake, and showed her the receipt that my sister said they instructed us to do. She responded, ""Just tell me the name."" very bluntly with a rude untertone.After, I asked her for a bag and explained that I had to walk to the BART station and then take the train home. It was Friday, so I knew the trains would be busy. She told flattly told me they were $0.30, and when I asked if I could pay with card, she said no then quickly put it away. I then had to hold the cake very still on my hour and a half commute from the store. Afterwards, I told my sister my experience and she confirmed that they were a piece of work on the phone too.However, once we finally dug into the cake, I gotta admit it was AMAZING! We got the Amaretti, and wow. The cake itself was very fluffy and moist. The cream was devine! And the little bits on top, not exactly sure what they were, but they gave it a perfect yet slight crunch.All in all, I'm just kind of surprised with Crixa's. Why wouldn't you treat customers kindly? As someone that has worked as a server, I understand that food may be good but customer service is what makes people loyal - it goes hand and hand! Crixa's is delicious, but don't come here if you're expecting the full experience that includes both delicious food and amazing service. I would honestly rather spend my money at a place that would happily do both, considering this small cake was $28."
451,"After walking up to Summer Kitchen and Bake Shop but finding out their pastry chef had left so they had no cookies, cakes, etc. I headed towards the next Berkeley bakery on my list - Crixa.  Honestly, I was a bit unsure exactly what a Russian bakery would be like but turns out its pretty much like any other bakery :)  The amaretto cake was as good as the other reviewers suggest and it almost melts in your mouth.  I also tried the apple cake (with whipped cream on the side) and that was pretty good, but not as sweet as I would have liked (though the cashier warned me about that upfront).  Overall, a great experience and I was particularly surprised/delighted by how many different types of cakes, pies, and tarts they have - at least a dozen or so different flavors (though many of them were sold out by the time I got there)."
452,My favorite dessert place within walking distance! Love their flourless chocolate cake
453,"A couple of my friends have raved about this bakery and I can see why!The cakes, though a bit pricey, are worth every dollar. The cakes I have tried have all been moist and delicious. It really annoys me when frosting on cakes is too sweet, and Crixa nails the sugar ratio. My favorite cake here has to be the jamaican rum chocolate mousse cake. This cake is absolutely delicious. The rum isn't lost in the baking, as the cake is soaked, making for a really delicious cake."
454,I lived in Germany for many years and travelled through Central Europe. Crixa sort of ruined it for me because I thought I'd had the best Central European pastries around. After going to crixa I returned to Central Europe and dined in the finest coffeehouses where all the great cultural people did their culture and i felt a deep sorrow. How can crixa be the best? Berkeley continues its food domination. I hope this place doesn't get too popular because it's like the secret came out.
455,"Nice little coffee shop. Clean with a welcoming, funky decor. Very friendly and helpful staff. Fair prices.Good espresso. Loved the tres leches cake. Great place to get a slice of cake and a good cup of coffee."
456,"Best sour cherry pie I've ever had- looking forward to a return visit next week.Decor is reminiscent of a European cafe, quaint and charming."
457,"The flourless chocolate cake and poppy seed rugelah are not to be missed. The cake, in particular, was beautifully chocolatey with a lovely light texture. We also tried the ginger round, which was fine, but nothing to write home about. Loved the other two items and will be back for a slice of the pear and rose cream tarte!"
458,"I had heard about this place and from the Yelp reviews was really looking forward to a Boston Cream cake.  Alas, we arrived on a Saturday after 2pm and there wasn't much selection at all.  I selected a slice of the Florio cake, as the almond/raspberry combo sounded good to me but I was a little skeptical about the rose flavored creme, as I generally don't like flowery flavors (teas, etc).I must admit I was pleasantly surprised and I really enjoyed this cake.  The flavors and textures blended very nicely- creamy, crunchy, the rose flavor very subtle.  Definitely a quality cake but a bit of a splurge ($5.45/slice).  Not something I'd buy every day for that price but you get what you pay for!  Can't wait to try the Boston Creme next time, I'll have to get there in the morning!"
459,"I have enjoyed both cakes and pies from Crixa. All products I have tried were excellent. The ingredients were fresh , moist and well prepared.It has become my go to bakery. Accordingly I would recommend this bakery as one of the best in the Bay areao"
460,"Perfect amount of sweetness that's light fluff cakes (if that makes any sense) Seriously one of my favorite places to come when I have a sweet tooth! I love everything they bake here but my favorite has to be the Amaretto, Strawberry cream and the flourless chocolate. Highly recommend coming early because they do tend to run out quick of the good stuff. Pricing is definitely on the high side so if you aren't trying to break the bank on small pieces of cake, you might not want to come because the average slice is over $5."
461,"*Little slice of Hungarian paradise*Apparently this place has been here since 1998. Weird- because I've never noticed it in the neighborhood. Swear my little piggy self noticed & STOPPED by  EVERY sweet shop between my granny's house (insert image of little red riding hood.. except .. I'm clearly brown) and UC Berkeley (back when I took summer classes there Circa '2002ish)WhatevsThis place is so cool. Glad my friend's bf recommended this spot.They have class, culture, cute decorations and the most delicious sweets ever . Not to mention their espresso is pretty decent annnnd they have the most adorable Short coffee cups to go. (Toddler size)So I stopped by around 5:00 & they close at 5:30 on a Tuesday. They were extremely patient and not rushing to clean up- which is nice (hate walking into a store that closes in 1 hour and they're cleaning up).I recommend their almond cream cake which was so dang moist and light as a feather ($5ish). If you like white cake with a slight nut flavor- you'll go for this, and I do mean SLIGHT. It was so good and light I finished the cake on autopilot in 2.2 seconds. Other tasty treats : tiramisu, their seasonal strawberry cake and this awesome looking chocolate cream cakeNotes:- great shaded parking out front - chill location- apparently hecka Hungarians show up on Saturday's which is cool if you identify with that culture - patient staff  - all cakes cost around $5/$5.50"
462,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while particularly for their Amaretti cake, Tiramisu, and Boston Creme pies. HoweverI've never been able to make it here during the weekdays since they close at 5:30, so I decided to test my luck coming here on a Saturday at around 2PM (they close at 4).Much like what others have echoed, definitely come here early because the assortment you can chose from dwindles down. Luckily there were still a few slices of the Amaretti cake, but I think the other things I came to try were already sold out. They also have a few items in a separate display case by the register away from the cake display so be sure to check those items out. LOCATION: Right on Shattuck there is some street parking near this location but I think it's easier to walk from BART or bus to. They have seating inside for those who want coffee and even a few tables outside that they also bus.FOOD: $5 a slice is pricey for me, but one time for the one time right. The Amaretti cake was definitely worth the walk and I'm not a huge cake fan! The cake was moist, the cream light/airy, and overall sweet but not too sweet. The added cookies on top made for a great change in texture and sweetness to the cake. Even though I finished a slice myself, I didn't feel like I got cavities while doing so (well I hope not. haha). SERVICE: I only came here to get a cake to-go so I can't really comment on the sentiments of other Yelpers about the service. The service was friendly and greeted me right when I walked through the door, but to be honest I did feel a little rushed even though there was nobody behind me. Luckily I already knew what I wanted but I can only imagine how it would be if you had no idea. CONS: I couldn't give it 5 stars for these reasons - Hours - Limited assortment later in the day"
463,"Soft, delectable, moist cakes, the ~$5 slices of cakes here are totally worth a trip! Many Yelpers have mentioned that the ladies here aren't so friendly and that the cakes do sell out as the day goes on, so be sure to come earlier and check their website to see what delicious baked goods they're selling each day. I also found the ladies here to be pretty friendly! Anyways, the cake. I got:1) Tiramisu (5/5) - Definitely one of the best tiramisu I've enjoyed. The cake itself is so moist, and majorly soaked in coffee, contributing to the overall softness of this cake. The cream is whipped to perfect smoothness, and the flavor of this cake is absolutely delicious. Though the slice isn't that big for ~$5, I would say it's such a rich (though not heavy) dessert that the slice is a good size!2) Amaretti (5/5) - I think I love this cake more than the tiramisu.

If I didn't say anything she wouldn't have said anything to me. There was no greeting, or can I help you, nothing from either of the two. They seemed like they were miserable and I must have been bothering them. Why would anyone want to pay someone to treat them like that? 1st and last time ever going there. Beware if you want to be treated like a paying customer that is appreciated and supporting their business. If it doesn't matter to you then stop by for the slim pickings of variety."
489,"You know how good this place is? So good I couldn't wait to write a review. I seriously took 2 bites out of my tiramisu cake and 2 from my coconut cake and just HAD to write it right now [with my cake beside me.] I am in heaven.Coconut cake: Nice and moist with just the right amount of coconut! It does not have an overwhelming amount of coconut flavor or cream. I am definitely a fan.Tiramisu: Perfection! It's not often you come across great tiramisu so I was just blown away at the perfection of Crixa's. It is perfectly moist and the filling was on point with the right amount of expresso flavor. I am definitely a fan of this place as I'm sure you can tell. I was pretty shocked to see all my coworkers getting seconds as well! Typically for any sweets, I don't see many grabbing seconds. This time I saw them grabbing seconds and debating what to get as their third!  Where have you guys been in my life!"
490,"Amazing cakes, awful service. What a bummer because this place otherwise deserves 5 stars without a doubt.Came here to pick up my Dad's bday cake that my sister pre-ordered and paid over the phone. When I walked into the store, the employee looked at me with a very unamused look. I told her that I was here to pick up a cake, and showed her the receipt that my sister said they instructed us to do. She responded, ""Just tell me the name."" very bluntly with a rude untertone.After, I asked her for a bag and explained that I had to walk to the BART station and then take the train home. It was Friday, so I knew the trains would be busy. She told flattly told me they were $0.30, and when I asked if I could pay with card, she said no then quickly put it away. I then had to hold the cake very still on my hour and a half commute from the store. Afterwards, I told my sister my experience and she confirmed that they were a piece of work on the phone too.However, once we finally dug into the cake, I gotta admit it was AMAZING! We got the Amaretti, and wow. The cake itself was very fluffy and moist. The cream was devine! And the little bits on top, not exactly sure what they were, but they gave it a perfect yet slight crunch.All in all, I'm just kind of surprised with Crixa's. Why wouldn't you treat customers kindly? As someone that has worked as a server, I understand that food may be good but customer service is what makes people loyal - it goes hand and hand! Crixa's is delicious, but don't come here if you're expecting the full experience that includes both delicious food and amazing service. I would honestly rather spend my money at a place that would happily do both, considering this small cake was $28."
491,"After walking up to Summer Kitchen and Bake Shop but finding out their pastry chef had left so they had no cookies, cakes, etc. I headed towards the next Berkeley bakery on my list - Crixa.  Honestly, I was a bit unsure exactly what a Russian bakery would be like but turns out its pretty much like any other bakery :)  The amaretto cake was as good as the other reviewers suggest and it almost melts in your mouth.  I also tried the apple cake (with whipped cream on the side) and that was pretty good, but not as sweet as I would have liked (though the cashier warned me about that upfront).  Overall, a great experience and I was particularly surprised/delighted by how many different types of cakes, pies, and tarts they have - at least a dozen or so different flavors (though many of them were sold out by the time I got there)."
492,My favorite dessert place within walking distance! Love their flourless chocolate cake
493,"A couple of my friends have raved about this bakery and I can see why!The cakes, though a bit pricey, are worth every dollar. The cakes I have tried have all been moist and delicious. It really annoys me when frosting on cakes is too sweet, and Crixa nails the sugar ratio. My favorite cake here has to be the jamaican rum chocolate mousse cake. This cake is absolutely delicious. The rum isn't lost in the baking, as the cake is soaked, making for a really delicious cake."
494,I lived in Germany for many years and travelled through Central Europe. Crixa sort of ruined it for me because I thought I'd had the best Central European pastries around. After going to crixa I returned to Central Europe and dined in the finest coffeehouses where all the great cultural people did their culture and i felt a deep sorrow. How can crixa be the best? Berkeley continues its food domination. I hope this place doesn't get too popular because it's like the secret came out.
495,"Nice little coffee shop. Clean with a welcoming, funky decor. Very friendly and helpful staff. Fair prices.Good espresso. Loved the tres leches cake. Great place to get a slice of cake and a good cup of coffee."
496,"Best sour cherry pie I've ever had- looking forward to a return visit next week.Decor is reminiscent of a European cafe, quaint and charming."
497,"The flourless chocolate cake and poppy seed rugelah are not to be missed. The cake, in particular, was beautifully chocolatey with a lovely light texture. We also tried the ginger round, which was fine, but nothing to write home about. Loved the other two items and will be back for a slice of the pear and rose cream tarte!"
498,"I had heard about this place and from the Yelp reviews was really looking forward to a Boston Cream cake.  Alas, we arrived on a Saturday after 2pm and there wasn't much selection at all.  I selected a slice of the Florio cake, as the almond/raspberry combo sounded good to me but I was a little skeptical about the rose flavored creme, as I generally don't like flowery flavors (teas, etc).I must admit I was pleasantly surprised and I really enjoyed this cake.  The flavors and textures blended very nicely- creamy, crunchy, the rose flavor very subtle.  Definitely a quality cake but a bit of a splurge ($5.45/slice).  Not something I'd buy every day for that price but you get what you pay for!  Can't wait to try the Boston Creme next time, I'll have to get there in the morning!"
499,"I have enjoyed both cakes and pies from Crixa. All products I have tried were excellent. The ingredients were fresh , moist and well prepared.It has become my go to bakery. Accordingly I would recommend this bakery as one of the best in the Bay areao"
500,"Perfect amount of sweetness that's light fluff cakes (if that makes any sense) Seriously one of my favorite places to come when I have a sweet tooth! I love everything they bake here but my favorite has to be the Amaretto, Strawberry cream and the flourless chocolate. Highly recommend coming early because they do tend to run out quick of the good stuff. Pricing is definitely on the high side so if you aren't trying to break the bank on small pieces of cake, you might not want to come because the average slice is over $5."
501,"*Little slice of Hungarian paradise*Apparently this place has been here since 1998. Weird- because I've never noticed it in the neighborhood. Swear my little piggy self noticed & STOPPED by  EVERY sweet shop between my granny's house (insert image of little red riding hood.. except .. I'm clearly brown) and UC Berkeley (back when I took summer classes there Circa '2002ish)WhatevsThis place is so cool. Glad my friend's bf recommended this spot.They have class, culture, cute decorations and the most delicious sweets ever . Not to mention their espresso is pretty decent annnnd they have the most adorable Short coffee cups to go. (Toddler size)So I stopped by around 5:00 & they close at 5:30 on a Tuesday. They were extremely patient and not rushing to clean up- which is nice (hate walking into a store that closes in 1 hour and they're cleaning up).I recommend their almond cream cake which was so dang moist and light as a feather ($5ish). If you like white cake with a slight nut flavor- you'll go for this, and I do mean SLIGHT. It was so good and light I finished the cake on autopilot in 2.2 seconds. Other tasty treats : tiramisu, their seasonal strawberry cake and this awesome looking chocolate cream cakeNotes:- great shaded parking out front - chill location- apparently hecka Hungarians show up on Saturday's which is cool if you identify with that culture - patient staff  - all cakes cost around $5/$5.50"
502,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while particularly for their Amaretti cake, Tiramisu, and Boston Creme pies. HoweverI've never been able to make it here during the weekdays since they close at 5:30, so I decided to test my luck coming here on a Saturday at around 2PM (they close at 4).Much like what others have echoed, definitely come here early because the assortment you can chose from dwindles down. Luckily there were still a few slices of the Amaretti cake, but I think the other things I came to try were already sold out. They also have a few items in a separate display case by the register away from the cake display so be sure to check those items out. LOCATION: Right on Shattuck there is some street parking near this location but I think it's easier to walk from BART or bus to. They have seating inside for those who want coffee and even a few tables outside that they also bus.FOOD: $5 a slice is pricey for me, but one time for the one time right. The Amaretti cake was definitely worth the walk and I'm not a huge cake fan! The cake was moist, the cream light/airy, and overall sweet but not too sweet. The added cookies on top made for a great change in texture and sweetness to the cake. Even though I finished a slice myself, I didn't feel like I got cavities while doing so (well I hope not. haha). SERVICE: I only came here to get a cake to-go so I can't really comment on the sentiments of other Yelpers about the service. The service was friendly and greeted me right when I walked through the door, but to be honest I did feel a little rushed even though there was nobody behind me. Luckily I already knew what I wanted but I can only imagine how it would be if you had no idea. CONS: I couldn't give it 5 stars for these reasons - Hours - Limited assortment later in the day"
503,"Soft, delectable, moist cakes, the ~$5 slices of cakes here are totally worth a trip! Many Yelpers have mentioned that the ladies here aren't so friendly and that the cakes do sell out as the day goes on, so be sure to come earlier and check their website to see what delicious baked goods they're selling each day. I also found the ladies here to be pretty friendly! Anyways, the cake. I got:1) Tiramisu (5/5) - Definitely one of the best tiramisu I've enjoyed. The cake itself is so moist, and majorly soaked in coffee, contributing to the overall softness of this cake. The cream is whipped to perfect smoothness, and the flavor of this cake is absolutely delicious. Though the slice isn't that big for ~$5, I would say it's such a rich (though not heavy) dessert that the slice is a good size!2) Amaretti (5/5) - I think I love this cake more than the tiramisu. I love the vanilla flavor, smoooooth cream, soft moist fluffy cake, and the added crunch of the crushed crackers on top.  I'll definitely be back to try more things!"
504,The tiramisu with dark chocolate mousse is to.die.for.
505,"I've been coming here for years but keep forgetting to leave a review. As an undergrad I would go dessert hopping whenever I wanted to treat myself and hit up a bunch of bakeries and gorge (La Farine, Crixa, and Katrina Rozelle). Berkeley is not lacking in homey cake shops but I feel like each one has their own speciality, so it really depends on your mood.Crixa has a modest menu and a distinctive Eastern European influence (they sell pierogies and kifli!). I've tried almost all their standard cakes and their crowning glory has to be their tiramisu. The sponge cake is always perfectly moist and rich with espresso flavors, while the mascarpone is airy, light, and never too sweet. I'm partial to their Soprano version which is made with a layer of their smoky dark chocolate. I also recently tried their vanilla bizet, which is like a pavlova, all ethereal and Christmas white. The meringue base was firm yet dissolved into perfect flaky sweetness once I bit into it and the vanilla cream was exquisite and again, not too sweet. Truly a local's delight and one that I hope continue to flourish in Berkeley for years to come!"
506,"Crixa is both great and terrible. Great because of their food and coffee, terrible because of their hours and...while not terrible, the ladies behind the counter are always brusque and don't have any time for your shit. Get it together, this is a business.Crixa is totally open during the week when no one buys cake at 2 PM on a Thursday, but not on Sundays. So go on a Saturday. But do go early, because they will run out of stuff and they won't be sorry about it. They'll tell you that you should've come earlier. The bizet and ginger cake are two of our favorites, and their coffee is quite good. The coffee is pricey, but you're also shelling out $4.50 for a pastry, so go big or go home.They do have limited outdoor seating, but beware if it's sunny outside--the tables are metal and will burn your skin off. The good: delicious pastries.The bad: hours could be better."
507,"This place has the best baked goods in the Bay Area, possibly the North American continent, and maybe the world (outside of France)! Yeah, I love them! Forget tartine, or any of the other bakeries, they can't compare. I drive 2.5 hours, 2-3 times a month to get their cakes. One of my favorite things about it is that the cakes are sooo good, and the guys there are true to their Hungarian roots :) reserved and professional without any of the fake American friendliness! Win-win- I don't have to fake smile, I just get to honestly smile at them because I am glad to see them and their wonderful cakes! Btw, it would be six stars, if it were an option."

531,"After walking up to Summer Kitchen and Bake Shop but finding out their pastry chef had left so they had no cookies, cakes, etc. I headed towards the next Berkeley bakery on my list - Crixa.  Honestly, I was a bit unsure exactly what a Russian bakery would be like but turns out its pretty much like any other bakery :)  The amaretto cake was as good as the other reviewers suggest and it almost melts in your mouth.  I also tried the apple cake (with whipped cream on the side) and that was pretty good, but not as sweet as I would have liked (though the cashier warned me about that upfront).  Overall, a great experience and I was particularly surprised/delighted by how many different types of cakes, pies, and tarts they have - at least a dozen or so different flavors (though many of them were sold out by the time I got there)."
532,My favorite dessert place within walking distance! Love their flourless chocolate cake
533,"A couple of my friends have raved about this bakery and I can see why!The cakes, though a bit pricey, are worth every dollar. The cakes I have tried have all been moist and delicious. It really annoys me when frosting on cakes is too sweet, and Crixa nails the sugar ratio. My favorite cake here has to be the jamaican rum chocolate mousse cake. This cake is absolutely delicious. The rum isn't lost in the baking, as the cake is soaked, making for a really delicious cake."
534,I lived in Germany for many years and travelled through Central Europe. Crixa sort of ruined it for me because I thought I'd had the best Central European pastries around. After going to crixa I returned to Central Europe and dined in the finest coffeehouses where all the great cultural people did their culture and i felt a deep sorrow. How can crixa be the best? Berkeley continues its food domination. I hope this place doesn't get too popular because it's like the secret came out.
535,"Nice little coffee shop. Clean with a welcoming, funky decor. Very friendly and helpful staff. Fair prices.Good espresso. Loved the tres leches cake. Great place to get a slice of cake and a good cup of coffee."
536,"Best sour cherry pie I've ever had- looking forward to a return visit next week.Decor is reminiscent of a European cafe, quaint and charming."
537,"The flourless chocolate cake and poppy seed rugelah are not to be missed. The cake, in particular, was beautifully chocolatey with a lovely light texture. We also tried the ginger round, which was fine, but nothing to write home about. Loved the other two items and will be back for a slice of the pear and rose cream tarte!"
538,"I had heard about this place and from the Yelp reviews was really looking forward to a Boston Cream cake.  Alas, we arrived on a Saturday after 2pm and there wasn't much selection at all.  I selected a slice of the Florio cake, as the almond/raspberry combo sounded good to me but I was a little skeptical about the rose flavored creme, as I generally don't like flowery flavors (teas, etc).I must admit I was pleasantly surprised and I really enjoyed this cake.  The flavors and textures blended very nicely- creamy, crunchy, the rose flavor very subtle.  Definitely a quality cake but a bit of a splurge ($5.45/slice).  Not something I'd buy every day for that price but you get what you pay for!  Can't wait to try the Boston Creme next time, I'll have to get there in the morning!"
539,"I have enjoyed both cakes and pies from Crixa. All products I have tried were excellent. The ingredients were fresh , moist and well prepared.It has become my go to bakery. Accordingly I would recommend this bakery as one of the best in the Bay areao"
540,"Perfect amount of sweetness that's light fluff cakes (if that makes any sense) Seriously one of my favorite places to come when I have a sweet tooth! I love everything they bake here but my favorite has to be the Amaretto, Strawberry cream and the flourless chocolate. Highly recommend coming early because they do tend to run out quick of the good stuff. Pricing is definitely on the high side so if you aren't trying to break the bank on small pieces of cake, you might not want to come because the average slice is over $5."
541,"*Little slice of Hungarian paradise*Apparently this place has been here since 1998. Weird- because I've never noticed it in the neighborhood. Swear my little piggy self noticed & STOPPED by  EVERY sweet shop between my granny's house (insert image of little red riding hood.. except .. I'm clearly brown) and UC Berkeley (back when I took summer classes there Circa '2002ish)WhatevsThis place is so cool. Glad my friend's bf recommended this spot.They have class, culture, cute decorations and the most delicious sweets ever . Not to mention their espresso is pretty decent annnnd they have the most adorable Short coffee cups to go. (Toddler size)So I stopped by around 5:00 & they close at 5:30 on a Tuesday. They were extremely patient and not rushing to clean up- which is nice (hate walking into a store that closes in 1 hour and they're cleaning up).I recommend their almond cream cake which was so dang moist and light as a feather ($5ish). If you like white cake with a slight nut flavor- you'll go for this, and I do mean SLIGHT. It was so good and light I finished the cake on autopilot in 2.2 seconds. Other tasty treats : tiramisu, their seasonal strawberry cake and this awesome looking chocolate cream cakeNotes:- great shaded parking out front - chill location- apparently hecka Hungarians show up on Saturday's which is cool if you identify with that culture - patient staff  - all cakes cost around $5/$5.50"
542,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while particularly for their Amaretti cake, Tiramisu, and Boston Creme pies. HoweverI've never been able to make it here during the weekdays since they close at 5:30, so I decided to test my luck coming here on a Saturday at around 2PM (they close at 4).Much like what others have echoed, definitely come here early because the assortment you can chose from dwindles down. Luckily there were still a few slices of the Amaretti cake, but I think the other things I came to try were already sold out. They also have a few items in a separate display case by the register away from the cake display so be sure to check those items out. LOCATION: Right on Shattuck there is some street parking near this location but I think it's easier to walk from BART or bus to. They have seating inside for those who want coffee and even a few tables outside that they also bus.FOOD: $5 a slice is pricey for me, but one time for the one time right. The Amaretti cake was definitely worth the walk and I'm not a huge cake fan! The cake was moist, the cream light/airy, and overall sweet but not too sweet. The added cookies on top made for a great change in texture and sweetness to the cake. Even though I finished a slice myself, I didn't feel like I got cavities while doing so (well I hope not. haha). SERVICE: I only came here to get a cake to-go so I can't really comment on the sentiments of other Yelpers about the service. The service was friendly and greeted me right when I walked through the door, but to be honest I did feel a little rushed even though there was nobody behind me. Luckily I already knew what I wanted but I can only imagine how it would be if you had no idea. CONS: I couldn't give it 5 stars for these reasons - Hours - Limited assortment later in the day"
543,"Soft, delectable, moist cakes, the ~$5 slices of cakes here are totally worth a trip! Many Yelpers have mentioned that the ladies here aren't so friendly and that the cakes do sell out as the day goes on, so be sure to come earlier and check their website to see what delicious baked goods they're selling each day. I also found the ladies here to be pretty friendly! Anyways, the cake. I got:1) Tiramisu (5/5) - Definitely one of the best tiramisu I've enjoyed. The cake itself is so moist, and majorly soaked in coffee, contributing to the overall softness of this cake. The cream is whipped to perfect smoothness, and the flavor of this cake is absolutely delicious. Though the slice isn't that big for ~$5, I would say it's such a rich (though not heavy) dessert that the slice is a good size!2) Amaretti (5/5) - I think I love this cake more than the tiramisu. I love the vanilla flavor, smoooooth cream, soft moist fluffy cake, and the added crunch of the crushed crackers on top.  I'll definitely be back to try more things!"
544,The tiramisu with dark chocolate mousse is to.die.for.
545,"I've been coming here for years but keep forgetting to leave a review. As an undergrad I would go dessert hopping whenever I wanted to treat myself and hit up a bunch of bakeries and gorge (La Farine, Crixa, and Katrina Rozelle). Berkeley is not lacking in homey cake shops but I feel like each one has their own speciality, so it really depends on your mood.Crixa has a modest menu and a distinctive Eastern European influence (they sell pierogies and kifli!). I've tried almost all their standard cakes and their crowning glory has to be their tiramisu. The sponge cake is always perfectly moist and rich with espresso flavors, while the mascarpone is airy, light, and never too sweet. I'm partial to their Soprano version which is made with a layer of their smoky dark chocolate. I also recently tried their vanilla bizet, which is like a pavlova, all ethereal and Christmas white. The meringue base was firm yet dissolved into perfect flaky sweetness once I bit into it and the vanilla cream was exquisite and again, not too sweet. Truly a local's delight and one that I hope continue to flourish in Berkeley for years to come!"
546,"Crixa is both great and terrible. Great because of their food and coffee, terrible because of their hours and...while not terrible, the ladies behind the counter are always brusque and don't have any time for your shit. Get it together, this is a business.Crixa is totally open during the week when no one buys cake at 2 PM on a Thursday, but not on Sundays. So go on a Saturday. But do go early, because they will run out of stuff and they won't be sorry about it. They'll tell you that you should've come earlier. The bizet and ginger cake are two of our favorites, and their coffee is quite good. The coffee is pricey, but you're also shelling out $4.50 for a pastry, so go big or go home.They do have limited outdoor seating, but beware if it's sunny outside--the tables are metal and will burn your skin off. The good: delicious pastries.The bad: hours could be better."
547,"This place has the best baked goods in the Bay Area, possibly the North American continent, and maybe the world (outside of France)! Yeah, I love them! Forget tartine, or any of the other bakeries, they can't compare. I drive 2.5 hours, 2-3 times a month to get their cakes. One of my favorite things about it is that the cakes are sooo good, and the guys there are true to their Hungarian roots :) reserved and professional without any of the fake American friendliness! Win-win- I don't have to fake smile, I just get to honestly smile at them because I am glad to see them and their wonderful cakes! Btw, it would be six stars, if it were an option."
548,"Soooooo rude. Both women didn't say a single word to me. I asked for what I wanted and the lady rang up my order and just said the total while the other boxed up the dessert. The lady at the register turned the screen toward me to sign the screen. After I signed my signature she handed me my card and I said ""Thank you"".  In a low voice she said ""thank you"". If I didn't say anything she wouldn't have said anything to me. There was no greeting, or can I help you, nothing from either of the two. They seemed like they were miserable and I must have been bothering them. Why would anyone want to pay someone to treat them like that? 1st and last time ever going there. Beware if you want to be treated like a paying customer that is appreciated and supporting their business. If it doesn't matter to you then stop by for the slim pickings of variety."
549,"You know how good this place is? So good I couldn't wait to write a review. I seriously took 2 bites out of my tiramisu cake and 2 from my coconut cake and just HAD to write it right now [with my cake beside me.] I am in heaven.Coconut cake: Nice and moist with just the right amount of coconut! It does not have an overwhelming amount of coconut flavor or cream. I am definitely a fan.Tiramisu: Perfection! It's not often you come across great tiramisu so I was just blown away at the perfection of Crixa's. It is perfectly moist and the filling was on point with the right amount of expresso flavor. I am definitely a fan of this place as I'm sure you can tell. I was pretty shocked to see all my coworkers getting seconds as well! Typically for any sweets, I don't see many grabbing seconds. This time I saw them grabbing seconds and debating what to get as their third!  Where have you guys been in my life!"
550,"Amazing cakes, awful service. What a bummer because this place otherwise deserves 5 stars without a doubt.Came here to pick up my Dad's bday cake that my sister pre-ordered and paid over the phone. When I walked into the store, the employee looked at me with a very unamused look. I told her that I was here to pick up a cake, and showed her the receipt that my sister said they instructed us to do. She responded, ""Just tell me the name."" very bluntly with a rude untertone.After, I asked her for a bag and explained that I had to walk to the BART station and then take the train home. It was Friday, so I knew the trains would be busy. She told flattly told me they were $0.30, and when I asked if I could pay with card, she said no then quickly put it away. I then had to hold the cake very still on my hour and a half commute from the store. Afterwards, I told my sister my experience and she confirmed that they were a piece of work on the phone too.However, once we finally dug into the cake, I gotta admit it was AMAZING! We got the Amaretti, and wow. The cake itself was very fluffy and moist. The cream was devine! And the little bits on top, not exactly sure what they were, but they gave it a perfect yet slight crunch.All in all, I'm just kind of surprised with Crixa's. Why wouldn't you treat customers kindly? As someone that has worked as a server, I understand that food may be good but customer service is what makes people loyal - it goes hand and hand! Crixa's is delicious, but don't come here if you're expecting the full experience that includes both delicious food and amazing service. I would honestly rather spend my money at a place that would happily do both, considering this small cake was $28."

580,"Perfect amount of sweetness that's light fluff cakes (if that makes any sense) Seriously one of my favorite places to come when I have a sweet tooth! I love everything they bake here but my favorite has to be the Amaretto, Strawberry cream and the flourless chocolate. Highly recommend coming early because they do tend to run out quick of the good stuff. Pricing is definitely on the high side so if you aren't trying to break the bank on small pieces of cake, you might not want to come because the average slice is over $5."
581,"*Little slice of Hungarian paradise*Apparently this place has been here since 1998. Weird- because I've never noticed it in the neighborhood. Swear my little piggy self noticed & STOPPED by  EVERY sweet shop between my granny's house (insert image of little red riding hood.. except .. I'm clearly brown) and UC Berkeley (back when I took summer classes there Circa '2002ish)WhatevsThis place is so cool. Glad my friend's bf recommended this spot.They have class, culture, cute decorations and the most delicious sweets ever . Not to mention their espresso is pretty decent annnnd they have the most adorable Short coffee cups to go. (Toddler size)So I stopped by around 5:00 & they close at 5:30 on a Tuesday. They were extremely patient and not rushing to clean up- which is nice (hate walking into a store that closes in 1 hour and they're cleaning up).I recommend their almond cream cake which was so dang moist and light as a feather ($5ish). If you like white cake with a slight nut flavor- you'll go for this, and I do mean SLIGHT. It was so good and light I finished the cake on autopilot in 2.2 seconds. Other tasty treats : tiramisu, their seasonal strawberry cake and this awesome looking chocolate cream cakeNotes:- great shaded parking out front - chill location- apparently hecka Hungarians show up on Saturday's which is cool if you identify with that culture - patient staff  - all cakes cost around $5/$5.50"
582,"I've had this place bookmarked for a while particularly for their Amaretti cake, Tiramisu, and Boston Creme pies. HoweverI've never been able to make it here during the weekdays since they close at 5:30, so I decided to test my luck coming here on a Saturday at around 2PM (they close at 4).Much like what others have echoed, definitely come here early because the assortment you can chose from dwindles down. Luckily there were still a few slices of the Amaretti cake, but I think the other things I came to try were already sold out. They also have a few items in a separate display case by the register away from the cake display so be sure to check those items out. LOCATION: Right on Shattuck there is some street parking near this location but I think it's easier to walk from BART or bus to. They have seating inside for those who want coffee and even a few tables outside that they also bus.FOOD: $5 a slice is pricey for me, but one time for the one time right. The Amaretti cake was definitely worth the walk and I'm not a huge cake fan! The cake was moist, the cream light/airy, and overall sweet but not too sweet. The added cookies on top made for a great change in texture and sweetness to the cake. Even though I finished a slice myself, I didn't feel like I got cavities while doing so (well I hope not. haha). SERVICE: I only came here to get a cake to-go so I can't really comment on the sentiments of other Yelpers about the service. The service was friendly and greeted me right when I walked through the door, but to be honest I did feel a little rushed even though there was nobody behind me. Luckily I already knew what I wanted but I can only imagine how it would be if you had no idea. CONS: I couldn't give it 5 stars for these reasons - Hours - Limited assortment later in the day"
583,"Soft, delectable, moist cakes, the ~$5 slices of cakes here are totally worth a trip! Many Yelpers have mentioned that the ladies here aren't so friendly and that the cakes do sell out as the day goes on, so be sure to come earlier and check their website to see what delicious baked goods they're selling each day. I also found the ladies here to be pretty friendly! Anyways, the cake. I got:1) Tiramisu (5/5) - Definitely one of the best tiramisu I've enjoyed. The cake itself is so moist, and majorly soaked in coffee, contributing to the overall softness of this cake. The cream is whipped to perfect smoothness, and the flavor of this cake is absolutely delicious. Though the slice isn't that big for ~$5, I would say it's such a rich (though not heavy) dessert that the slice is a good size!2) Amaretti (5/5) - I think I love this cake more than the tiramisu. I love the vanilla flavor, smoooooth cream, soft moist fluffy cake, and the added crunch of the crushed crackers on top.  I'll definitely be back to try more things!"
584,The tiramisu with dark chocolate mousse is to.die.for.
585,"I've been coming here for years but keep forgetting to leave a review. As an undergrad I would go dessert hopping whenever I wanted to treat myself and hit up a bunch of bakeries and gorge (La Farine, Crixa, and Katrina Rozelle). Berkeley is not lacking in homey cake shops but I feel like each one has their own speciality, so it really depends on your mood.Crixa has a modest menu and a distinctive Eastern European influence (they sell pierogies and kifli!). I've tried almost all their standard cakes and their crowning glory has to be their tiramisu. The sponge cake is always perfectly moist and rich with espresso flavors, while the mascarpone is airy, light, and never too sweet. I'm partial to their Soprano version which is made with a layer of their smoky dark chocolate. I also recently tried their vanilla bizet, which is like a pavlova, all ethereal and Christmas white. The meringue base was firm yet dissolved into perfect flaky sweetness once I bit into it and the vanilla cream was exquisite and again, not too sweet. Truly a local's delight and one that I hope continue to flourish in Berkeley for years to come!"
586,"Crixa is both great and terrible. Great because of their food and coffee, terrible because of their hours and...while not terrible, the ladies behind the counter are always brusque and don't have any time for your shit. Get it together, this is a business.Crixa is totally open during the week when no one buys cake at 2 PM on a Thursday, but not on Sundays. So go on a Saturday. But do go early, because they will run out of stuff and they won't be sorry about it. They'll tell you that you should've come earlier. The bizet and ginger cake are two of our favorites, and their coffee is quite good. The coffee is pricey, but you're also shelling out $4.50 for a pastry, so go big or go home.They do have limited outdoor seating, but beware if it's sunny outside--the tables are metal and will burn your skin off. The good: delicious pastries.The bad: hours could be better."
587,"This place has the best baked goods in the Bay Area, possibly the North American continent, and maybe the world (outside of France)! Yeah, I love them! Forget tartine, or any of the other bakeries, they can't compare. I drive 2.5 hours, 2-3 times a month to get their cakes. One of my favorite things about it is that the cakes are sooo good, and the guys there are true to their Hungarian roots :) reserved and professional without any of the fake American friendliness! Win-win- I don't have to fake smile, I just get to honestly smile at them because I am glad to see them and their wonderful cakes! Btw, it would be six stars, if it were an option."
588,"Soooooo rude. Both women didn't say a single word to me. I asked for what I wanted and the lady rang up my order and just said the total while the other boxed up the dessert. The lady at the register turned the screen toward me to sign the screen. After I signed my signature she handed me my card and I said ""Thank you"".  In a low voice she said ""thank you"". If I didn't say anything she wouldn't have said anything to me. There was no greeting, or can I help you, nothing from either of the two. They seemed like they were miserable and I must have been bothering them. Why would anyone want to pay someone to treat them like that? 1st and last time ever going there. Beware if you want to be treated like a paying customer that is appreciated and supporting their business. If it doesn't matter to you then stop by for the slim pickings of variety."
589,"You know how good this place is? So good I couldn't wait to write a review. I seriously took 2 bites out of my tiramisu cake and 2 from my coconut cake and just HAD to write it right now [with my cake beside me.] I am in heaven.Coconut cake: Nice and moist with just the right amount of coconut! It does not have an overwhelming amount of coconut flavor or cream. I am definitely a fan.Tiramisu: Perfection! It's not often you come across great tiramisu so I was just blown away at the perfection of Crixa's. It is perfectly moist and the filling was on point with the right amount of expresso flavor. I am definitely a fan of this place as I'm sure you can tell. I was pretty shocked to see all my coworkers getting seconds as well! Typically for any sweets, I don't see many grabbing seconds. This time I saw them grabbing seconds and debating what to get as their third!  Where have you guys been in my life!"
590,"Amazing cakes, awful service. What a bummer because this place otherwise deserves 5 stars without a doubt.Came here to pick up my Dad's bday cake that my sister pre-ordered and paid over the phone. When I walked into the store, the employee looked at me with a very unamused look. I told her that I was here to pick up a cake, and showed her the receipt that my sister said they instructed us to do. She responded, ""Just tell me the name."" very bluntly with a rude untertone.After, I asked her for a bag and explained that I had to walk to the BART station and then take the train home. It was Friday, so I knew the trains would be busy. She told flattly told me they were $0.30, and when I asked if I could pay with card, she said no then quickly put it away. I then had to hold the cake very still on my hour and a half commute from the store. Afterwards, I told my sister my experience and she confirmed that they were a piece of work on the phone too.However, once we finally dug into the cake, I gotta admit it was AMAZING! We got the Amaretti, and wow. The cake itself was very fluffy and moist. The cream was devine! And the little bits on top, not exactly sure what they were, but they gave it a perfect yet slight crunch.All in all, I'm just kind of surprised with Crixa's. Why wouldn't you treat customers kindly? As someone that has worked as a server, I understand that food may be good but customer service is what makes people loyal - it goes hand and hand! Crixa's is delicious, but don't come here if you're expecting the full experience that includes both delicious food and amazing service. I would honestly rather spend my money at a place that would happily do both, considering this small cake was $28."
591,"After walking up to Summer Kitchen and Bake Shop but finding out their pastry chef had left so they had no cookies, cakes, etc. I headed towards the next Berkeley bakery on my list - Crixa.  Honestly, I was a bit unsure exactly what a Russian bakery would be like but turns out its pretty much like any other bakery :)  The amaretto cake was as good as the other reviewers suggest and it almost melts in your mouth.  I also tried the apple cake (with whipped cream on the side) and that was pretty good, but not as sweet as I would have liked (though the cashier warned me about that upfront).  Overall, a great experience and I was particularly surprised/delighted by how many different types of cakes, pies, and tarts they have - at least a dozen or so different flavors (though many of them were sold out by the time I got there)."
592,My favorite dessert place within walking distance! Love their flourless chocolate cake
593,"A couple of my friends have raved about this bakery and I can see why!The cakes, though a bit pricey, are worth every dollar. The cakes I have tried have all been moist and delicious. It really annoys me when frosting on cakes is too sweet, and Crixa nails the sugar ratio. My favorite cake here has to be the jamaican rum chocolate mousse cake. This cake is absolutely delicious. The rum isn't lost in the baking, as the cake is soaked, making for a really delicious cake."
594,I lived in Germany for many years and travelled through Central Europe. Crixa sort of ruined it for me because I thought I'd had the best Central European pastries around. After going to crixa I returned to Central Europe and dined in the finest coffeehouses where all the great cultural people did their culture and i felt a deep sorrow. How can crixa be the best? Berkeley continues its food domination. I hope this place doesn't get too popular because it's like the secret came out.
595,"Nice little coffee shop. Clean with a welcoming, funky decor. Very friendly and helpful staff. Fair prices.Good espresso. Loved the tres leches cake. Great place to get a slice of cake and a good cup of coffee."
596,"Best sour cherry pie I've ever had- looking forward to a return visit next week.Decor is reminiscent of a European cafe, quaint and charming."
597,"The flourless chocolate cake and poppy seed rugelah are not to be missed. The cake, in particular, was beautifully chocolatey with a lovely light texture. We also tried the ginger round, which was fine, but nothing to write home about. Loved the other two items and will be back for a slice of the pear and rose cream tarte!"

LOCATION: Right on Shattuck there is some street parking near this location but I think it's easier to walk from BART or bus to. They have seating inside for those who want coffee and even a few tables outside that they also bus.FOOD: $5 a slice is pricey for me, but one time for the one time right. The Amaretti cake was definitely worth the walk and I'm not a huge cake fan! The cake was moist, the cream light/airy, and overall sweet but not too sweet. The added cookies on top made for a great change in texture and sweetness to the cake. Even though I finished a slice myself, I didn't feel like I got cavities while doing so (well I hope not. haha). SERVICE: I only came here to get a cake to-go so I can't really comment on the sentiments of other Yelpers about the service. The service was friendly and greeted me right when I walked through the door, but to be honest I did feel a little rushed even though there was nobody behind me. Luckily I already knew what I wanted but I can only imagine how it would be if you had no idea. CONS: I couldn't give it 5 stars for these reasons - Hours - Limited assortment later in the day"
623,"Soft, delectable, moist cakes, the ~$5 slices of cakes here are totally worth a trip! Many Yelpers have mentioned that the ladies here aren't so friendly and that the cakes do sell out as the day goes on, so be sure to come earlier and check their website to see what delicious baked goods they're selling each day. I also found the ladies here to be pretty friendly! Anyways, the cake. I got:1) Tiramisu (5/5) - Definitely one of the best tiramisu I've enjoyed. The cake itself is so moist, and majorly soaked in coffee, contributing to the overall softness of this cake. The cream is whipped to perfect smoothness, and the flavor of this cake is absolutely delicious. Though the slice isn't that big for ~$5, I would say it's such a rich (though not heavy) dessert that the slice is a good size!2) Amaretti (5/5) - I think I love this cake more than the tiramisu. I love the vanilla flavor, smoooooth cream, soft moist fluffy cake, and the added crunch of the crushed crackers on top.  I'll definitely be back to try more things!"
624,The tiramisu with dark chocolate mousse is to.die.for.
625,"I've been coming here for years but keep forgetting to leave a review. As an undergrad I would go dessert hopping whenever I wanted to treat myself and hit up a bunch of bakeries and gorge (La Farine, Crixa, and Katrina Rozelle). Berkeley is not lacking in homey cake shops but I feel like each one has their own speciality, so it really depends on your mood.Crixa has a modest menu and a distinctive Eastern European influence (they sell pierogies and kifli!). I've tried almost all their standard cakes and their crowning glory has to be their tiramisu. The sponge cake is always perfectly moist and rich with espresso flavors, while the mascarpone is airy, light, and never too sweet. I'm partial to their Soprano version which is made with a layer of their smoky dark chocolate. I also recently tried their vanilla bizet, which is like a pavlova, all ethereal and Christmas white. The meringue base was firm yet dissolved into perfect flaky sweetness once I bit into it and the vanilla cream was exquisite and again, not too sweet. Truly a local's delight and one that I hope continue to flourish in Berkeley for years to come!"
626,"Crixa is both great and terrible. Great because of their food and coffee, terrible because of their hours and...while not terrible, the ladies behind the counter are always brusque and don't have any time for your shit. Get it together, this is a business.Crixa is totally open during the week when no one buys cake at 2 PM on a Thursday, but not on Sundays. So go on a Saturday. But do go early, because they will run out of stuff and they won't be sorry about it. They'll tell you that you should've come earlier. The bizet and ginger cake are two of our favorites, and their coffee is quite good. The coffee is pricey, but you're also shelling out $4.50 for a pastry, so go big or go home.They do have limited outdoor seating, but beware if it's sunny outside--the tables are metal and will burn your skin off. The good: delicious pastries.The bad: hours could be better."
627,"This place has the best baked goods in the Bay Area, possibly the North American continent, and maybe the world (outside of France)! Yeah, I love them! Forget tartine, or any of the other bakeries, they can't compare. I drive 2.5 hours, 2-3 times a month to get their cakes. One of my favorite things about it is that the cakes are sooo good, and the guys there are true to their Hungarian roots :) reserved and professional without any of the fake American friendliness! Win-win- I don't have to fake smile, I just get to honestly smile at them because I am glad to see them and their wonderful cakes! Btw, it would be six stars, if it were an option."
628,"Soooooo rude. Both women didn't say a single word to me. I asked for what I wanted and the lady rang up my order and just said the total while the other boxed up the dessert. The lady at the register turned the screen toward me to sign the screen. After I signed my signature she handed me my card and I said ""Thank you"".  In a low voice she said ""thank you"". If I didn't say anything she wouldn't have said anything to me. There was no greeting, or can I help you, nothing from either of the two. They seemed like they were miserable and I must have been bothering them. Why would anyone want to pay someone to treat them like that? 1st and last time ever going there. Beware if you want to be treated like a paying customer that is appreciated and supporting their business. If it doesn't matter to you then stop by for the slim pickings of variety."
629,"You know how good this place is? So good I couldn't wait to write a review. I seriously took 2 bites out of my tiramisu cake and 2 from my coconut cake and just HAD to write it right now [with my cake beside me.] I am in heaven.Coconut cake: Nice and moist with just the right amount of coconut! It does not have an overwhelming amount of coconut flavor or cream. I am definitely a fan.Tiramisu: Perfection! It's not often you come across great tiramisu so I was just blown away at the perfection of Crixa's. It is perfectly moist and the filling was on point with the right amount of expresso flavor. I am definitely a fan of this place as I'm sure you can tell. I was pretty shocked to see all my coworkers getting seconds as well! Typically for any sweets, I don't see many grabbing seconds. This time I saw them grabbing seconds and debating what to get as their third!  Where have you guys been in my life!"
630,"Amazing cakes, awful service. What a bummer because this place otherwise deserves 5 stars without a doubt.Came here to pick up my Dad's bday cake that my sister pre-ordered and paid over the phone. When I walked into the store, the employee looked at me with a very unamused look. I told her that I was here to pick up a cake, and showed her the receipt that my sister said they instructed us to do. She responded, ""Just tell me the name."" very bluntly with a rude untertone.After, I asked her for a bag and explained that I had to walk to the BART station and then take the train home. It was Friday, so I knew the trains would be busy. She told flattly told me they were $0.30, and when I asked if I could pay with card, she said no then quickly put it away. I then had to hold the cake very still on my hour and a half commute from the store. Afterwards, I told my sister my experience and she confirmed that they were a piece of work on the phone too.However, once we finally dug into the cake, I gotta admit it was AMAZING! We got the Amaretti, and wow. The cake itself was very fluffy and moist. The cream was devine! And the little bits on top, not exactly sure what they were, but they gave it a perfect yet slight crunch.All in all, I'm just kind of surprised with Crixa's. Why wouldn't you treat customers kindly? As someone that has worked as a server, I understand that food may be good but customer service is what makes people loyal - it goes hand and hand! Crixa's is delicious, but don't come here if you're expecting the full experience that includes both delicious food and amazing service. I would honestly rather spend my money at a place that would happily do both, considering this small cake was $28."
631,"After walking up to Summer Kitchen and Bake Shop but finding out their pastry chef had left so they had no cookies, cakes, etc. I headed towards the next Berkeley bakery on my list - Crixa.  Honestly, I was a bit unsure exactly what a Russian bakery would be like but turns out its pretty much like any other bakery :)  The amaretto cake was as good as the other reviewers suggest and it almost melts in your mouth.  I also tried the apple cake (with whipped cream on the side) and that was pretty good, but not as sweet as I would have liked (though the cashier warned me about that upfront).  Overall, a great experience and I was particularly surprised/delighted by how many different types of cakes, pies, and tarts they have - at least a dozen or so different flavors (though many of them were sold out by the time I got there)."
632,My favorite dessert place within walking distance! Love their flourless chocolate cake
633,"A couple of my friends have raved about this bakery and I can see why!The cakes, though a bit pricey, are worth every dollar. The cakes I have tried have all been moist and delicious. It really annoys me when frosting on cakes is too sweet, and Crixa nails the sugar ratio. My favorite cake here has to be the jamaican rum chocolate mousse cake. This cake is absolutely delicious. The rum isn't lost in the baking, as the cake is soaked, making for a really delicious cake."
634,I lived in Germany for many years and travelled through Central Europe. Crixa sort of ruined it for me because I thought I'd had the best Central European pastries around. After going to crixa I returned to Central Europe and dined in the finest coffeehouses where all the great cultural people did their culture and i felt a deep sorrow. How can crixa be the best? Berkeley continues its food domination. I hope this place doesn't get too popular because it's like the secret came out.
635,"Nice little coffee shop. Clean with a welcoming, funky decor. Very friendly and helpful staff. Fair prices.Good espresso. Loved the tres leches cake. Great place to get a slice of cake and a good cup of coffee."
636,"Best sour cherry pie I've ever had- looking forward to a return visit next week.Decor is reminiscent of a European cafe, quaint and charming."
637,"The flourless chocolate cake and poppy seed rugelah are not to be missed. The cake, in particular, was beautifully chocolatey with a lovely light texture. We also tried the ginger round, which was fine, but nothing to write home about. Loved the other two items and will be back for a slice of the pear and rose cream tarte!"
638,"I had heard about this place and from the Yelp reviews was really looking forward to a Boston Cream cake.  Alas, we arrived on a Saturday after 2pm and there wasn't much selection at all.  I selected a slice of the Florio cake, as the almond/raspberry combo sounded good to me but I was a little skeptical about the rose flavored creme, as I generally don't like flowery flavors (teas, etc).I must admit I was pleasantly surprised and I really enjoyed this cake.  The flavors and textures blended very nicely- creamy, crunchy, the rose flavor very subtle.  Definitely a quality cake but a bit of a splurge ($5.45/slice).  Not something I'd buy every day for that price but you get what you pay for!  Can't wait to try the Boston Creme next time, I'll have to get there in the morning!"
639,"I have enjoyed both cakes and pies from Crixa. All products I have tried were excellent. The ingredients were fresh , moist and well prepared.It has become my go to bakery. Accordingly I would recommend this bakery as one of the best in the Bay areao"
