0,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
1,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
2,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
3,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
4,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
5,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
6,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
7,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
8,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
9,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
10,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
11,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
12,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
13,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
14,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
15,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
16,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
17,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
18,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
19,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."

Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
36,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
37,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
38,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
39,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
40,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
41,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
42,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
43,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
44,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
45,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
46,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
47,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
48,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
49,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
50,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
51,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
52,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
53,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
54,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
55,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake.

The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
71,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
72,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
73,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
74,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
75,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
76,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
77,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
78,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
79,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
80,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
81,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
82,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
83,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
84,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
85,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
86,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
87,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
88,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
89,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
90,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you.

They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
105,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
106,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
107,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
108,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
109,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
110,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
111,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
112,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
113,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
114,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
115,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
116,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
117,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
118,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
119,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
120,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
121,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
122,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
123,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
124,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did.

138,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
139,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
140,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
141,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
142,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
143,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
144,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
145,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
146,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
147,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
148,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
149,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
150,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
151,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
152,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
153,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
154,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
155,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
156,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"

Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
173,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
174,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
175,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
176,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
177,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
178,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
179,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
180,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
181,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
182,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
183,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
184,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
185,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
186,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
187,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
188,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
189,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
190,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
191,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
192,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila).

207,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
208,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
209,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
210,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
211,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
212,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
213,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
214,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
215,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
216,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
217,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
218,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
219,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
220,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
221,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
222,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
223,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
224,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
225,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
226,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."

We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
241,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
242,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
243,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
244,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
245,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
246,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
247,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
248,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
249,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
250,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
251,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
252,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
253,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
254,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
255,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
256,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
257,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
258,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
259,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."

I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
276,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
277,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
278,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
279,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
280,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
281,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
282,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
283,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
284,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
285,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
286,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
287,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
288,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
289,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
290,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
291,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
292,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
293,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
294,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
295,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal.

They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
311,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
312,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
313,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
314,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
315,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
316,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
317,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
318,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
319,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
320,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
321,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
322,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
323,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
324,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
325,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
326,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
327,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
328,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
329,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
330,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special.

344,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
345,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
346,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
347,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
348,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
349,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
350,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
351,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
352,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
353,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
354,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
355,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
356,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
357,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
358,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
359,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
360,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
361,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
362,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
363,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"

377,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
378,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
379,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
380,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
381,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
382,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
383,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
384,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
385,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
386,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
387,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
388,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
389,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
390,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
391,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
392,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
393,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
394,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
395,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
396,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"

Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
413,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
414,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
415,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
416,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
417,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
418,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
419,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
420,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
421,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
422,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
423,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
424,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
425,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
426,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
427,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
428,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
429,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
430,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
431,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
432,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs.

Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
447,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
448,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
449,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
450,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
451,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
452,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
453,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
454,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
455,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
456,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
457,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
458,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
459,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
460,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
461,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
462,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
463,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
464,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
465,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
466,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma).

We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
481,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
482,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
483,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
484,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
485,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
486,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
487,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
488,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
489,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
490,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
491,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
492,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
493,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
494,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
495,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
496,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
497,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
498,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
499,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."

I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
516,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
517,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
518,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
519,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
520,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
521,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
522,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
523,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
524,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
525,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
526,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
527,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
528,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
529,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
530,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
531,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
532,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
533,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
534,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
535,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal.

They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
551,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
552,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
553,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
554,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
555,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
556,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
557,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
558,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
559,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
560,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
561,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
562,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
563,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
564,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
565,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
566,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
567,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
568,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
569,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
570,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special.

584,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
585,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
586,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
587,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
588,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
589,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
590,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
591,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
592,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
593,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
594,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
595,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
596,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
597,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
598,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
599,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
600,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
601,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
602,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
603,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"

617,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
618,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
619,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
620,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
621,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
622,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
623,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
624,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
625,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
626,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
627,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
628,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
629,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
630,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
631,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
632,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
633,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
634,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
635,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
636,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"

Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
653,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
654,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
655,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
656,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
657,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
658,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
659,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
660,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
661,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
662,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
663,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
664,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
665,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
666,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
667,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
668,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
669,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
670,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
671,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
672,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs.

Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
687,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
688,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
689,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
690,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
691,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
692,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
693,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
694,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
695,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
696,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
697,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
698,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
699,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
700,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
701,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
702,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
703,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
704,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
705,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
706,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma).

We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
721,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
722,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
723,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
724,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
725,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
726,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
727,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
728,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
729,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
730,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
731,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
732,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
733,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
734,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
735,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
736,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
737,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
738,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
739,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."

I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
756,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
757,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
758,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
759,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
760,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
761,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
762,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
763,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
764,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
765,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
766,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
767,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
768,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
769,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
770,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
771,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
772,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
773,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
774,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
775,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal.

They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
791,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
792,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
793,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
794,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
795,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
796,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
797,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
798,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
799,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
800,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
801,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
802,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
803,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
804,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
805,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
806,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
807,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
808,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
809,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
810,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special.

824,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
825,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
826,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
827,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
828,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
829,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
830,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
831,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
832,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
833,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
834,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
835,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
836,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
837,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
838,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
839,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
840,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
841,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
842,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
843,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"

857,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
858,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
859,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
860,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
861,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
862,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
863,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
864,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
865,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
866,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
867,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
868,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
869,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
870,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
871,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
872,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
873,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
874,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
875,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
876,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"

Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
893,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
894,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
895,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
896,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
897,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
898,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
899,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
900,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
901,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
902,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
903,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
904,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
905,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
906,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
907,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
908,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
909,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
910,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
911,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
912,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs.

Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
927,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
928,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
929,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
930,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
931,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
932,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
933,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
934,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
935,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
936,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
937,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
938,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
939,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
940,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
941,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
942,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
943,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
944,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
945,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
946,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma).

We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
961,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
962,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
963,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
964,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
965,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
966,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
967,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
968,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
969,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
970,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
971,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
972,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
973,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
974,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
975,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
976,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
977,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
978,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
979,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."

I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
996,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
997,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
998,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
999,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
1000,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
1001,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
1002,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
1003,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
1004,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
1005,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
1006,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
1007,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
1008,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
1009,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
1010,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
1011,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
1012,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
1013,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
1014,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
1015,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal.

But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
1031,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
1032,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
1033,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
1034,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
1035,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
1036,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
1037,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
1038,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
1039,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
1040,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
1041,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
1042,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
1043,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
1044,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
1045,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
1046,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
1047,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
1048,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
1049,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
1050,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets.

Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
1064,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
1065,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
1066,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
1067,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
1068,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
1069,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
1070,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
1071,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
1072,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
1073,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
1074,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
1075,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
1076,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
1077,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
1078,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
1079,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
1080,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
1081,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
1082,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
1083,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more.

The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
1097,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
1098,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
1099,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
1100,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
1101,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
1102,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
1103,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
1104,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
1105,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
1106,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
1107,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
1108,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
1109,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
1110,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
1111,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
1112,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
1113,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
1114,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
1115,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
1116,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs.

When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
1133,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
1134,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
1135,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
1136,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
1137,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
1138,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
1139,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
1140,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
1141,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
1142,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
1143,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
1144,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
1145,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
1146,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
1147,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
1148,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
1149,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
1150,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
1151,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."

Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
1166,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
1167,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
1168,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
1169,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
1170,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
1171,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
1172,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
1173,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
1174,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
1175,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
1176,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
1177,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
1178,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
1179,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
1180,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
1181,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
1182,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
1183,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
1184,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
1185,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet.

That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich. It was average in flavor (could taste everything in description) and the chicken a little greasier than I would have liked and the roll a little dry.Bison burger - Not a stunner, but hit the spot.Broccolini - Veggie obligation again. Fine, though a little too oily. Pretty spicy, which was fun!SERVICE: Service was slow, but perfectly friendly.AMBIANCE: Succeeding at looking hip (with a surprising amount of capacity), but missing the mark on quality. Fun to sit and watch people on first dates. Nice that there is open air seating. We were seated inside, which I found to be a touch too dark at 4pm--not yet date hour, and still so bright outside that it was sad to be in the shadows."
1200,"I came here with a party of 5 during their happy hour (after 9pm). They have the best happy hour menu! Seriously. We ordered their chicken nachos, truffle fries, and 2 orders of the fried chicken sliders. #nomZz. Their chicken nachos was so good we finished it in a heart beat. Definitely eat it as soon as it's delivered to your table as the chips do get soggy. The truffle fries is a must order here, their truffle sauce is amazing. Lastly, the fried chicken slider wasn't too bad the order came with fries. This was probably my least favorite of the three. We really were stuffed. Location is perfect as it is just a block away from Downtown Berkeley bart station. We were seated less than 5 mins on a Friday night. Great spot to watch sports as they have a number of TVs to watch from. Service was a bit slow, but overall a good experience."
1201,"Not too bad! We were seated immediately at the communal table for 4 people. If you're especially tall, and had a few drinks, be careful getting out of your seat. I witnessed someone get up and hit his head on one the light fixture and shattered one of the bulbs. Yikes! For 4 people, we order a few apps and the chicken sliders to share - tapas style. Must try: -Corndog lollipops. The fried corn bread was on point! Not too dry and nice and fluffy.  -Truffle Fries. That bowl felt like it was never ending no matter how much we ate! I didn't care for the sauce it came with, but great with ketchup."
1202,"Bar at night is LOUD so... Just know... But... Staff is on it, heavy whiskey and beer pours, big portions, and my Bone Marrow Burger was PERFECTLY medium. Like perfect... Something I have terrible getting in the Bay area... Prices are what you expect for a new place in downtown campus area."
1203,"Eureka's revamped their menu in the days that I'd been here and they've still got the usual yummy food. The selection of burgers apparently, has decreased, but the quality of the burgers is still very much delicious. I definitely cherish Eureka! for their happy hour/appetizers, where the apps are about $2 cheaper and select beers are $2 off.Recommendations:-Mac n cheese balls- as an app, comes as 5 or you can upgrade your side to 3 balls for $2 more. Honestly, I can eat like 10 of these.Made with beer cheese sauce and Fresno chilies, it's crunchy on the outside and creamy cheesy on the inside-Chicken nachos- I love the chipotle sauce on these, definitely gives an extra kick to the nachos itself. comes with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and black beans-Truffle cheese fries- yummmm! Truffle oil on anything makes it a little more fancy (but not too much), along with parmesan cheese and parsley, this app is definitely a winner-Jalapeno egg burger- fried egg, bacon, chipotle sauce with jalapenos inside, what else could you possibly ask for? This burger is super flavorful & probably not for the faint of heart :PEureka's got a wide selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and whiskeys, so it's a great place to get your grub and drank onnnn"
1204,"Ok, yes it's a trendy joint with your usual Berkeley hipster vibe. It's so cliche, I almost didn't want to eat there. But, I'm glad I did. Despite the many man buns occupying the room, the food was delicious. Seriously. My recommendations: Brussels sprouts. I'm not kidding. Best I've ever had and sweet/tangy just like your momma didn't make. Avoid the truffle fries, however. They sound like a decadent and amazing twist on an old classic but in reality, they were just fries with a tasteless and bland sauce. Not worth the money. Side note, our waitress, Tabitha, was so sweet. She strongly objected to my statement that the fries sucked, but was sweet enough to take them off the bill. She's the real MVP in my book."
1205,"This place was pretty bombbbb. My boyfriend and I came here after a long day of hiking so we had quite the appetite. To start, we ordered chicken nachos from the happy hour menu. We were expecting a small little appetizer, but it ended up being so much food. There was such a great ratio of toppings to chips. Would definitely recommend coming between 4-6pm to get these. I got the fig burger without the goat cheese and it was sooo good. It had fig marmalade, bacon, and arugula so it was the perfect balance of savory and sweet. The fries that came with it weren't very good though. My boyfriend got the jalapeño egg burger which was pretty good, it was just really greasy, so I still preferred the burger I got. He got sweet potatoes on the side which were better than my normal fries. They added cinnamon and a LOT of honey on the sweet potato fries so they were really sweet. Definitely going to come back in the future to try the tacos and Mac and cheese balls!"
1206,"I got to try the lollipop corn dog ($8), bloody mary ($5), and jalapeno egg burger ($12). The 5pc lollipop corn seemed pricey. However, the breading had a warm, soft interior and the mustard dipping sauce served as good compliment. The bloody mary had a promotional price of $5 on Saturdays. I haven't had one in a while, so I decided to order one. I realized that its taste was not for me, so I will refrain from reviewing it. Lastly, the jalapeno egg burger had a sunny side up egg that oozed yolk at the touch. The burger's flavor seemed well balanced. Nothing was too salty, the jalapeno jam imparted a touch of sweetness, and the jalapenos themselves imparted a touch of spice (nothing spicy, just the aroma). Personally, I don't like having sweet flavors in a burger, but I recognize it's usefulness in this tasting profile.I arrived at 6:30 PM on Saturday and encountered an estimated wait time of 30 min, which was reduced to 20 as some parties abandoned their places in line."
1207,"It's a burger and whiskey joint (mainly whiskey)They have good drinks and ok food. They have a variety of eats and what is considered bar food such as mac and cheese tots, truffled fries, salad etc. They have a couple of burgers that can be catered to a variety of people such as the turkey burger as an alternative meat. The salad was my favorite dish of the night. a kale salad... shows much good this place might be considered a burger place.I came here on a friday night with a friend to hang out. I ordered a fresno burger with fig marmalade and medium rare and with a side of broccoli rahbi as a substitute. my burger came out about medium with a good amount of rahbi which had a hint of citrus and red pepper flakes. What I didn't like was that the rahbi was over cooked and really soft Wherefore I felt it should have been crunchy to the bite and the burger wasn't anything spectacular. Service was decent. After my food came, we were left alone for a long while but the bill placed in front of us right after we got our appetizers."
1208,"Eureka, I gave you so many chances and you let me down every time. After the horrible experiences I've had (and today being the last straw), I can't see myself recommending this place. Food comes out extremely slowly, orders are incorrect, and the servers are unapologetic. I called in for a takeout order, they said 15 min. 25 min later, my food is given to me incorrectly and cold. They just don't care that customers are waiting - nobody cared to acknowledge me until I demanded someone's attention. Sadly this isn't the first time this has happened so it's clear there are management and quality issues."
1209,"This review is for the watermelon salad and customer service. The customer service was great, and food took 15 minutes to serve even though we were the first ones there. Although I think they waited to serve both of our dishes together. The salad size was generous and the ingredients were well mixed up. I asked for no glaze and dressing on the side. I was pretty full after eating my salad. Not everyone was friendly, but our waitress was thankfully."
1210,"A place like Eureka seems a little out of place in Berkeley. A little too...normal. Nice upscale-ish bar/restaurant with sliding windows that own onto the street (although no actual patio), with no special twist on the menu or anything. For vegetarians, there aren't a ton of options here. I've had both the falafel tacos and beet burger and I think that might be all your choices (minus salad of course). The beet burger was interesting. I've had many a veggie burger on my life but never with beets. But I think the recipe could use a little work as it was petty crumbly, as veggie burgers are wont to be. The falafel tacos come in lettuce cups and the falafel was ok but nothing special. They remind me of the falafel disks at Subway.Their happy hour hours are are quite extensive. There are appetizers and drinks on special. Tried the brussel sprouts and they were very good. The house fries are also super good. They come with house made ketchup that is so delicious. I've never left any in the little tin they give you. The sweet potato fries are done in a way I don't love: topped with honey and cinnamon. It's just too sweet for me, but you can all for them without and they are great. Overall, it's not a place I would come back to frequently. Just somewhere nice to take friends and visitors."
1211,"One night I was starving to death after hanging out at Barnes & Noble in Emeryville. A friend that I was with asked what I wanted to eat. Mind you it was 11pm.  B&N had just closed. I told him I was too hungry to look for a place & that he can have the honors of searching for a delicious restaurant so we can fill our tummies. He found this place and I couldn't have been anymore proud that he actually found a restaurant that was open late, served awesome burgers (Bison burger recommended!!! Do not waste your money on the truffle fries ""-1 star"") & had TVs. Definitely a cool & clean place to watch sports, but their TVs are a tad bit on the small side. They also have a bar which is cool for those who enjoy getting sloshed. If you're sloshed, you won't even notice the size of the TVs."
1212,"EUREKA in Berkeley! This little chain happening is great. I've been to the Palm Desert one and the Village one in Woodland Hills and they're all fab. Came to town with family and went to Eureka on a Thursday night. Called ahead of time to see the wait time or make a reservation (they dont take reservations) but no one picked up. When we arrived it was very packed. We had a wait time of 20-25 minutes and we were willing to wait. We were seated in a booth by the bar. The menu is extensive. From appetizers, to entrees, tacos, finger foods, salads, and comfort foods. They also have a full bar - YES PLEASE! We ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes on the side. The salmon was cooked pretty well, maybe lacked some flavor. The mash was good. Came with an arugula salad. Also, we got the broccolini. Could've needed some more flavor and there was only 3 pieces of broccolini. The chicken tacos are a must. Almost all the locations have these tacos and it's impressive. So flavorful and has a bit of a kick. The mahi mahi tacos are AMAZING. There's mango salsa on top and the spice is so good. Kinda makes you sniffle but it's worth it. We also got the corn dogs. Those were super fun to eat. The sausage wasn't a regular hot dog, it had a lot of flavor and the batter was delicious. For drinks we ordered a Chardonnay wine and The Industry (with tequila). Overall it was great. Love the place and the TACOS of course. See you soon y'all!"
1213,"I've been here quite often over the past few years, since it's a solid place to take friends out to for a nice meal or drink. Ambiance is very lively and friendly, with plenty of seating and a bar in the back. Burgers here are top notch and delicious! I've had my fair share of them and you can't go wrong :) my personal favorite is the jalapeño egg, because I love a good runny egg on any sandwich! Happy hour goes till 6pm and starts back up in the evening at 9pm? (I think...) and there are some great deals there! $2 off wine and beer, but unfortunately limited to a portion of their menu. Sad that this HH doesn't include their cocktails. Their Moscow Mule is a usual for me, but be warned their drinks are a bit stronger than other bars. Their Moscow Mule is very gingery, so avoid it if you don't like that spice! Otherwise, a great place to catch up with friends over beer and burgers! Plus they have TVs for those into sports~ knocked 1 star down for the potential long wait on occasion and the slightly pricey menu items. Definitely recommend though!"
1214,"From the pictures I thought this would have been more of an appetizer/finger food/grub location. When we arrived, we soon realized that it was actually a very nice sit down Resturant with a full bar. In time for happy hour, we ordered chicken nachos and they definitely blew me away. Just as big as nachos you'd get at a giants game, but half the price and 2x as delicious. I ordered sweet potato fries along with my jalepeno burger, and there's nothing I'd change EXCEPT for the amount of honey and cinnamon they put on the sweet potato fries. It was so much cinnamon that t almost burned. Maybe only cuz my tongue was being blasted by the plethora of flavors going on haha"
1215,I've been to Eureka! many times and I've always been satisfied with my meal. I'm not big on beef but every once in a while I'll get a craving and Eureka always hits the spot. I'll review my last visit which was also for my roommate's birthday. I went early to put our name down since I know they don't to reservations and ran into a friend that was early as well. I put my name down for 10 and we went to walk around before going back at the desired time. Once we were seated everyone else arrived and we brought balloons and even a cake without a box (it was homemade!). They were gracious enough to let us store the cake in their fridge and brought it out after our meal. I usually get the Blues Burger since I love blue cheese and this time they even let me swap out the beef patty for a turkey patty! Perfect! Their fries are always good as well and a few people ordered drinks and whatnot. When we were done they brought the cake out and we all sang and then cut the cake. Eureka is also great for a late night bite after the 10pm showings at the movie theatre (which I've done many times) and just a great place in general for drinks and a decent burger!
1216,"h0Ly mother of pearl, BONE MARROW BURGER?! I think I just died and went to hamburger heaven. To some, the portions here are an adequate size. But for my heffer ass, I wish the portions were bigger.  My friends and I were famished after being serenaded all night by the smooth vocalizations from the talented Gallant and John Legend at the Greek Theater on May 27th. What better way to cap our late night than by stuffing our faces with juicy, mouthwatering and delicious burgers at Eureka! Let's be real for a moment plz: If your BAE doesn't base their order based on your desires, is that person really BAE? In my case, my boyfriend proved he was definitely bae that night when he saw how torn I was between the Bone Marrow Burger and the Fresno Fig Burger, so he insisted we order both to fulfill my little fat girl desires. (Even though I'm pretty sure he had his heart set on the Jalapeno Egg Burger. Oh well! Boyfriend duties, yehknow?!) Now onto the real order of business: the burgers! My bone marrow burger with a side of broccolini (+$2) was placed in front of me and I didn't hesitate to dive in. My burger was cooked to a medium rare juicy perfection, and the layer of bone marrow porcini butter was so savory, flavorful and rich. I decided to eat mine open face which I believe made a world's difference so I could really taste the flavors of the patty and bone marrow without the bread overpowering the whole dish. I forced myself to stay away from the standard order of fries that come with the burger and instead opted for the broccolini- which had a nice splash of lemon and sprinkle of chili flakes. The Fresno Fig Burger was crackin' as well! The burger's flavor was really enhanced when accompanied with the sweet aftertaste of the figs. The savory and sweet combo was well played, especially with the goat cheese. We asked for our fries well done (because we're hella extra) but unfortunately the crisp level did not meet our expectations. Boyf licked his plate clean and claims he was still a little hungry after (and no I did not hog his burger.) With that being said, Eureka! has definitely made it on my top 3 gourmet burger list. Well done!"
1217,"Eureka is my go to place for a meal before or after seeing a show at Berkeley Rep.  I really like their watermelon salad and the brussel sprouts - finally, brussel sprouts that taste good without the use of bacon.  Osso bucco riblets were just ok - the aioli tastes like buffalo wing sauce.Mac N cheese balls goodTablemates liked burger and falafel taco.Front window/doors are retractable so on a nice day it's an open air restaurant.Allston Parking Garage right next door."
1218,"So I was running a quick errand and had a little time left for lunch.Decided to stop by this joint after a friend had recommended it to me.GREAT joint!  Love the interior, whoever was behind this interior deserves kudos.  The wood panels invoke warmth while the concrete gives it an edgy feeling.  Restaurants have sure come a long way.I looked over the menu and decided to sample three items:-Caesar Salad-Burger-Corndog LollipopsThe plating here is pretty as well as the food.  Caesar salad came out artfully plated as well as my burger, done perfectly medium rare.  The best part of my order were the corndog lollipops.  Fried to ensure that everything was done right, exterior layer with that imfamous crunch, and a novel approach to tweaking an American favorite.Good service, nice interior, and tasty entrees/appetizers.I'm definitely coming back!"
1219,"College date spot with mediocre food, especially relative to other options nearby. No truly healthy options. Advantage is in ambiance only. FOOD: Everything we ordered we found disappointing. My expectations were high given the Yelp rating and the ambiance (sit-down), but the food was sub-fast-cas in my opinion.Shrimp ceviche - The shrimp was quite tough, which I haven't experienced before. Made me feel a little nervous. The spices were lacking, and it tasted more like sea-viche than ceviche. Perhaps the shrimp was cooked and left in the fridge too long?Kale salad - Getting in veggies! Fine. That said, I've had better salads from Trader Joe's.Napa chicken sandwich - Trying to stay on the healthier side the day we visited, and did not feel this criteria was satisfied with the chicken sandwich.
