0,"Came here last night after some recommendations from my family and loved it!As soon as we walked in the door, a waiter approached us and sat us down immediately. It was pretty crowded too, so this was great customer service. The service throughout our entire time there was great and I have no complaints!The food was amazing. I was born in El Salvador, so I know Salvadoran food when I taste it. Let me say this is true Salvadoran food. I ordered the pupusas with cheese and beans, and they were perfect! Abundance in size, not greasy, and a perfect blend of cheese and beans. I also ordered the horchata and it was good, a little too sweet for my liking but true Salvadoran horchata (tastes a little different than Mexican horchata for those of you unfamiliar.) My fiancée ordered the platillo típico which comes with two pupusas of your choice and rice and beans and he loved it too. My parents ordered a combination of the chicken sandwich, corn tamales, and yucca. I tried a little bit of everything and it satisfied all my cravings!If you are in the area, please do yourself a favor and come to this place. They have such a large variety of dishes to choose from and they depict Salvadoran cuisine to perfection!"
1,"Salvadoran restaurant. ...simple decore. Would rate food 4 stars, service 4 stars.....but bathroom so filthy had to drop overall rating.Dinner :  Pupusas 1 veggie 1 pork & cheese Delious!!! added there homemade slaw...Delicious treat. 5 star.Corn tamales. ..1 steamed , 1fried...Fried Tilapia platter with rice & platanos...yummy food."
2,"I love their pupusas and mangonada!I think they are very reasonably priced, $9.99 lunch menu.They are very accomodating for call-in orders.  I like to call my order in as I drive to the restaurant because I anm limited on lunch time and I like to get in before hteir lunch rush.I love their chicken and cheese pupusa, atol de elote beverage, and mangonada.Their entire menu looks delicious, but every time I visit I order the same thing, haha.I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is seeking delicious food!"
3,"Found Platano thanks to good ol' Yelp, and thank goodness I did because it was absolutely delicious.Came in with some friends for dinner and was immediately sat down. When looking over the menu, I realized that their lunch and dinner options were different instead of being the same and having dinner cost a bit more. This definitely surprised me because I feel like I don't see it often at casual restaurants such as Platano! The only thing that really seemed to be calling my name was #2 on the lunch menu which was two pupusas of your choice with a side avocado salad. I asked if I could order this for my dinner, and they said it was no problem but I would be charged more. I happily obliged :)I decided on the Revuelta (fried pork) and Queso y Loroco (Salvadoran flower). Both pupusas were phenomenal, perfect little pockets of heaven. It was only my second time having the food, but I feel confident in saying that these are some of the best I'll ever have in my life time. The salad was a great addition and balance of greens too, so I'm super thankful they allowed me to get this lunch item during dinner.All in all, delicious and good choice for a meal if you're in berkeley :)"
4,"I wasn't a fan the first time I went here. But after my last visit, I can safely say this is a great place for lunch or dinner if you ever find yourself on University Ave. From the outside, it doesn't seem to be that big of a restaurant. But walking in, there are a good amount of tables, with the restaurant extending to the back -- perfect for groups. The atmosphere is a little dingy, but lively nonetheless with paintings and decor to match the Latin American theme. For lunch, there are multiple options of combos that one can choose from pupusas, plantains, tamales,  side salad, and  sour cream and beans. The combinations are endless, and will satisfy those who want to try a bit of everything. My plate came with two pupusas, chicken tamales, and pickled vegetables. I got the revuelta pupusas which was filled with crispy tender pork, and cheese and also the beef and cheese. Essentially, they were a fried stuffed corn masa tortilla with meat and cheese inside. Alone, they were a bit bland with not a lot of seasoning but with a splash of hot sauce and some pickled vegetables the pupusas tasted much better. The chicken tamales was nothing special, but again with the some hot sauce and pickled vegetables it was really good. My friend got a side of sour cream and beans which i regret not getting, since dipping the pupusas in the sides made it even better!Overall, the prices are reasonable for the quality of food and portions are more than generous. My only complaint would be the service as it took over 30 mins to receive our food when it wasn't even that busy. If you never had El Salvadorian food, its a must try!"
5,"This was my second time coming to Platano, and it definitely didn't disappoint. The first time, I came for dinner, but this time it was for lunch. The vibe was a little different. There were more people during lunchtime, and the whole place felt livelier and brighter. Both my friend and I loved what we got the first time we came here, so we skipped over the lunch specials in favor of their full menu so that we could re-experience the deliciousness we remembered. I ordered the Albondigas, essentially meatballs in some kind of tomato sauce. The dish comes with two sides, so I ordered casamientos (a fried mixture of rice and black beans) and platanos (can't come to Platano without ordering platanos!). I noticed that on their dinner menu, platanos is not a side that is offered, which is a shame because they added a really nice balance to the meal as a whole. The meatballs were delicious - a good texture and perfectly seasoned. As for the sides, I definitely recommend casamientos and platanos. The casamientos are a more interesting version of rice, essentially, and the platanos added a bit of sweetness to the dish, which was perfect for me since I have a massive sweet tooth.My friend and I also ordered a papusa to share, which is essentially a stuffed corn masa tortilla. We chose the chicharron (fried pork) papusa, since it seemed to be The Thing to order here. I don't know if I would order the papusa again, but I'm glad I tried it. The breading was too thick for me and the filling wasn't that exciting. Service was okay, but we had to work a little bit to get their attention for the bill.Still, I'll definitely be coming back here next time!"
6,"VEGAN GLUTEN FREE REVIEW:I love Platano, or rather, their black bean pupusas, curtido, and salsa. The flavors are amazing and they're vegan and gluten free! Platano is my to-go-to place for comforting and delicious food; however, on my last visit there, I saw that they had risen the price for their pupusas. It was $2.50 for a pupusa but now, it's $2.90. For a black bean only pupusa, that's a little steep. I've been to places in San Jose that charge $1.50 per pupusa of the same size, so I feel kind of salty about the price increase. I'll continue to frequent Platano, but I hope they don't raise their prices again; otherwise, it's time to find another pupusaría."
7,"Dependable, nourishing Salvadorian fare served in a cozy, homey space in downtown Berkeley. The homey feel extends to the cooking here, which feels quite authentic. The carne desilada, for example, was a melange of pan-fried crispy shredded beef, eggs, tomato, onions, and bell peppers. Meanwhile, a glass of horchata was refreshing - not too sweet, but not bland - although it was full of ice. Service is courteous here, although as other reviewers have noted, it can take a while for things to come out. Nevertheless, if you want Latin American fare that's not expensive given what you get, not to mention dishes that won't feel like they're busting your gut, Platano is a solid choice."
8,"And we are back again at this selicious place. For those that may want some guidance on other than Pupusas, try the Salpicon with casamiento and sour cream..."
9,"This. Place. Is. Bomb. It's rare that a whole table will agree on one opinion about a restaurant, but no one had any complaints and everyone absolutely loved their food (see reference photo #1.  Total inhalation) Prices are super reasonable (especially for the quality of food you're getting) and portions are quite generous. I ordered the potato stew with re fried beans and a salad and everything was perfect. The stew wasn't as thick as traditional American stews but it packed a punch- seasoned well, full of flavor, super tender and still incredibly filling even without the hearty consistency I'm used to. Beans were awesome (I'm a sucker for re fried beans) and the salad added a nice fresh crunch to my whole meal (the citrusy dressing was a refreshing plus). Everyone at my table ate in silence because we couldn't be bothered with conversation when we were having a tastebud fiesta in our mouths."
10,"VEGAN REVIEW!So apparently, the black bean pupusas are vegan! I have been eating here for years (former Cal student) and I did not know this. I also order the Avocado Salad (no chips, no cheese, dressing on the side) which is also vegan. I imagine the fried plantains are also vegan. Overall, delicious food!"
11,"Pupusaaaaaaas!!!! Everytime I come here the pupusas are a must. I would recommend coming during lunch hours (11-2:30, I think) because they have $10 lunch plate specials which are some combination of 1-2 pupusas, fried plantains, and salad/beans/sour cream. I've tried the chicken, cheese, and zucchini/onion/cheese pupusas and really liked them all. The chicken is probably my favorite of the three. I've also tried the avocado salad and its incredibly filling and tasty."
12,"My favourite papusa and plantanos restaurant in the East Bay. Service, ambiance, quality of food and price met my expectation."
13,"Absolutely delicious and authentic pupusas here! My husband's family is Salvadorean so I know good pupusas when I see them. We got there a little later than our reservation and they were still very accommodating and served us fast. Ordered the Plato Tipico with One Revuelta and One Queso pupusa. They did not disappoint! We also tried their Pastelitos as an appetizer and they were so big, and delicious as well. Highly recommend this Salvadorean restaurant!"
14,"YUMMM! I've never had Salvadorian food until trying this place and now there's no going back for me. Location: It's right at the heart of University St so street parking can be a pain. There's a parking lot behind El Burro but it does get packed. If you're lucky though, you can find some street parking in the areas around university. Service: It looks small on the outside but inside it's quite large. I usually get seated really quickly regardless of how big of a group I come with. However, it can take some time for them to bring you water/refill it and for your order to get to your table once you order. Price: Some dishes can be pretty pricey but the reason to come here is for the pupusas! I think that when I first started coming here they were $2.5 and might have raised to $2.75. Food: My go tos are the ruvuelta and bean and cheese. I usually order only 2 since they're so filling! I always pair them with plantains too. YUMMM. With your meal they bring you some sauce and slaw. I believe there are two levels of the sauce, they usually bring you the milder one but if you ask they have a spicier version. I tend to finish a whole bottle when I go with friends. lol. Overall, a Berkeley gem that not only provides delicious food, but at a decent price."
15,"Got pupusas (the cheese and squash blossom and the cheese and beans) with fried plantains. It was really good! Will definitely be coming back again, and recommend it to anyone interested in an affordable, filling, and delicious meal!"
16,"Located near many different restaurants near the ""college b-town"" area . Small waiting area in front waiting to be seated but quick turn around service (larger tables in rear). I order the shrimp and steak  x convo with rice and the plate was big enough to share. I ordered the sangria which they ran out fruit for but got a double portion for it and it was still very good"
17,First time eating here and eating El Savadorian food. Food was real fresh and so good. Pupusas were so delicious. The bean and sour cream were so creamy.  Loved the plantains.Great service!! Will be going back soon!!
18,"The menu at Platano has plenty of options from light soups to dense plates. Food: I ordered the Ensalada de Aguacate (avocado), which was healthily portioned, vibrant, and aesthetically pleasing. The grilled chicken had a few fried pieces that were too charred for my liking, in other words burnt. I enjoyed the vinaigrette as it countered the creamy avocado, creating a nice balance. The two-piece pupusa combo plate was filling; one pupusa was filled with cheese and the other with pork and beans, the plate came with a few sides. The pupusas were warm on the interior and lightly fried on the outside, however the flavor was lacking and the cheese didn't quite melt enough. They had a microwave textural feel to them and were lacking freshness. We smothered them with crema, but I recommend topping it off with the coleslaw mix to allow the acidity to cut through the richness of the crema. Service: Friendly, but a bit slow. Our food took a while, fortunately we weren't starving.Ambiance: Large and casual restaurant with plenty of seating to accommodate large parties. Price: Most plates ranged from $-$, seafood dishes on the pricier end. Overall: The food was fair in taste and quality could've been better; nice service with a casual ambiance."
19,"I'm from El Salvador and I make the trip from SF to Berkeley to eat here. The food is on point. The decor is nice and the service is efficient. Their ensalada drink could use more fruit in it. Try salpicón, a chilled dish that you don't find everywhere. Pupusas de queso con loroco are yummy!"

I noticed that on their dinner menu, platanos is not a side that is offered, which is a shame because they added a really nice balance to the meal as a whole. The meatballs were delicious - a good texture and perfectly seasoned. As for the sides, I definitely recommend casamientos and platanos. The casamientos are a more interesting version of rice, essentially, and the platanos added a bit of sweetness to the dish, which was perfect for me since I have a massive sweet tooth.My friend and I also ordered a papusa to share, which is essentially a stuffed corn masa tortilla. We chose the chicharron (fried pork) papusa, since it seemed to be The Thing to order here. I don't know if I would order the papusa again, but I'm glad I tried it. The breading was too thick for me and the filling wasn't that exciting. Service was okay, but we had to work a little bit to get their attention for the bill.Still, I'll definitely be coming back here next time!"
46,"VEGAN GLUTEN FREE REVIEW:I love Platano, or rather, their black bean pupusas, curtido, and salsa. The flavors are amazing and they're vegan and gluten free! Platano is my to-go-to place for comforting and delicious food; however, on my last visit there, I saw that they had risen the price for their pupusas. It was $2.50 for a pupusa but now, it's $2.90. For a black bean only pupusa, that's a little steep. I've been to places in San Jose that charge $1.50 per pupusa of the same size, so I feel kind of salty about the price increase. I'll continue to frequent Platano, but I hope they don't raise their prices again; otherwise, it's time to find another pupusaría."
47,"Dependable, nourishing Salvadorian fare served in a cozy, homey space in downtown Berkeley. The homey feel extends to the cooking here, which feels quite authentic. The carne desilada, for example, was a melange of pan-fried crispy shredded beef, eggs, tomato, onions, and bell peppers. Meanwhile, a glass of horchata was refreshing - not too sweet, but not bland - although it was full of ice. Service is courteous here, although as other reviewers have noted, it can take a while for things to come out. Nevertheless, if you want Latin American fare that's not expensive given what you get, not to mention dishes that won't feel like they're busting your gut, Platano is a solid choice."
48,"And we are back again at this selicious place. For those that may want some guidance on other than Pupusas, try the Salpicon with casamiento and sour cream..."
49,"This. Place. Is. Bomb. It's rare that a whole table will agree on one opinion about a restaurant, but no one had any complaints and everyone absolutely loved their food (see reference photo #1.  Total inhalation) Prices are super reasonable (especially for the quality of food you're getting) and portions are quite generous. I ordered the potato stew with re fried beans and a salad and everything was perfect. The stew wasn't as thick as traditional American stews but it packed a punch- seasoned well, full of flavor, super tender and still incredibly filling even without the hearty consistency I'm used to. Beans were awesome (I'm a sucker for re fried beans) and the salad added a nice fresh crunch to my whole meal (the citrusy dressing was a refreshing plus). Everyone at my table ate in silence because we couldn't be bothered with conversation when we were having a tastebud fiesta in our mouths."
50,"VEGAN REVIEW!So apparently, the black bean pupusas are vegan! I have been eating here for years (former Cal student) and I did not know this. I also order the Avocado Salad (no chips, no cheese, dressing on the side) which is also vegan. I imagine the fried plantains are also vegan. Overall, delicious food!"
51,"Pupusaaaaaaas!!!! Everytime I come here the pupusas are a must. I would recommend coming during lunch hours (11-2:30, I think) because they have $10 lunch plate specials which are some combination of 1-2 pupusas, fried plantains, and salad/beans/sour cream. I've tried the chicken, cheese, and zucchini/onion/cheese pupusas and really liked them all. The chicken is probably my favorite of the three. I've also tried the avocado salad and its incredibly filling and tasty."
52,"My favourite papusa and plantanos restaurant in the East Bay. Service, ambiance, quality of food and price met my expectation."
53,"Absolutely delicious and authentic pupusas here! My husband's family is Salvadorean so I know good pupusas when I see them. We got there a little later than our reservation and they were still very accommodating and served us fast. Ordered the Plato Tipico with One Revuelta and One Queso pupusa. They did not disappoint! We also tried their Pastelitos as an appetizer and they were so big, and delicious as well. Highly recommend this Salvadorean restaurant!"
54,"YUMMM! I've never had Salvadorian food until trying this place and now there's no going back for me. Location: It's right at the heart of University St so street parking can be a pain. There's a parking lot behind El Burro but it does get packed. If you're lucky though, you can find some street parking in the areas around university. Service: It looks small on the outside but inside it's quite large. I usually get seated really quickly regardless of how big of a group I come with. However, it can take some time for them to bring you water/refill it and for your order to get to your table once you order. Price: Some dishes can be pretty pricey but the reason to come here is for the pupusas! I think that when I first started coming here they were $2.5 and might have raised to $2.75. Food: My go tos are the ruvuelta and bean and cheese. I usually order only 2 since they're so filling! I always pair them with plantains too. YUMMM. With your meal they bring you some sauce and slaw. I believe there are two levels of the sauce, they usually bring you the milder one but if you ask they have a spicier version. I tend to finish a whole bottle when I go with friends. lol. Overall, a Berkeley gem that not only provides delicious food, but at a decent price."
55,"Got pupusas (the cheese and squash blossom and the cheese and beans) with fried plantains. It was really good! Will definitely be coming back again, and recommend it to anyone interested in an affordable, filling, and delicious meal!"
56,"Located near many different restaurants near the ""college b-town"" area . Small waiting area in front waiting to be seated but quick turn around service (larger tables in rear). I order the shrimp and steak  x convo with rice and the plate was big enough to share. I ordered the sangria which they ran out fruit for but got a double portion for it and it was still very good"
57,First time eating here and eating El Savadorian food. Food was real fresh and so good. Pupusas were so delicious. The bean and sour cream were so creamy.  Loved the plantains.Great service!! Will be going back soon!!
58,"The menu at Platano has plenty of options from light soups to dense plates. Food: I ordered the Ensalada de Aguacate (avocado), which was healthily portioned, vibrant, and aesthetically pleasing. The grilled chicken had a few fried pieces that were too charred for my liking, in other words burnt. I enjoyed the vinaigrette as it countered the creamy avocado, creating a nice balance. The two-piece pupusa combo plate was filling; one pupusa was filled with cheese and the other with pork and beans, the plate came with a few sides. The pupusas were warm on the interior and lightly fried on the outside, however the flavor was lacking and the cheese didn't quite melt enough. They had a microwave textural feel to them and were lacking freshness. We smothered them with crema, but I recommend topping it off with the coleslaw mix to allow the acidity to cut through the richness of the crema. Service: Friendly, but a bit slow. Our food took a while, fortunately we weren't starving.Ambiance: Large and casual restaurant with plenty of seating to accommodate large parties. Price: Most plates ranged from $-$, seafood dishes on the pricier end. Overall: The food was fair in taste and quality could've been better; nice service with a casual ambiance."
59,"I'm from El Salvador and I make the trip from SF to Berkeley to eat here. The food is on point. The decor is nice and the service is efficient. Their ensalada drink could use more fruit in it. Try salpicón, a chilled dish that you don't find everywhere. Pupusas de queso con loroco are yummy!"
60,"Came here last night after some recommendations from my family and loved it!As soon as we walked in the door, a waiter approached us and sat us down immediately. It was pretty crowded too, so this was great customer service. The service throughout our entire time there was great and I have no complaints!The food was amazing. I was born in El Salvador, so I know Salvadoran food when I taste it. Let me say this is true Salvadoran food. I ordered the pupusas with cheese and beans, and they were perfect! Abundance in size, not greasy, and a perfect blend of cheese and beans. I also ordered the horchata and it was good, a little too sweet for my liking but true Salvadoran horchata (tastes a little different than Mexican horchata for those of you unfamiliar.) My fiancée ordered the platillo típico which comes with two pupusas of your choice and rice and beans and he loved it too. My parents ordered a combination of the chicken sandwich, corn tamales, and yucca. I tried a little bit of everything and it satisfied all my cravings!If you are in the area, please do yourself a favor and come to this place. They have such a large variety of dishes to choose from and they depict Salvadoran cuisine to perfection!"
61,"Salvadoran restaurant. ...simple decore. Would rate food 4 stars, service 4 stars.....but bathroom so filthy had to drop overall rating.Dinner :  Pupusas 1 veggie 1 pork & cheese Delious!!! added there homemade slaw...Delicious treat. 5 star.Corn tamales. ..1 steamed , 1fried...Fried Tilapia platter with rice & platanos...yummy food."
62,"I love their pupusas and mangonada!I think they are very reasonably priced, $9.99 lunch menu.They are very accomodating for call-in orders.  I like to call my order in as I drive to the restaurant because I anm limited on lunch time and I like to get in before hteir lunch rush.I love their chicken and cheese pupusa, atol de elote beverage, and mangonada.Their entire menu looks delicious, but every time I visit I order the same thing, haha.I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is seeking delicious food!"
63,"Found Platano thanks to good ol' Yelp, and thank goodness I did because it was absolutely delicious.Came in with some friends for dinner and was immediately sat down. When looking over the menu, I realized that their lunch and dinner options were different instead of being the same and having dinner cost a bit more. This definitely surprised me because I feel like I don't see it often at casual restaurants such as Platano! The only thing that really seemed to be calling my name was #2 on the lunch menu which was two pupusas of your choice with a side avocado salad. I asked if I could order this for my dinner, and they said it was no problem but I would be charged more. I happily obliged :)I decided on the Revuelta (fried pork) and Queso y Loroco (Salvadoran flower). Both pupusas were phenomenal, perfect little pockets of heaven. It was only my second time having the food, but I feel confident in saying that these are some of the best I'll ever have in my life time. The salad was a great addition and balance of greens too, so I'm super thankful they allowed me to get this lunch item during dinner.All in all, delicious and good choice for a meal if you're in berkeley :)"
64,"I wasn't a fan the first time I went here. But after my last visit, I can safely say this is a great place for lunch or dinner if you ever find yourself on University Ave. From the outside, it doesn't seem to be that big of a restaurant. But walking in, there are a good amount of tables, with the restaurant extending to the back -- perfect for groups. The atmosphere is a little dingy, but lively nonetheless with paintings and decor to match the Latin American theme. For lunch, there are multiple options of combos that one can choose from pupusas, plantains, tamales,  side salad, and  sour cream and beans. The combinations are endless, and will satisfy those who want to try a bit of everything. My plate came with two pupusas, chicken tamales, and pickled vegetables. I got the revuelta pupusas which was filled with crispy tender pork, and cheese and also the beef and cheese. Essentially, they were a fried stuffed corn masa tortilla with meat and cheese inside. Alone, they were a bit bland with not a lot of seasoning but with a splash of hot sauce and some pickled vegetables the pupusas tasted much better. The chicken tamales was nothing special, but again with the some hot sauce and pickled vegetables it was really good. My friend got a side of sour cream and beans which i regret not getting, since dipping the pupusas in the sides made it even better!Overall, the prices are reasonable for the quality of food and portions are more than generous. My only complaint would be the service as it took over 30 mins to receive our food when it wasn't even that busy. If you never had El Salvadorian food, its a must try!"
65,"This was my second time coming to Platano, and it definitely didn't disappoint. The first time, I came for dinner, but this time it was for lunch. The vibe was a little different. There were more people during lunchtime, and the whole place felt livelier and brighter. Both my friend and I loved what we got the first time we came here, so we skipped over the lunch specials in favor of their full menu so that we could re-experience the deliciousness we remembered. I ordered the Albondigas, essentially meatballs in some kind of tomato sauce.

Service: It looks small on the outside but inside it's quite large. I usually get seated really quickly regardless of how big of a group I come with. However, it can take some time for them to bring you water/refill it and for your order to get to your table once you order. Price: Some dishes can be pretty pricey but the reason to come here is for the pupusas! I think that when I first started coming here they were $2.5 and might have raised to $2.75. Food: My go tos are the ruvuelta and bean and cheese. I usually order only 2 since they're so filling! I always pair them with plantains too. YUMMM. With your meal they bring you some sauce and slaw. I believe there are two levels of the sauce, they usually bring you the milder one but if you ask they have a spicier version. I tend to finish a whole bottle when I go with friends. lol. Overall, a Berkeley gem that not only provides delicious food, but at a decent price."
95,"Got pupusas (the cheese and squash blossom and the cheese and beans) with fried plantains. It was really good! Will definitely be coming back again, and recommend it to anyone interested in an affordable, filling, and delicious meal!"
96,"Located near many different restaurants near the ""college b-town"" area . Small waiting area in front waiting to be seated but quick turn around service (larger tables in rear). I order the shrimp and steak  x convo with rice and the plate was big enough to share. I ordered the sangria which they ran out fruit for but got a double portion for it and it was still very good"
97,First time eating here and eating El Savadorian food. Food was real fresh and so good. Pupusas were so delicious. The bean and sour cream were so creamy.  Loved the plantains.Great service!! Will be going back soon!!
98,"The menu at Platano has plenty of options from light soups to dense plates. Food: I ordered the Ensalada de Aguacate (avocado), which was healthily portioned, vibrant, and aesthetically pleasing. The grilled chicken had a few fried pieces that were too charred for my liking, in other words burnt. I enjoyed the vinaigrette as it countered the creamy avocado, creating a nice balance. The two-piece pupusa combo plate was filling; one pupusa was filled with cheese and the other with pork and beans, the plate came with a few sides. The pupusas were warm on the interior and lightly fried on the outside, however the flavor was lacking and the cheese didn't quite melt enough. They had a microwave textural feel to them and were lacking freshness. We smothered them with crema, but I recommend topping it off with the coleslaw mix to allow the acidity to cut through the richness of the crema. Service: Friendly, but a bit slow. Our food took a while, fortunately we weren't starving.Ambiance: Large and casual restaurant with plenty of seating to accommodate large parties. Price: Most plates ranged from $-$, seafood dishes on the pricier end. Overall: The food was fair in taste and quality could've been better; nice service with a casual ambiance."
99,"I'm from El Salvador and I make the trip from SF to Berkeley to eat here. The food is on point. The decor is nice and the service is efficient. Their ensalada drink could use more fruit in it. Try salpicón, a chilled dish that you don't find everywhere. Pupusas de queso con loroco are yummy!"
100,"Came here last night after some recommendations from my family and loved it!As soon as we walked in the door, a waiter approached us and sat us down immediately. It was pretty crowded too, so this was great customer service. The service throughout our entire time there was great and I have no complaints!The food was amazing. I was born in El Salvador, so I know Salvadoran food when I taste it. Let me say this is true Salvadoran food. I ordered the pupusas with cheese and beans, and they were perfect! Abundance in size, not greasy, and a perfect blend of cheese and beans. I also ordered the horchata and it was good, a little too sweet for my liking but true Salvadoran horchata (tastes a little different than Mexican horchata for those of you unfamiliar.) My fiancée ordered the platillo típico which comes with two pupusas of your choice and rice and beans and he loved it too. My parents ordered a combination of the chicken sandwich, corn tamales, and yucca. I tried a little bit of everything and it satisfied all my cravings!If you are in the area, please do yourself a favor and come to this place. They have such a large variety of dishes to choose from and they depict Salvadoran cuisine to perfection!"
101,"Salvadoran restaurant. ...simple decore. Would rate food 4 stars, service 4 stars.....but bathroom so filthy had to drop overall rating.Dinner :  Pupusas 1 veggie 1 pork & cheese Delious!!! added there homemade slaw...Delicious treat. 5 star.Corn tamales. ..1 steamed , 1fried...Fried Tilapia platter with rice & platanos...yummy food."
102,"I love their pupusas and mangonada!I think they are very reasonably priced, $9.99 lunch menu.They are very accomodating for call-in orders.  I like to call my order in as I drive to the restaurant because I anm limited on lunch time and I like to get in before hteir lunch rush.I love their chicken and cheese pupusa, atol de elote beverage, and mangonada.Their entire menu looks delicious, but every time I visit I order the same thing, haha.I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is seeking delicious food!"
103,"Found Platano thanks to good ol' Yelp, and thank goodness I did because it was absolutely delicious.Came in with some friends for dinner and was immediately sat down. When looking over the menu, I realized that their lunch and dinner options were different instead of being the same and having dinner cost a bit more. This definitely surprised me because I feel like I don't see it often at casual restaurants such as Platano! The only thing that really seemed to be calling my name was #2 on the lunch menu which was two pupusas of your choice with a side avocado salad. I asked if I could order this for my dinner, and they said it was no problem but I would be charged more. I happily obliged :)I decided on the Revuelta (fried pork) and Queso y Loroco (Salvadoran flower). Both pupusas were phenomenal, perfect little pockets of heaven. It was only my second time having the food, but I feel confident in saying that these are some of the best I'll ever have in my life time. The salad was a great addition and balance of greens too, so I'm super thankful they allowed me to get this lunch item during dinner.All in all, delicious and good choice for a meal if you're in berkeley :)"
104,"I wasn't a fan the first time I went here. But after my last visit, I can safely say this is a great place for lunch or dinner if you ever find yourself on University Ave. From the outside, it doesn't seem to be that big of a restaurant. But walking in, there are a good amount of tables, with the restaurant extending to the back -- perfect for groups. The atmosphere is a little dingy, but lively nonetheless with paintings and decor to match the Latin American theme. For lunch, there are multiple options of combos that one can choose from pupusas, plantains, tamales,  side salad, and  sour cream and beans. The combinations are endless, and will satisfy those who want to try a bit of everything. My plate came with two pupusas, chicken tamales, and pickled vegetables. I got the revuelta pupusas which was filled with crispy tender pork, and cheese and also the beef and cheese. Essentially, they were a fried stuffed corn masa tortilla with meat and cheese inside. Alone, they were a bit bland with not a lot of seasoning but with a splash of hot sauce and some pickled vegetables the pupusas tasted much better. The chicken tamales was nothing special, but again with the some hot sauce and pickled vegetables it was really good. My friend got a side of sour cream and beans which i regret not getting, since dipping the pupusas in the sides made it even better!Overall, the prices are reasonable for the quality of food and portions are more than generous. My only complaint would be the service as it took over 30 mins to receive our food when it wasn't even that busy. If you never had El Salvadorian food, its a must try!"
105,"This was my second time coming to Platano, and it definitely didn't disappoint. The first time, I came for dinner, but this time it was for lunch. The vibe was a little different. There were more people during lunchtime, and the whole place felt livelier and brighter. Both my friend and I loved what we got the first time we came here, so we skipped over the lunch specials in favor of their full menu so that we could re-experience the deliciousness we remembered. I ordered the Albondigas, essentially meatballs in some kind of tomato sauce. The dish comes with two sides, so I ordered casamientos (a fried mixture of rice and black beans) and platanos (can't come to Platano without ordering platanos!). I noticed that on their dinner menu, platanos is not a side that is offered, which is a shame because they added a really nice balance to the meal as a whole. The meatballs were delicious - a good texture and perfectly seasoned. As for the sides, I definitely recommend casamientos and platanos. The casamientos are a more interesting version of rice, essentially, and the platanos added a bit of sweetness to the dish, which was perfect for me since I have a massive sweet tooth.My friend and I also ordered a papusa to share, which is essentially a stuffed corn masa tortilla. We chose the chicharron (fried pork) papusa, since it seemed to be The Thing to order here. I don't know if I would order the papusa again, but I'm glad I tried it. The breading was too thick for me and the filling wasn't that exciting. Service was okay, but we had to work a little bit to get their attention for the bill.Still, I'll definitely be coming back here next time!"
106,"VEGAN GLUTEN FREE REVIEW:I love Platano, or rather, their black bean pupusas, curtido, and salsa. The flavors are amazing and they're vegan and gluten free! Platano is my to-go-to place for comforting and delicious food; however, on my last visit there, I saw that they had risen the price for their pupusas. It was $2.50 for a pupusa but now, it's $2.90. For a black bean only pupusa, that's a little steep. I've been to places in San Jose that charge $1.50 per pupusa of the same size, so I feel kind of salty about the price increase. I'll continue to frequent Platano, but I hope they don't raise their prices again; otherwise, it's time to find another pupusaría."
107,"Dependable, nourishing Salvadorian fare served in a cozy, homey space in downtown Berkeley. The homey feel extends to the cooking here, which feels quite authentic. The carne desilada, for example, was a melange of pan-fried crispy shredded beef, eggs, tomato, onions, and bell peppers. Meanwhile, a glass of horchata was refreshing - not too sweet, but not bland - although it was full of ice. Service is courteous here, although as other reviewers have noted, it can take a while for things to come out. Nevertheless, if you want Latin American fare that's not expensive given what you get, not to mention dishes that won't feel like they're busting your gut, Platano is a solid choice."
108,"And we are back again at this selicious place. For those that may want some guidance on other than Pupusas, try the Salpicon with casamiento and sour cream..."
109,"This. Place. Is. Bomb. It's rare that a whole table will agree on one opinion about a restaurant, but no one had any complaints and everyone absolutely loved their food (see reference photo #1.  Total inhalation) Prices are super reasonable (especially for the quality of food you're getting) and portions are quite generous. I ordered the potato stew with re fried beans and a salad and everything was perfect. The stew wasn't as thick as traditional American stews but it packed a punch- seasoned well, full of flavor, super tender and still incredibly filling even without the hearty consistency I'm used to. Beans were awesome (I'm a sucker for re fried beans) and the salad added a nice fresh crunch to my whole meal (the citrusy dressing was a refreshing plus). Everyone at my table ate in silence because we couldn't be bothered with conversation when we were having a tastebud fiesta in our mouths."
110,"VEGAN REVIEW!So apparently, the black bean pupusas are vegan! I have been eating here for years (former Cal student) and I did not know this. I also order the Avocado Salad (no chips, no cheese, dressing on the side) which is also vegan. I imagine the fried plantains are also vegan. Overall, delicious food!"
111,"Pupusaaaaaaas!!!! Everytime I come here the pupusas are a must. I would recommend coming during lunch hours (11-2:30, I think) because they have $10 lunch plate specials which are some combination of 1-2 pupusas, fried plantains, and salad/beans/sour cream. I've tried the chicken, cheese, and zucchini/onion/cheese pupusas and really liked them all. The chicken is probably my favorite of the three. I've also tried the avocado salad and its incredibly filling and tasty."
112,"My favourite papusa and plantanos restaurant in the East Bay. Service, ambiance, quality of food and price met my expectation."
113,"Absolutely delicious and authentic pupusas here! My husband's family is Salvadorean so I know good pupusas when I see them. We got there a little later than our reservation and they were still very accommodating and served us fast. Ordered the Plato Tipico with One Revuelta and One Queso pupusa. They did not disappoint! We also tried their Pastelitos as an appetizer and they were so big, and delicious as well. Highly recommend this Salvadorean restaurant!"

142,"I love their pupusas and mangonada!I think they are very reasonably priced, $9.99 lunch menu.They are very accomodating for call-in orders.  I like to call my order in as I drive to the restaurant because I anm limited on lunch time and I like to get in before hteir lunch rush.I love their chicken and cheese pupusa, atol de elote beverage, and mangonada.Their entire menu looks delicious, but every time I visit I order the same thing, haha.I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is seeking delicious food!"
143,"Found Platano thanks to good ol' Yelp, and thank goodness I did because it was absolutely delicious.Came in with some friends for dinner and was immediately sat down. When looking over the menu, I realized that their lunch and dinner options were different instead of being the same and having dinner cost a bit more. This definitely surprised me because I feel like I don't see it often at casual restaurants such as Platano! The only thing that really seemed to be calling my name was #2 on the lunch menu which was two pupusas of your choice with a side avocado salad. I asked if I could order this for my dinner, and they said it was no problem but I would be charged more. I happily obliged :)I decided on the Revuelta (fried pork) and Queso y Loroco (Salvadoran flower). Both pupusas were phenomenal, perfect little pockets of heaven. It was only my second time having the food, but I feel confident in saying that these are some of the best I'll ever have in my life time. The salad was a great addition and balance of greens too, so I'm super thankful they allowed me to get this lunch item during dinner.All in all, delicious and good choice for a meal if you're in berkeley :)"
144,"I wasn't a fan the first time I went here. But after my last visit, I can safely say this is a great place for lunch or dinner if you ever find yourself on University Ave. From the outside, it doesn't seem to be that big of a restaurant. But walking in, there are a good amount of tables, with the restaurant extending to the back -- perfect for groups. The atmosphere is a little dingy, but lively nonetheless with paintings and decor to match the Latin American theme. For lunch, there are multiple options of combos that one can choose from pupusas, plantains, tamales,  side salad, and  sour cream and beans. The combinations are endless, and will satisfy those who want to try a bit of everything. My plate came with two pupusas, chicken tamales, and pickled vegetables. I got the revuelta pupusas which was filled with crispy tender pork, and cheese and also the beef and cheese. Essentially, they were a fried stuffed corn masa tortilla with meat and cheese inside. Alone, they were a bit bland with not a lot of seasoning but with a splash of hot sauce and some pickled vegetables the pupusas tasted much better. The chicken tamales was nothing special, but again with the some hot sauce and pickled vegetables it was really good. My friend got a side of sour cream and beans which i regret not getting, since dipping the pupusas in the sides made it even better!Overall, the prices are reasonable for the quality of food and portions are more than generous. My only complaint would be the service as it took over 30 mins to receive our food when it wasn't even that busy. If you never had El Salvadorian food, its a must try!"
145,"This was my second time coming to Platano, and it definitely didn't disappoint. The first time, I came for dinner, but this time it was for lunch. The vibe was a little different. There were more people during lunchtime, and the whole place felt livelier and brighter. Both my friend and I loved what we got the first time we came here, so we skipped over the lunch specials in favor of their full menu so that we could re-experience the deliciousness we remembered. I ordered the Albondigas, essentially meatballs in some kind of tomato sauce. The dish comes with two sides, so I ordered casamientos (a fried mixture of rice and black beans) and platanos (can't come to Platano without ordering platanos!). I noticed that on their dinner menu, platanos is not a side that is offered, which is a shame because they added a really nice balance to the meal as a whole. The meatballs were delicious - a good texture and perfectly seasoned. As for the sides, I definitely recommend casamientos and platanos. The casamientos are a more interesting version of rice, essentially, and the platanos added a bit of sweetness to the dish, which was perfect for me since I have a massive sweet tooth.My friend and I also ordered a papusa to share, which is essentially a stuffed corn masa tortilla. We chose the chicharron (fried pork) papusa, since it seemed to be The Thing to order here. I don't know if I would order the papusa again, but I'm glad I tried it. The breading was too thick for me and the filling wasn't that exciting. Service was okay, but we had to work a little bit to get their attention for the bill.Still, I'll definitely be coming back here next time!"
146,"VEGAN GLUTEN FREE REVIEW:I love Platano, or rather, their black bean pupusas, curtido, and salsa. The flavors are amazing and they're vegan and gluten free! Platano is my to-go-to place for comforting and delicious food; however, on my last visit there, I saw that they had risen the price for their pupusas. It was $2.50 for a pupusa but now, it's $2.90. For a black bean only pupusa, that's a little steep. I've been to places in San Jose that charge $1.50 per pupusa of the same size, so I feel kind of salty about the price increase. I'll continue to frequent Platano, but I hope they don't raise their prices again; otherwise, it's time to find another pupusaría."
147,"Dependable, nourishing Salvadorian fare served in a cozy, homey space in downtown Berkeley. The homey feel extends to the cooking here, which feels quite authentic. The carne desilada, for example, was a melange of pan-fried crispy shredded beef, eggs, tomato, onions, and bell peppers. Meanwhile, a glass of horchata was refreshing - not too sweet, but not bland - although it was full of ice. Service is courteous here, although as other reviewers have noted, it can take a while for things to come out. Nevertheless, if you want Latin American fare that's not expensive given what you get, not to mention dishes that won't feel like they're busting your gut, Platano is a solid choice."
148,"And we are back again at this selicious place. For those that may want some guidance on other than Pupusas, try the Salpicon with casamiento and sour cream..."
149,"This. Place. Is. Bomb. It's rare that a whole table will agree on one opinion about a restaurant, but no one had any complaints and everyone absolutely loved their food (see reference photo #1.  Total inhalation) Prices are super reasonable (especially for the quality of food you're getting) and portions are quite generous. I ordered the potato stew with re fried beans and a salad and everything was perfect. The stew wasn't as thick as traditional American stews but it packed a punch- seasoned well, full of flavor, super tender and still incredibly filling even without the hearty consistency I'm used to. Beans were awesome (I'm a sucker for re fried beans) and the salad added a nice fresh crunch to my whole meal (the citrusy dressing was a refreshing plus). Everyone at my table ate in silence because we couldn't be bothered with conversation when we were having a tastebud fiesta in our mouths."
150,"VEGAN REVIEW!So apparently, the black bean pupusas are vegan! I have been eating here for years (former Cal student) and I did not know this. I also order the Avocado Salad (no chips, no cheese, dressing on the side) which is also vegan. I imagine the fried plantains are also vegan. Overall, delicious food!"
151,"Pupusaaaaaaas!!!! Everytime I come here the pupusas are a must. I would recommend coming during lunch hours (11-2:30, I think) because they have $10 lunch plate specials which are some combination of 1-2 pupusas, fried plantains, and salad/beans/sour cream. I've tried the chicken, cheese, and zucchini/onion/cheese pupusas and really liked them all. The chicken is probably my favorite of the three. I've also tried the avocado salad and its incredibly filling and tasty."
152,"My favourite papusa and plantanos restaurant in the East Bay. Service, ambiance, quality of food and price met my expectation."
153,"Absolutely delicious and authentic pupusas here! My husband's family is Salvadorean so I know good pupusas when I see them. We got there a little later than our reservation and they were still very accommodating and served us fast. Ordered the Plato Tipico with One Revuelta and One Queso pupusa. They did not disappoint! We also tried their Pastelitos as an appetizer and they were so big, and delicious as well. Highly recommend this Salvadorean restaurant!"
154,"YUMMM! I've never had Salvadorian food until trying this place and now there's no going back for me. Location: It's right at the heart of University St so street parking can be a pain. There's a parking lot behind El Burro but it does get packed. If you're lucky though, you can find some street parking in the areas around university. Service: It looks small on the outside but inside it's quite large. I usually get seated really quickly regardless of how big of a group I come with. However, it can take some time for them to bring you water/refill it and for your order to get to your table once you order. Price: Some dishes can be pretty pricey but the reason to come here is for the pupusas! I think that when I first started coming here they were $2.5 and might have raised to $2.75. Food: My go tos are the ruvuelta and bean and cheese. I usually order only 2 since they're so filling! I always pair them with plantains too. YUMMM. With your meal they bring you some sauce and slaw. I believe there are two levels of the sauce, they usually bring you the milder one but if you ask they have a spicier version. I tend to finish a whole bottle when I go with friends. lol. Overall, a Berkeley gem that not only provides delicious food, but at a decent price."
155,"Got pupusas (the cheese and squash blossom and the cheese and beans) with fried plantains. It was really good! Will definitely be coming back again, and recommend it to anyone interested in an affordable, filling, and delicious meal!"
156,"Located near many different restaurants near the ""college b-town"" area . Small waiting area in front waiting to be seated but quick turn around service (larger tables in rear). I order the shrimp and steak  x convo with rice and the plate was big enough to share. I ordered the sangria which they ran out fruit for but got a double portion for it and it was still very good"
157,First time eating here and eating El Savadorian food. Food was real fresh and so good. Pupusas were so delicious. The bean and sour cream were so creamy.  Loved the plantains.Great service!! Will be going back soon!!
158,"The menu at Platano has plenty of options from light soups to dense plates. Food: I ordered the Ensalada de Aguacate (avocado), which was healthily portioned, vibrant, and aesthetically pleasing. The grilled chicken had a few fried pieces that were too charred for my liking, in other words burnt. I enjoyed the vinaigrette as it countered the creamy avocado, creating a nice balance. The two-piece pupusa combo plate was filling; one pupusa was filled with cheese and the other with pork and beans, the plate came with a few sides. The pupusas were warm on the interior and lightly fried on the outside, however the flavor was lacking and the cheese didn't quite melt enough. They had a microwave textural feel to them and were lacking freshness. We smothered them with crema, but I recommend topping it off with the coleslaw mix to allow the acidity to cut through the richness of the crema. Service: Friendly, but a bit slow. Our food took a while, fortunately we weren't starving.Ambiance: Large and casual restaurant with plenty of seating to accommodate large parties. Price: Most plates ranged from $-$, seafood dishes on the pricier end. Overall: The food was fair in taste and quality could've been better; nice service with a casual ambiance."
159,"I'm from El Salvador and I make the trip from SF to Berkeley to eat here. The food is on point. The decor is nice and the service is efficient. Their ensalada drink could use more fruit in it. Try salpicón, a chilled dish that you don't find everywhere. Pupusas de queso con loroco are yummy!"
160,"Came here last night after some recommendations from my family and loved it!As soon as we walked in the door, a waiter approached us and sat us down immediately. It was pretty crowded too, so this was great customer service. The service throughout our entire time there was great and I have no complaints!The food was amazing. I was born in El Salvador, so I know Salvadoran food when I taste it. Let me say this is true Salvadoran food. I ordered the pupusas with cheese and beans, and they were perfect! Abundance in size, not greasy, and a perfect blend of cheese and beans. I also ordered the horchata and it was good, a little too sweet for my liking but true Salvadoran horchata (tastes a little different than Mexican horchata for those of you unfamiliar.) My fiancée ordered the platillo típico which comes with two pupusas of your choice and rice and beans and he loved it too. My parents ordered a combination of the chicken sandwich, corn tamales, and yucca. I tried a little bit of everything and it satisfied all my cravings!If you are in the area, please do yourself a favor and come to this place. They have such a large variety of dishes to choose from and they depict Salvadoran cuisine to perfection!"

186,"VEGAN GLUTEN FREE REVIEW:I love Platano, or rather, their black bean pupusas, curtido, and salsa. The flavors are amazing and they're vegan and gluten free! Platano is my to-go-to place for comforting and delicious food; however, on my last visit there, I saw that they had risen the price for their pupusas. It was $2.50 for a pupusa but now, it's $2.90. For a black bean only pupusa, that's a little steep. I've been to places in San Jose that charge $1.50 per pupusa of the same size, so I feel kind of salty about the price increase. I'll continue to frequent Platano, but I hope they don't raise their prices again; otherwise, it's time to find another pupusaría."
187,"Dependable, nourishing Salvadorian fare served in a cozy, homey space in downtown Berkeley. The homey feel extends to the cooking here, which feels quite authentic. The carne desilada, for example, was a melange of pan-fried crispy shredded beef, eggs, tomato, onions, and bell peppers. Meanwhile, a glass of horchata was refreshing - not too sweet, but not bland - although it was full of ice. Service is courteous here, although as other reviewers have noted, it can take a while for things to come out. Nevertheless, if you want Latin American fare that's not expensive given what you get, not to mention dishes that won't feel like they're busting your gut, Platano is a solid choice."
188,"And we are back again at this selicious place. For those that may want some guidance on other than Pupusas, try the Salpicon with casamiento and sour cream..."
189,"This. Place. Is. Bomb. It's rare that a whole table will agree on one opinion about a restaurant, but no one had any complaints and everyone absolutely loved their food (see reference photo #1.  Total inhalation) Prices are super reasonable (especially for the quality of food you're getting) and portions are quite generous. I ordered the potato stew with re fried beans and a salad and everything was perfect. The stew wasn't as thick as traditional American stews but it packed a punch- seasoned well, full of flavor, super tender and still incredibly filling even without the hearty consistency I'm used to. Beans were awesome (I'm a sucker for re fried beans) and the salad added a nice fresh crunch to my whole meal (the citrusy dressing was a refreshing plus). Everyone at my table ate in silence because we couldn't be bothered with conversation when we were having a tastebud fiesta in our mouths."
190,"VEGAN REVIEW!So apparently, the black bean pupusas are vegan! I have been eating here for years (former Cal student) and I did not know this. I also order the Avocado Salad (no chips, no cheese, dressing on the side) which is also vegan. I imagine the fried plantains are also vegan. Overall, delicious food!"
191,"Pupusaaaaaaas!!!! Everytime I come here the pupusas are a must. I would recommend coming during lunch hours (11-2:30, I think) because they have $10 lunch plate specials which are some combination of 1-2 pupusas, fried plantains, and salad/beans/sour cream. I've tried the chicken, cheese, and zucchini/onion/cheese pupusas and really liked them all. The chicken is probably my favorite of the three. I've also tried the avocado salad and its incredibly filling and tasty."
192,"My favourite papusa and plantanos restaurant in the East Bay. Service, ambiance, quality of food and price met my expectation."
193,"Absolutely delicious and authentic pupusas here! My husband's family is Salvadorean so I know good pupusas when I see them. We got there a little later than our reservation and they were still very accommodating and served us fast. Ordered the Plato Tipico with One Revuelta and One Queso pupusa. They did not disappoint! We also tried their Pastelitos as an appetizer and they were so big, and delicious as well. Highly recommend this Salvadorean restaurant!"
194,"YUMMM! I've never had Salvadorian food until trying this place and now there's no going back for me. Location: It's right at the heart of University St so street parking can be a pain. There's a parking lot behind El Burro but it does get packed. If you're lucky though, you can find some street parking in the areas around university. Service: It looks small on the outside but inside it's quite large. I usually get seated really quickly regardless of how big of a group I come with. However, it can take some time for them to bring you water/refill it and for your order to get to your table once you order. Price: Some dishes can be pretty pricey but the reason to come here is for the pupusas! I think that when I first started coming here they were $2.5 and might have raised to $2.75. Food: My go tos are the ruvuelta and bean and cheese. I usually order only 2 since they're so filling! I always pair them with plantains too. YUMMM. With your meal they bring you some sauce and slaw. I believe there are two levels of the sauce, they usually bring you the milder one but if you ask they have a spicier version. I tend to finish a whole bottle when I go with friends. lol. Overall, a Berkeley gem that not only provides delicious food, but at a decent price."
195,"Got pupusas (the cheese and squash blossom and the cheese and beans) with fried plantains. It was really good! Will definitely be coming back again, and recommend it to anyone interested in an affordable, filling, and delicious meal!"
196,"Located near many different restaurants near the ""college b-town"" area . Small waiting area in front waiting to be seated but quick turn around service (larger tables in rear). I order the shrimp and steak  x convo with rice and the plate was big enough to share. I ordered the sangria which they ran out fruit for but got a double portion for it and it was still very good"
197,First time eating here and eating El Savadorian food. Food was real fresh and so good. Pupusas were so delicious. The bean and sour cream were so creamy.  Loved the plantains.Great service!! Will be going back soon!!
198,"The menu at Platano has plenty of options from light soups to dense plates. Food: I ordered the Ensalada de Aguacate (avocado), which was healthily portioned, vibrant, and aesthetically pleasing. The grilled chicken had a few fried pieces that were too charred for my liking, in other words burnt. I enjoyed the vinaigrette as it countered the creamy avocado, creating a nice balance. The two-piece pupusa combo plate was filling; one pupusa was filled with cheese and the other with pork and beans, the plate came with a few sides. The pupusas were warm on the interior and lightly fried on the outside, however the flavor was lacking and the cheese didn't quite melt enough. They had a microwave textural feel to them and were lacking freshness. We smothered them with crema, but I recommend topping it off with the coleslaw mix to allow the acidity to cut through the richness of the crema. Service: Friendly, but a bit slow. Our food took a while, fortunately we weren't starving.Ambiance: Large and casual restaurant with plenty of seating to accommodate large parties. Price: Most plates ranged from $-$, seafood dishes on the pricier end. Overall: The food was fair in taste and quality could've been better; nice service with a casual ambiance."
199,"I'm from El Salvador and I make the trip from SF to Berkeley to eat here. The food is on point. The decor is nice and the service is efficient. Their ensalada drink could use more fruit in it. Try salpicón, a chilled dish that you don't find everywhere. Pupusas de queso con loroco are yummy!"
200,"Came here last night after some recommendations from my family and loved it!As soon as we walked in the door, a waiter approached us and sat us down immediately. It was pretty crowded too, so this was great customer service. The service throughout our entire time there was great and I have no complaints!The food was amazing. I was born in El Salvador, so I know Salvadoran food when I taste it. Let me say this is true Salvadoran food. I ordered the pupusas with cheese and beans, and they were perfect! Abundance in size, not greasy, and a perfect blend of cheese and beans. I also ordered the horchata and it was good, a little too sweet for my liking but true Salvadoran horchata (tastes a little different than Mexican horchata for those of you unfamiliar.) My fiancée ordered the platillo típico which comes with two pupusas of your choice and rice and beans and he loved it too. My parents ordered a combination of the chicken sandwich, corn tamales, and yucca. I tried a little bit of everything and it satisfied all my cravings!If you are in the area, please do yourself a favor and come to this place. They have such a large variety of dishes to choose from and they depict Salvadoran cuisine to perfection!"
201,"Salvadoran restaurant. ...simple decore. Would rate food 4 stars, service 4 stars.....but bathroom so filthy had to drop overall rating.Dinner :  Pupusas 1 veggie 1 pork & cheese Delious!!! added there homemade slaw...Delicious treat. 5 star.Corn tamales. ..1 steamed , 1fried...Fried Tilapia platter with rice & platanos...yummy food."
202,"I love their pupusas and mangonada!I think they are very reasonably priced, $9.99 lunch menu.They are very accomodating for call-in orders.  I like to call my order in as I drive to the restaurant because I anm limited on lunch time and I like to get in before hteir lunch rush.I love their chicken and cheese pupusa, atol de elote beverage, and mangonada.Their entire menu looks delicious, but every time I visit I order the same thing, haha.I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is seeking delicious food!"
203,"Found Platano thanks to good ol' Yelp, and thank goodness I did because it was absolutely delicious.Came in with some friends for dinner and was immediately sat down. When looking over the menu, I realized that their lunch and dinner options were different instead of being the same and having dinner cost a bit more. This definitely surprised me because I feel like I don't see it often at casual restaurants such as Platano! The only thing that really seemed to be calling my name was #2 on the lunch menu which was two pupusas of your choice with a side avocado salad. I asked if I could order this for my dinner, and they said it was no problem but I would be charged more. I happily obliged :)I decided on the Revuelta (fried pork) and Queso y Loroco (Salvadoran flower). Both pupusas were phenomenal, perfect little pockets of heaven. It was only my second time having the food, but I feel confident in saying that these are some of the best I'll ever have in my life time. The salad was a great addition and balance of greens too, so I'm super thankful they allowed me to get this lunch item during dinner.All in all, delicious and good choice for a meal if you're in berkeley :)"
204,"I wasn't a fan the first time I went here. But after my last visit, I can safely say this is a great place for lunch or dinner if you ever find yourself on University Ave. From the outside, it doesn't seem to be that big of a restaurant. But walking in, there are a good amount of tables, with the restaurant extending to the back -- perfect for groups. The atmosphere is a little dingy, but lively nonetheless with paintings and decor to match the Latin American theme. For lunch, there are multiple options of combos that one can choose from pupusas, plantains, tamales,  side salad, and  sour cream and beans. The combinations are endless, and will satisfy those who want to try a bit of everything. My plate came with two pupusas, chicken tamales, and pickled vegetables. I got the revuelta pupusas which was filled with crispy tender pork, and cheese and also the beef and cheese. Essentially, they were a fried stuffed corn masa tortilla with meat and cheese inside. Alone, they were a bit bland with not a lot of seasoning but with a splash of hot sauce and some pickled vegetables the pupusas tasted much better. The chicken tamales was nothing special, but again with the some hot sauce and pickled vegetables it was really good. My friend got a side of sour cream and beans which i regret not getting, since dipping the pupusas in the sides made it even better!Overall, the prices are reasonable for the quality of food and portions are more than generous. My only complaint would be the service as it took over 30 mins to receive our food when it wasn't even that busy. If you never had El Salvadorian food, its a must try!"
205,"This was my second time coming to Platano, and it definitely didn't disappoint. The first time, I came for dinner, but this time it was for lunch. The vibe was a little different. There were more people during lunchtime, and the whole place felt livelier and brighter. Both my friend and I loved what we got the first time we came here, so we skipped over the lunch specials in favor of their full menu so that we could re-experience the deliciousness we remembered. I ordered the Albondigas, essentially meatballs in some kind of tomato sauce. The dish comes with two sides, so I ordered casamientos (a fried mixture of rice and black beans) and platanos (can't come to Platano without ordering platanos!). I noticed that on their dinner menu, platanos is not a side that is offered, which is a shame because they added a really nice balance to the meal as a whole. The meatballs were delicious - a good texture and perfectly seasoned. As for the sides, I definitely recommend casamientos and platanos. The casamientos are a more interesting version of rice, essentially, and the platanos added a bit of sweetness to the dish, which was perfect for me since I have a massive sweet tooth.My friend and I also ordered a papusa to share, which is essentially a stuffed corn masa tortilla. We chose the chicharron (fried pork) papusa, since it seemed to be The Thing to order here. I don't know if I would order the papusa again, but I'm glad I tried it. The breading was too thick for me and the filling wasn't that exciting. Service was okay, but we had to work a little bit to get their attention for the bill.Still, I'll definitely be coming back here next time!"

I believe there are two levels of the sauce, they usually bring you the milder one but if you ask they have a spicier version. I tend to finish a whole bottle when I go with friends. lol. Overall, a Berkeley gem that not only provides delicious food, but at a decent price."
235,"Got pupusas (the cheese and squash blossom and the cheese and beans) with fried plantains. It was really good! Will definitely be coming back again, and recommend it to anyone interested in an affordable, filling, and delicious meal!"
236,"Located near many different restaurants near the ""college b-town"" area . Small waiting area in front waiting to be seated but quick turn around service (larger tables in rear). I order the shrimp and steak  x convo with rice and the plate was big enough to share. I ordered the sangria which they ran out fruit for but got a double portion for it and it was still very good"
237,First time eating here and eating El Savadorian food. Food was real fresh and so good. Pupusas were so delicious. The bean and sour cream were so creamy.  Loved the plantains.Great service!! Will be going back soon!!
238,"The menu at Platano has plenty of options from light soups to dense plates. Food: I ordered the Ensalada de Aguacate (avocado), which was healthily portioned, vibrant, and aesthetically pleasing. The grilled chicken had a few fried pieces that were too charred for my liking, in other words burnt. I enjoyed the vinaigrette as it countered the creamy avocado, creating a nice balance. The two-piece pupusa combo plate was filling; one pupusa was filled with cheese and the other with pork and beans, the plate came with a few sides. The pupusas were warm on the interior and lightly fried on the outside, however the flavor was lacking and the cheese didn't quite melt enough. They had a microwave textural feel to them and were lacking freshness. We smothered them with crema, but I recommend topping it off with the coleslaw mix to allow the acidity to cut through the richness of the crema. Service: Friendly, but a bit slow. Our food took a while, fortunately we weren't starving.Ambiance: Large and casual restaurant with plenty of seating to accommodate large parties. Price: Most plates ranged from $-$, seafood dishes on the pricier end. Overall: The food was fair in taste and quality could've been better; nice service with a casual ambiance."
239,"I'm from El Salvador and I make the trip from SF to Berkeley to eat here. The food is on point. The decor is nice and the service is efficient. Their ensalada drink could use more fruit in it. Try salpicón, a chilled dish that you don't find everywhere. Pupusas de queso con loroco are yummy!"
240,"Came here last night after some recommendations from my family and loved it!As soon as we walked in the door, a waiter approached us and sat us down immediately. It was pretty crowded too, so this was great customer service. The service throughout our entire time there was great and I have no complaints!The food was amazing. I was born in El Salvador, so I know Salvadoran food when I taste it. Let me say this is true Salvadoran food. I ordered the pupusas with cheese and beans, and they were perfect! Abundance in size, not greasy, and a perfect blend of cheese and beans. I also ordered the horchata and it was good, a little too sweet for my liking but true Salvadoran horchata (tastes a little different than Mexican horchata for those of you unfamiliar.) My fiancée ordered the platillo típico which comes with two pupusas of your choice and rice and beans and he loved it too. My parents ordered a combination of the chicken sandwich, corn tamales, and yucca. I tried a little bit of everything and it satisfied all my cravings!If you are in the area, please do yourself a favor and come to this place. They have such a large variety of dishes to choose from and they depict Salvadoran cuisine to perfection!"
241,"Salvadoran restaurant. ...simple decore. Would rate food 4 stars, service 4 stars.....but bathroom so filthy had to drop overall rating.Dinner :  Pupusas 1 veggie 1 pork & cheese Delious!!! added there homemade slaw...Delicious treat. 5 star.Corn tamales. ..1 steamed , 1fried...Fried Tilapia platter with rice & platanos...yummy food."
242,"I love their pupusas and mangonada!I think they are very reasonably priced, $9.99 lunch menu.They are very accomodating for call-in orders.  I like to call my order in as I drive to the restaurant because I anm limited on lunch time and I like to get in before hteir lunch rush.I love their chicken and cheese pupusa, atol de elote beverage, and mangonada.Their entire menu looks delicious, but every time I visit I order the same thing, haha.I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is seeking delicious food!"
243,"Found Platano thanks to good ol' Yelp, and thank goodness I did because it was absolutely delicious.Came in with some friends for dinner and was immediately sat down. When looking over the menu, I realized that their lunch and dinner options were different instead of being the same and having dinner cost a bit more. This definitely surprised me because I feel like I don't see it often at casual restaurants such as Platano! The only thing that really seemed to be calling my name was #2 on the lunch menu which was two pupusas of your choice with a side avocado salad. I asked if I could order this for my dinner, and they said it was no problem but I would be charged more. I happily obliged :)I decided on the Revuelta (fried pork) and Queso y Loroco (Salvadoran flower). Both pupusas were phenomenal, perfect little pockets of heaven. It was only my second time having the food, but I feel confident in saying that these are some of the best I'll ever have in my life time. The salad was a great addition and balance of greens too, so I'm super thankful they allowed me to get this lunch item during dinner.All in all, delicious and good choice for a meal if you're in berkeley :)"
244,"I wasn't a fan the first time I went here. But after my last visit, I can safely say this is a great place for lunch or dinner if you ever find yourself on University Ave. From the outside, it doesn't seem to be that big of a restaurant. But walking in, there are a good amount of tables, with the restaurant extending to the back -- perfect for groups. The atmosphere is a little dingy, but lively nonetheless with paintings and decor to match the Latin American theme. For lunch, there are multiple options of combos that one can choose from pupusas, plantains, tamales,  side salad, and  sour cream and beans. The combinations are endless, and will satisfy those who want to try a bit of everything. My plate came with two pupusas, chicken tamales, and pickled vegetables. I got the revuelta pupusas which was filled with crispy tender pork, and cheese and also the beef and cheese. Essentially, they were a fried stuffed corn masa tortilla with meat and cheese inside. Alone, they were a bit bland with not a lot of seasoning but with a splash of hot sauce and some pickled vegetables the pupusas tasted much better. The chicken tamales was nothing special, but again with the some hot sauce and pickled vegetables it was really good. My friend got a side of sour cream and beans which i regret not getting, since dipping the pupusas in the sides made it even better!Overall, the prices are reasonable for the quality of food and portions are more than generous. My only complaint would be the service as it took over 30 mins to receive our food when it wasn't even that busy. If you never had El Salvadorian food, its a must try!"
245,"This was my second time coming to Platano, and it definitely didn't disappoint. The first time, I came for dinner, but this time it was for lunch. The vibe was a little different. There were more people during lunchtime, and the whole place felt livelier and brighter. Both my friend and I loved what we got the first time we came here, so we skipped over the lunch specials in favor of their full menu so that we could re-experience the deliciousness we remembered. I ordered the Albondigas, essentially meatballs in some kind of tomato sauce. The dish comes with two sides, so I ordered casamientos (a fried mixture of rice and black beans) and platanos (can't come to Platano without ordering platanos!). I noticed that on their dinner menu, platanos is not a side that is offered, which is a shame because they added a really nice balance to the meal as a whole. The meatballs were delicious - a good texture and perfectly seasoned. As for the sides, I definitely recommend casamientos and platanos. The casamientos are a more interesting version of rice, essentially, and the platanos added a bit of sweetness to the dish, which was perfect for me since I have a massive sweet tooth.My friend and I also ordered a papusa to share, which is essentially a stuffed corn masa tortilla. We chose the chicharron (fried pork) papusa, since it seemed to be The Thing to order here. I don't know if I would order the papusa again, but I'm glad I tried it. The breading was too thick for me and the filling wasn't that exciting. Service was okay, but we had to work a little bit to get their attention for the bill.Still, I'll definitely be coming back here next time!"
246,"VEGAN GLUTEN FREE REVIEW:I love Platano, or rather, their black bean pupusas, curtido, and salsa. The flavors are amazing and they're vegan and gluten free! Platano is my to-go-to place for comforting and delicious food; however, on my last visit there, I saw that they had risen the price for their pupusas. It was $2.50 for a pupusa but now, it's $2.90. For a black bean only pupusa, that's a little steep. I've been to places in San Jose that charge $1.50 per pupusa of the same size, so I feel kind of salty about the price increase. I'll continue to frequent Platano, but I hope they don't raise their prices again; otherwise, it's time to find another pupusaría."
247,"Dependable, nourishing Salvadorian fare served in a cozy, homey space in downtown Berkeley. The homey feel extends to the cooking here, which feels quite authentic. The carne desilada, for example, was a melange of pan-fried crispy shredded beef, eggs, tomato, onions, and bell peppers. Meanwhile, a glass of horchata was refreshing - not too sweet, but not bland - although it was full of ice. Service is courteous here, although as other reviewers have noted, it can take a while for things to come out. Nevertheless, if you want Latin American fare that's not expensive given what you get, not to mention dishes that won't feel like they're busting your gut, Platano is a solid choice."
248,"And we are back again at this selicious place. For those that may want some guidance on other than Pupusas, try the Salpicon with casamiento and sour cream..."
249,"This. Place. Is. Bomb. It's rare that a whole table will agree on one opinion about a restaurant, but no one had any complaints and everyone absolutely loved their food (see reference photo #1.  Total inhalation) Prices are super reasonable (especially for the quality of food you're getting) and portions are quite generous. I ordered the potato stew with re fried beans and a salad and everything was perfect. The stew wasn't as thick as traditional American stews but it packed a punch- seasoned well, full of flavor, super tender and still incredibly filling even without the hearty consistency I'm used to. Beans were awesome (I'm a sucker for re fried beans) and the salad added a nice fresh crunch to my whole meal (the citrusy dressing was a refreshing plus). Everyone at my table ate in silence because we couldn't be bothered with conversation when we were having a tastebud fiesta in our mouths."
250,"VEGAN REVIEW!So apparently, the black bean pupusas are vegan! I have been eating here for years (former Cal student) and I did not know this. I also order the Avocado Salad (no chips, no cheese, dressing on the side) which is also vegan. I imagine the fried plantains are also vegan. Overall, delicious food!"
251,"Pupusaaaaaaas!!!! Everytime I come here the pupusas are a must. I would recommend coming during lunch hours (11-2:30, I think) because they have $10 lunch plate specials which are some combination of 1-2 pupusas, fried plantains, and salad/beans/sour cream. I've tried the chicken, cheese, and zucchini/onion/cheese pupusas and really liked them all. The chicken is probably my favorite of the three. I've also tried the avocado salad and its incredibly filling and tasty."
252,"My favourite papusa and plantanos restaurant in the East Bay. Service, ambiance, quality of food and price met my expectation."
253,"Absolutely delicious and authentic pupusas here! My husband's family is Salvadorean so I know good pupusas when I see them. We got there a little later than our reservation and they were still very accommodating and served us fast. Ordered the Plato Tipico with One Revuelta and One Queso pupusa. They did not disappoint! We also tried their Pastelitos as an appetizer and they were so big, and delicious as well. Highly recommend this Salvadorean restaurant!"
254,"YUMMM! I've never had Salvadorian food until trying this place and now there's no going back for me. Location: It's right at the heart of University St so street parking can be a pain. There's a parking lot behind El Burro but it does get packed. If you're lucky though, you can find some street parking in the areas around university. Service: It looks small on the outside but inside it's quite large. I usually get seated really quickly regardless of how big of a group I come with. However, it can take some time for them to bring you water/refill it and for your order to get to your table once you order. Price: Some dishes can be pretty pricey but the reason to come here is for the pupusas! I think that when I first started coming here they were $2.5 and might have raised to $2.75.

When looking over the menu, I realized that their lunch and dinner options were different instead of being the same and having dinner cost a bit more. This definitely surprised me because I feel like I don't see it often at casual restaurants such as Platano! The only thing that really seemed to be calling my name was #2 on the lunch menu which was two pupusas of your choice with a side avocado salad. I asked if I could order this for my dinner, and they said it was no problem but I would be charged more. I happily obliged :)I decided on the Revuelta (fried pork) and Queso y Loroco (Salvadoran flower). Both pupusas were phenomenal, perfect little pockets of heaven. It was only my second time having the food, but I feel confident in saying that these are some of the best I'll ever have in my life time. The salad was a great addition and balance of greens too, so I'm super thankful they allowed me to get this lunch item during dinner.All in all, delicious and good choice for a meal if you're in berkeley :)"
284,"I wasn't a fan the first time I went here. But after my last visit, I can safely say this is a great place for lunch or dinner if you ever find yourself on University Ave. From the outside, it doesn't seem to be that big of a restaurant. But walking in, there are a good amount of tables, with the restaurant extending to the back -- perfect for groups. The atmosphere is a little dingy, but lively nonetheless with paintings and decor to match the Latin American theme. For lunch, there are multiple options of combos that one can choose from pupusas, plantains, tamales,  side salad, and  sour cream and beans. The combinations are endless, and will satisfy those who want to try a bit of everything. My plate came with two pupusas, chicken tamales, and pickled vegetables. I got the revuelta pupusas which was filled with crispy tender pork, and cheese and also the beef and cheese. Essentially, they were a fried stuffed corn masa tortilla with meat and cheese inside. Alone, they were a bit bland with not a lot of seasoning but with a splash of hot sauce and some pickled vegetables the pupusas tasted much better. The chicken tamales was nothing special, but again with the some hot sauce and pickled vegetables it was really good. My friend got a side of sour cream and beans which i regret not getting, since dipping the pupusas in the sides made it even better!Overall, the prices are reasonable for the quality of food and portions are more than generous. My only complaint would be the service as it took over 30 mins to receive our food when it wasn't even that busy. If you never had El Salvadorian food, its a must try!"
285,"This was my second time coming to Platano, and it definitely didn't disappoint. The first time, I came for dinner, but this time it was for lunch. The vibe was a little different. There were more people during lunchtime, and the whole place felt livelier and brighter. Both my friend and I loved what we got the first time we came here, so we skipped over the lunch specials in favor of their full menu so that we could re-experience the deliciousness we remembered. I ordered the Albondigas, essentially meatballs in some kind of tomato sauce. The dish comes with two sides, so I ordered casamientos (a fried mixture of rice and black beans) and platanos (can't come to Platano without ordering platanos!). I noticed that on their dinner menu, platanos is not a side that is offered, which is a shame because they added a really nice balance to the meal as a whole. The meatballs were delicious - a good texture and perfectly seasoned. As for the sides, I definitely recommend casamientos and platanos. The casamientos are a more interesting version of rice, essentially, and the platanos added a bit of sweetness to the dish, which was perfect for me since I have a massive sweet tooth.My friend and I also ordered a papusa to share, which is essentially a stuffed corn masa tortilla. We chose the chicharron (fried pork) papusa, since it seemed to be The Thing to order here. I don't know if I would order the papusa again, but I'm glad I tried it. The breading was too thick for me and the filling wasn't that exciting. Service was okay, but we had to work a little bit to get their attention for the bill.Still, I'll definitely be coming back here next time!"
286,"VEGAN GLUTEN FREE REVIEW:I love Platano, or rather, their black bean pupusas, curtido, and salsa. The flavors are amazing and they're vegan and gluten free! Platano is my to-go-to place for comforting and delicious food; however, on my last visit there, I saw that they had risen the price for their pupusas. It was $2.50 for a pupusa but now, it's $2.90. For a black bean only pupusa, that's a little steep. I've been to places in San Jose that charge $1.50 per pupusa of the same size, so I feel kind of salty about the price increase. I'll continue to frequent Platano, but I hope they don't raise their prices again; otherwise, it's time to find another pupusaría."
287,"Dependable, nourishing Salvadorian fare served in a cozy, homey space in downtown Berkeley. The homey feel extends to the cooking here, which feels quite authentic. The carne desilada, for example, was a melange of pan-fried crispy shredded beef, eggs, tomato, onions, and bell peppers. Meanwhile, a glass of horchata was refreshing - not too sweet, but not bland - although it was full of ice. Service is courteous here, although as other reviewers have noted, it can take a while for things to come out. Nevertheless, if you want Latin American fare that's not expensive given what you get, not to mention dishes that won't feel like they're busting your gut, Platano is a solid choice."
288,"And we are back again at this selicious place. For those that may want some guidance on other than Pupusas, try the Salpicon with casamiento and sour cream..."
289,"This. Place. Is. Bomb. It's rare that a whole table will agree on one opinion about a restaurant, but no one had any complaints and everyone absolutely loved their food (see reference photo #1.  Total inhalation) Prices are super reasonable (especially for the quality of food you're getting) and portions are quite generous. I ordered the potato stew with re fried beans and a salad and everything was perfect. The stew wasn't as thick as traditional American stews but it packed a punch- seasoned well, full of flavor, super tender and still incredibly filling even without the hearty consistency I'm used to. Beans were awesome (I'm a sucker for re fried beans) and the salad added a nice fresh crunch to my whole meal (the citrusy dressing was a refreshing plus). Everyone at my table ate in silence because we couldn't be bothered with conversation when we were having a tastebud fiesta in our mouths."
290,"VEGAN REVIEW!So apparently, the black bean pupusas are vegan! I have been eating here for years (former Cal student) and I did not know this. I also order the Avocado Salad (no chips, no cheese, dressing on the side) which is also vegan. I imagine the fried plantains are also vegan. Overall, delicious food!"
291,"Pupusaaaaaaas!!!! Everytime I come here the pupusas are a must. I would recommend coming during lunch hours (11-2:30, I think) because they have $10 lunch plate specials which are some combination of 1-2 pupusas, fried plantains, and salad/beans/sour cream. I've tried the chicken, cheese, and zucchini/onion/cheese pupusas and really liked them all. The chicken is probably my favorite of the three. I've also tried the avocado salad and its incredibly filling and tasty."
292,"My favourite papusa and plantanos restaurant in the East Bay. Service, ambiance, quality of food and price met my expectation."
293,"Absolutely delicious and authentic pupusas here! My husband's family is Salvadorean so I know good pupusas when I see them. We got there a little later than our reservation and they were still very accommodating and served us fast. Ordered the Plato Tipico with One Revuelta and One Queso pupusa. They did not disappoint! We also tried their Pastelitos as an appetizer and they were so big, and delicious as well. Highly recommend this Salvadorean restaurant!"
294,"YUMMM! I've never had Salvadorian food until trying this place and now there's no going back for me. Location: It's right at the heart of University St so street parking can be a pain. There's a parking lot behind El Burro but it does get packed. If you're lucky though, you can find some street parking in the areas around university. Service: It looks small on the outside but inside it's quite large. I usually get seated really quickly regardless of how big of a group I come with. However, it can take some time for them to bring you water/refill it and for your order to get to your table once you order. Price: Some dishes can be pretty pricey but the reason to come here is for the pupusas! I think that when I first started coming here they were $2.5 and might have raised to $2.75. Food: My go tos are the ruvuelta and bean and cheese. I usually order only 2 since they're so filling! I always pair them with plantains too. YUMMM. With your meal they bring you some sauce and slaw. I believe there are two levels of the sauce, they usually bring you the milder one but if you ask they have a spicier version. I tend to finish a whole bottle when I go with friends. lol. Overall, a Berkeley gem that not only provides delicious food, but at a decent price."
295,"Got pupusas (the cheese and squash blossom and the cheese and beans) with fried plantains. It was really good! Will definitely be coming back again, and recommend it to anyone interested in an affordable, filling, and delicious meal!"
296,"Located near many different restaurants near the ""college b-town"" area . Small waiting area in front waiting to be seated but quick turn around service (larger tables in rear). I order the shrimp and steak  x convo with rice and the plate was big enough to share. I ordered the sangria which they ran out fruit for but got a double portion for it and it was still very good"
297,First time eating here and eating El Savadorian food. Food was real fresh and so good. Pupusas were so delicious. The bean and sour cream were so creamy.  Loved the plantains.Great service!! Will be going back soon!!
298,"The menu at Platano has plenty of options from light soups to dense plates. Food: I ordered the Ensalada de Aguacate (avocado), which was healthily portioned, vibrant, and aesthetically pleasing. The grilled chicken had a few fried pieces that were too charred for my liking, in other words burnt. I enjoyed the vinaigrette as it countered the creamy avocado, creating a nice balance. The two-piece pupusa combo plate was filling; one pupusa was filled with cheese and the other with pork and beans, the plate came with a few sides. The pupusas were warm on the interior and lightly fried on the outside, however the flavor was lacking and the cheese didn't quite melt enough. They had a microwave textural feel to them and were lacking freshness. We smothered them with crema, but I recommend topping it off with the coleslaw mix to allow the acidity to cut through the richness of the crema. Service: Friendly, but a bit slow. Our food took a while, fortunately we weren't starving.Ambiance: Large and casual restaurant with plenty of seating to accommodate large parties. Price: Most plates ranged from $-$, seafood dishes on the pricier end. Overall: The food was fair in taste and quality could've been better; nice service with a casual ambiance."
299,"I'm from El Salvador and I make the trip from SF to Berkeley to eat here. The food is on point. The decor is nice and the service is efficient. Their ensalada drink could use more fruit in it. Try salpicón, a chilled dish that you don't find everywhere. Pupusas de queso con loroco are yummy!"
300,"Came here last night after some recommendations from my family and loved it!As soon as we walked in the door, a waiter approached us and sat us down immediately. It was pretty crowded too, so this was great customer service. The service throughout our entire time there was great and I have no complaints!The food was amazing. I was born in El Salvador, so I know Salvadoran food when I taste it. Let me say this is true Salvadoran food. I ordered the pupusas with cheese and beans, and they were perfect! Abundance in size, not greasy, and a perfect blend of cheese and beans. I also ordered the horchata and it was good, a little too sweet for my liking but true Salvadoran horchata (tastes a little different than Mexican horchata for those of you unfamiliar.) My fiancée ordered the platillo típico which comes with two pupusas of your choice and rice and beans and he loved it too. My parents ordered a combination of the chicken sandwich, corn tamales, and yucca. I tried a little bit of everything and it satisfied all my cravings!If you are in the area, please do yourself a favor and come to this place. They have such a large variety of dishes to choose from and they depict Salvadoran cuisine to perfection!"
301,"Salvadoran restaurant. ...simple decore. Would rate food 4 stars, service 4 stars.....but bathroom so filthy had to drop overall rating.Dinner :  Pupusas 1 veggie 1 pork & cheese Delious!!! added there homemade slaw...Delicious treat. 5 star.Corn tamales. ..1 steamed , 1fried...Fried Tilapia platter with rice & platanos...yummy food."

Platano is my to-go-to place for comforting and delicious food; however, on my last visit there, I saw that they had risen the price for their pupusas. It was $2.50 for a pupusa but now, it's $2.90. For a black bean only pupusa, that's a little steep. I've been to places in San Jose that charge $1.50 per pupusa of the same size, so I feel kind of salty about the price increase. I'll continue to frequent Platano, but I hope they don't raise their prices again; otherwise, it's time to find another pupusaría."
327,"Dependable, nourishing Salvadorian fare served in a cozy, homey space in downtown Berkeley. The homey feel extends to the cooking here, which feels quite authentic. The carne desilada, for example, was a melange of pan-fried crispy shredded beef, eggs, tomato, onions, and bell peppers. Meanwhile, a glass of horchata was refreshing - not too sweet, but not bland - although it was full of ice. Service is courteous here, although as other reviewers have noted, it can take a while for things to come out. Nevertheless, if you want Latin American fare that's not expensive given what you get, not to mention dishes that won't feel like they're busting your gut, Platano is a solid choice."
328,"And we are back again at this selicious place. For those that may want some guidance on other than Pupusas, try the Salpicon with casamiento and sour cream..."
329,"This. Place. Is. Bomb. It's rare that a whole table will agree on one opinion about a restaurant, but no one had any complaints and everyone absolutely loved their food (see reference photo #1.  Total inhalation) Prices are super reasonable (especially for the quality of food you're getting) and portions are quite generous. I ordered the potato stew with re fried beans and a salad and everything was perfect. The stew wasn't as thick as traditional American stews but it packed a punch- seasoned well, full of flavor, super tender and still incredibly filling even without the hearty consistency I'm used to. Beans were awesome (I'm a sucker for re fried beans) and the salad added a nice fresh crunch to my whole meal (the citrusy dressing was a refreshing plus). Everyone at my table ate in silence because we couldn't be bothered with conversation when we were having a tastebud fiesta in our mouths."
330,"VEGAN REVIEW!So apparently, the black bean pupusas are vegan! I have been eating here for years (former Cal student) and I did not know this. I also order the Avocado Salad (no chips, no cheese, dressing on the side) which is also vegan. I imagine the fried plantains are also vegan. Overall, delicious food!"
331,"Pupusaaaaaaas!!!! Everytime I come here the pupusas are a must. I would recommend coming during lunch hours (11-2:30, I think) because they have $10 lunch plate specials which are some combination of 1-2 pupusas, fried plantains, and salad/beans/sour cream. I've tried the chicken, cheese, and zucchini/onion/cheese pupusas and really liked them all. The chicken is probably my favorite of the three. I've also tried the avocado salad and its incredibly filling and tasty."
332,"My favourite papusa and plantanos restaurant in the East Bay. Service, ambiance, quality of food and price met my expectation."
333,"Absolutely delicious and authentic pupusas here! My husband's family is Salvadorean so I know good pupusas when I see them. We got there a little later than our reservation and they were still very accommodating and served us fast. Ordered the Plato Tipico with One Revuelta and One Queso pupusa. They did not disappoint! We also tried their Pastelitos as an appetizer and they were so big, and delicious as well. Highly recommend this Salvadorean restaurant!"
334,"YUMMM! I've never had Salvadorian food until trying this place and now there's no going back for me. Location: It's right at the heart of University St so street parking can be a pain. There's a parking lot behind El Burro but it does get packed. If you're lucky though, you can find some street parking in the areas around university. Service: It looks small on the outside but inside it's quite large. I usually get seated really quickly regardless of how big of a group I come with. However, it can take some time for them to bring you water/refill it and for your order to get to your table once you order. Price: Some dishes can be pretty pricey but the reason to come here is for the pupusas! I think that when I first started coming here they were $2.5 and might have raised to $2.75. Food: My go tos are the ruvuelta and bean and cheese. I usually order only 2 since they're so filling! I always pair them with plantains too. YUMMM. With your meal they bring you some sauce and slaw. I believe there are two levels of the sauce, they usually bring you the milder one but if you ask they have a spicier version. I tend to finish a whole bottle when I go with friends. lol. Overall, a Berkeley gem that not only provides delicious food, but at a decent price."
335,"Got pupusas (the cheese and squash blossom and the cheese and beans) with fried plantains. It was really good! Will definitely be coming back again, and recommend it to anyone interested in an affordable, filling, and delicious meal!"
336,"Located near many different restaurants near the ""college b-town"" area . Small waiting area in front waiting to be seated but quick turn around service (larger tables in rear). I order the shrimp and steak  x convo with rice and the plate was big enough to share. I ordered the sangria which they ran out fruit for but got a double portion for it and it was still very good"
337,First time eating here and eating El Savadorian food. Food was real fresh and so good. Pupusas were so delicious. The bean and sour cream were so creamy.  Loved the plantains.Great service!! Will be going back soon!!
338,"The menu at Platano has plenty of options from light soups to dense plates. Food: I ordered the Ensalada de Aguacate (avocado), which was healthily portioned, vibrant, and aesthetically pleasing. The grilled chicken had a few fried pieces that were too charred for my liking, in other words burnt. I enjoyed the vinaigrette as it countered the creamy avocado, creating a nice balance. The two-piece pupusa combo plate was filling; one pupusa was filled with cheese and the other with pork and beans, the plate came with a few sides. The pupusas were warm on the interior and lightly fried on the outside, however the flavor was lacking and the cheese didn't quite melt enough. They had a microwave textural feel to them and were lacking freshness. We smothered them with crema, but I recommend topping it off with the coleslaw mix to allow the acidity to cut through the richness of the crema. Service: Friendly, but a bit slow. Our food took a while, fortunately we weren't starving.Ambiance: Large and casual restaurant with plenty of seating to accommodate large parties. Price: Most plates ranged from $-$, seafood dishes on the pricier end. Overall: The food was fair in taste and quality could've been better; nice service with a casual ambiance."
339,"I'm from El Salvador and I make the trip from SF to Berkeley to eat here. The food is on point. The decor is nice and the service is efficient. Their ensalada drink could use more fruit in it. Try salpicón, a chilled dish that you don't find everywhere. Pupusas de queso con loroco are yummy!"
340,"Came here last night after some recommendations from my family and loved it!As soon as we walked in the door, a waiter approached us and sat us down immediately. It was pretty crowded too, so this was great customer service. The service throughout our entire time there was great and I have no complaints!The food was amazing. I was born in El Salvador, so I know Salvadoran food when I taste it. Let me say this is true Salvadoran food. I ordered the pupusas with cheese and beans, and they were perfect! Abundance in size, not greasy, and a perfect blend of cheese and beans. I also ordered the horchata and it was good, a little too sweet for my liking but true Salvadoran horchata (tastes a little different than Mexican horchata for those of you unfamiliar.) My fiancée ordered the platillo típico which comes with two pupusas of your choice and rice and beans and he loved it too. My parents ordered a combination of the chicken sandwich, corn tamales, and yucca. I tried a little bit of everything and it satisfied all my cravings!If you are in the area, please do yourself a favor and come to this place. They have such a large variety of dishes to choose from and they depict Salvadoran cuisine to perfection!"
341,"Salvadoran restaurant. ...simple decore. Would rate food 4 stars, service 4 stars.....but bathroom so filthy had to drop overall rating.Dinner :  Pupusas 1 veggie 1 pork & cheese Delious!!! added there homemade slaw...Delicious treat. 5 star.Corn tamales. ..1 steamed , 1fried...Fried Tilapia platter with rice & platanos...yummy food."
342,"I love their pupusas and mangonada!I think they are very reasonably priced, $9.99 lunch menu.They are very accomodating for call-in orders.  I like to call my order in as I drive to the restaurant because I anm limited on lunch time and I like to get in before hteir lunch rush.I love their chicken and cheese pupusa, atol de elote beverage, and mangonada.Their entire menu looks delicious, but every time I visit I order the same thing, haha.I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is seeking delicious food!"
343,"Found Platano thanks to good ol' Yelp, and thank goodness I did because it was absolutely delicious.Came in with some friends for dinner and was immediately sat down. When looking over the menu, I realized that their lunch and dinner options were different instead of being the same and having dinner cost a bit more. This definitely surprised me because I feel like I don't see it often at casual restaurants such as Platano! The only thing that really seemed to be calling my name was #2 on the lunch menu which was two pupusas of your choice with a side avocado salad. I asked if I could order this for my dinner, and they said it was no problem but I would be charged more. I happily obliged :)I decided on the Revuelta (fried pork) and Queso y Loroco (Salvadoran flower). Both pupusas were phenomenal, perfect little pockets of heaven. It was only my second time having the food, but I feel confident in saying that these are some of the best I'll ever have in my life time. The salad was a great addition and balance of greens too, so I'm super thankful they allowed me to get this lunch item during dinner.All in all, delicious and good choice for a meal if you're in berkeley :)"
344,"I wasn't a fan the first time I went here. But after my last visit, I can safely say this is a great place for lunch or dinner if you ever find yourself on University Ave. From the outside, it doesn't seem to be that big of a restaurant. But walking in, there are a good amount of tables, with the restaurant extending to the back -- perfect for groups. The atmosphere is a little dingy, but lively nonetheless with paintings and decor to match the Latin American theme. For lunch, there are multiple options of combos that one can choose from pupusas, plantains, tamales,  side salad, and  sour cream and beans. The combinations are endless, and will satisfy those who want to try a bit of everything. My plate came with two pupusas, chicken tamales, and pickled vegetables. I got the revuelta pupusas which was filled with crispy tender pork, and cheese and also the beef and cheese. Essentially, they were a fried stuffed corn masa tortilla with meat and cheese inside. Alone, they were a bit bland with not a lot of seasoning but with a splash of hot sauce and some pickled vegetables the pupusas tasted much better. The chicken tamales was nothing special, but again with the some hot sauce and pickled vegetables it was really good. My friend got a side of sour cream and beans which i regret not getting, since dipping the pupusas in the sides made it even better!Overall, the prices are reasonable for the quality of food and portions are more than generous. My only complaint would be the service as it took over 30 mins to receive our food when it wasn't even that busy. If you never had El Salvadorian food, its a must try!"
345,"This was my second time coming to Platano, and it definitely didn't disappoint. The first time, I came for dinner, but this time it was for lunch. The vibe was a little different. There were more people during lunchtime, and the whole place felt livelier and brighter. Both my friend and I loved what we got the first time we came here, so we skipped over the lunch specials in favor of their full menu so that we could re-experience the deliciousness we remembered. I ordered the Albondigas, essentially meatballs in some kind of tomato sauce. The dish comes with two sides, so I ordered casamientos (a fried mixture of rice and black beans) and platanos (can't come to Platano without ordering platanos!). I noticed that on their dinner menu, platanos is not a side that is offered, which is a shame because they added a really nice balance to the meal as a whole. The meatballs were delicious - a good texture and perfectly seasoned. As for the sides, I definitely recommend casamientos and platanos. The casamientos are a more interesting version of rice, essentially, and the platanos added a bit of sweetness to the dish, which was perfect for me since I have a massive sweet tooth.My friend and I also ordered a papusa to share, which is essentially a stuffed corn masa tortilla. We chose the chicharron (fried pork) papusa, since it seemed to be The Thing to order here. I don't know if I would order the papusa again, but I'm glad I tried it. The breading was too thick for me and the filling wasn't that exciting. Service was okay, but we had to work a little bit to get their attention for the bill.Still, I'll definitely be coming back here next time!"

I believe there are two levels of the sauce, they usually bring you the milder one but if you ask they have a spicier version. I tend to finish a whole bottle when I go with friends. lol. Overall, a Berkeley gem that not only provides delicious food, but at a decent price."
375,"Got pupusas (the cheese and squash blossom and the cheese and beans) with fried plantains. It was really good! Will definitely be coming back again, and recommend it to anyone interested in an affordable, filling, and delicious meal!"
376,"Located near many different restaurants near the ""college b-town"" area . Small waiting area in front waiting to be seated but quick turn around service (larger tables in rear). I order the shrimp and steak  x convo with rice and the plate was big enough to share. I ordered the sangria which they ran out fruit for but got a double portion for it and it was still very good"
377,First time eating here and eating El Savadorian food. Food was real fresh and so good. Pupusas were so delicious. The bean and sour cream were so creamy.  Loved the plantains.Great service!! Will be going back soon!!
378,"The menu at Platano has plenty of options from light soups to dense plates. Food: I ordered the Ensalada de Aguacate (avocado), which was healthily portioned, vibrant, and aesthetically pleasing. The grilled chicken had a few fried pieces that were too charred for my liking, in other words burnt. I enjoyed the vinaigrette as it countered the creamy avocado, creating a nice balance. The two-piece pupusa combo plate was filling; one pupusa was filled with cheese and the other with pork and beans, the plate came with a few sides. The pupusas were warm on the interior and lightly fried on the outside, however the flavor was lacking and the cheese didn't quite melt enough. They had a microwave textural feel to them and were lacking freshness. We smothered them with crema, but I recommend topping it off with the coleslaw mix to allow the acidity to cut through the richness of the crema. Service: Friendly, but a bit slow. Our food took a while, fortunately we weren't starving.Ambiance: Large and casual restaurant with plenty of seating to accommodate large parties. Price: Most plates ranged from $-$, seafood dishes on the pricier end. Overall: The food was fair in taste and quality could've been better; nice service with a casual ambiance."
379,"I'm from El Salvador and I make the trip from SF to Berkeley to eat here. The food is on point. The decor is nice and the service is efficient. Their ensalada drink could use more fruit in it. Try salpicón, a chilled dish that you don't find everywhere. Pupusas de queso con loroco are yummy!"
380,"Came here last night after some recommendations from my family and loved it!As soon as we walked in the door, a waiter approached us and sat us down immediately. It was pretty crowded too, so this was great customer service. The service throughout our entire time there was great and I have no complaints!The food was amazing. I was born in El Salvador, so I know Salvadoran food when I taste it. Let me say this is true Salvadoran food. I ordered the pupusas with cheese and beans, and they were perfect! Abundance in size, not greasy, and a perfect blend of cheese and beans. I also ordered the horchata and it was good, a little too sweet for my liking but true Salvadoran horchata (tastes a little different than Mexican horchata for those of you unfamiliar.) My fiancée ordered the platillo típico which comes with two pupusas of your choice and rice and beans and he loved it too. My parents ordered a combination of the chicken sandwich, corn tamales, and yucca. I tried a little bit of everything and it satisfied all my cravings!If you are in the area, please do yourself a favor and come to this place. They have such a large variety of dishes to choose from and they depict Salvadoran cuisine to perfection!"
381,"Salvadoran restaurant. ...simple decore. Would rate food 4 stars, service 4 stars.....but bathroom so filthy had to drop overall rating.Dinner :  Pupusas 1 veggie 1 pork & cheese Delious!!! added there homemade slaw...Delicious treat. 5 star.Corn tamales. ..1 steamed , 1fried...Fried Tilapia platter with rice & platanos...yummy food."
382,"I love their pupusas and mangonada!I think they are very reasonably priced, $9.99 lunch menu.They are very accomodating for call-in orders.  I like to call my order in as I drive to the restaurant because I anm limited on lunch time and I like to get in before hteir lunch rush.I love their chicken and cheese pupusa, atol de elote beverage, and mangonada.Their entire menu looks delicious, but every time I visit I order the same thing, haha.I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is seeking delicious food!"
383,"Found Platano thanks to good ol' Yelp, and thank goodness I did because it was absolutely delicious.Came in with some friends for dinner and was immediately sat down. When looking over the menu, I realized that their lunch and dinner options were different instead of being the same and having dinner cost a bit more. This definitely surprised me because I feel like I don't see it often at casual restaurants such as Platano! The only thing that really seemed to be calling my name was #2 on the lunch menu which was two pupusas of your choice with a side avocado salad. I asked if I could order this for my dinner, and they said it was no problem but I would be charged more. I happily obliged :)I decided on the Revuelta (fried pork) and Queso y Loroco (Salvadoran flower). Both pupusas were phenomenal, perfect little pockets of heaven. It was only my second time having the food, but I feel confident in saying that these are some of the best I'll ever have in my life time. The salad was a great addition and balance of greens too, so I'm super thankful they allowed me to get this lunch item during dinner.All in all, delicious and good choice for a meal if you're in berkeley :)"
384,"I wasn't a fan the first time I went here. But after my last visit, I can safely say this is a great place for lunch or dinner if you ever find yourself on University Ave. From the outside, it doesn't seem to be that big of a restaurant. But walking in, there are a good amount of tables, with the restaurant extending to the back -- perfect for groups. The atmosphere is a little dingy, but lively nonetheless with paintings and decor to match the Latin American theme. For lunch, there are multiple options of combos that one can choose from pupusas, plantains, tamales,  side salad, and  sour cream and beans. The combinations are endless, and will satisfy those who want to try a bit of everything. My plate came with two pupusas, chicken tamales, and pickled vegetables. I got the revuelta pupusas which was filled with crispy tender pork, and cheese and also the beef and cheese. Essentially, they were a fried stuffed corn masa tortilla with meat and cheese inside. Alone, they were a bit bland with not a lot of seasoning but with a splash of hot sauce and some pickled vegetables the pupusas tasted much better. The chicken tamales was nothing special, but again with the some hot sauce and pickled vegetables it was really good. My friend got a side of sour cream and beans which i regret not getting, since dipping the pupusas in the sides made it even better!Overall, the prices are reasonable for the quality of food and portions are more than generous. My only complaint would be the service as it took over 30 mins to receive our food when it wasn't even that busy. If you never had El Salvadorian food, its a must try!"
385,"This was my second time coming to Platano, and it definitely didn't disappoint. The first time, I came for dinner, but this time it was for lunch. The vibe was a little different. There were more people during lunchtime, and the whole place felt livelier and brighter. Both my friend and I loved what we got the first time we came here, so we skipped over the lunch specials in favor of their full menu so that we could re-experience the deliciousness we remembered. I ordered the Albondigas, essentially meatballs in some kind of tomato sauce. The dish comes with two sides, so I ordered casamientos (a fried mixture of rice and black beans) and platanos (can't come to Platano without ordering platanos!). I noticed that on their dinner menu, platanos is not a side that is offered, which is a shame because they added a really nice balance to the meal as a whole. The meatballs were delicious - a good texture and perfectly seasoned. As for the sides, I definitely recommend casamientos and platanos. The casamientos are a more interesting version of rice, essentially, and the platanos added a bit of sweetness to the dish, which was perfect for me since I have a massive sweet tooth.My friend and I also ordered a papusa to share, which is essentially a stuffed corn masa tortilla. We chose the chicharron (fried pork) papusa, since it seemed to be The Thing to order here. I don't know if I would order the papusa again, but I'm glad I tried it. The breading was too thick for me and the filling wasn't that exciting. Service was okay, but we had to work a little bit to get their attention for the bill.Still, I'll definitely be coming back here next time!"
386,"VEGAN GLUTEN FREE REVIEW:I love Platano, or rather, their black bean pupusas, curtido, and salsa. The flavors are amazing and they're vegan and gluten free! Platano is my to-go-to place for comforting and delicious food; however, on my last visit there, I saw that they had risen the price for their pupusas. It was $2.50 for a pupusa but now, it's $2.90. For a black bean only pupusa, that's a little steep. I've been to places in San Jose that charge $1.50 per pupusa of the same size, so I feel kind of salty about the price increase. I'll continue to frequent Platano, but I hope they don't raise their prices again; otherwise, it's time to find another pupusaría."
387,"Dependable, nourishing Salvadorian fare served in a cozy, homey space in downtown Berkeley. The homey feel extends to the cooking here, which feels quite authentic. The carne desilada, for example, was a melange of pan-fried crispy shredded beef, eggs, tomato, onions, and bell peppers. Meanwhile, a glass of horchata was refreshing - not too sweet, but not bland - although it was full of ice. Service is courteous here, although as other reviewers have noted, it can take a while for things to come out. Nevertheless, if you want Latin American fare that's not expensive given what you get, not to mention dishes that won't feel like they're busting your gut, Platano is a solid choice."
388,"And we are back again at this selicious place. For those that may want some guidance on other than Pupusas, try the Salpicon with casamiento and sour cream..."
389,"This. Place. Is. Bomb. It's rare that a whole table will agree on one opinion about a restaurant, but no one had any complaints and everyone absolutely loved their food (see reference photo #1.  Total inhalation) Prices are super reasonable (especially for the quality of food you're getting) and portions are quite generous. I ordered the potato stew with re fried beans and a salad and everything was perfect. The stew wasn't as thick as traditional American stews but it packed a punch- seasoned well, full of flavor, super tender and still incredibly filling even without the hearty consistency I'm used to. Beans were awesome (I'm a sucker for re fried beans) and the salad added a nice fresh crunch to my whole meal (the citrusy dressing was a refreshing plus). Everyone at my table ate in silence because we couldn't be bothered with conversation when we were having a tastebud fiesta in our mouths."
390,"VEGAN REVIEW!So apparently, the black bean pupusas are vegan! I have been eating here for years (former Cal student) and I did not know this. I also order the Avocado Salad (no chips, no cheese, dressing on the side) which is also vegan. I imagine the fried plantains are also vegan. Overall, delicious food!"
391,"Pupusaaaaaaas!!!! Everytime I come here the pupusas are a must. I would recommend coming during lunch hours (11-2:30, I think) because they have $10 lunch plate specials which are some combination of 1-2 pupusas, fried plantains, and salad/beans/sour cream. I've tried the chicken, cheese, and zucchini/onion/cheese pupusas and really liked them all. The chicken is probably my favorite of the three. I've also tried the avocado salad and its incredibly filling and tasty."
392,"My favourite papusa and plantanos restaurant in the East Bay. Service, ambiance, quality of food and price met my expectation."
393,"Absolutely delicious and authentic pupusas here! My husband's family is Salvadorean so I know good pupusas when I see them. We got there a little later than our reservation and they were still very accommodating and served us fast. Ordered the Plato Tipico with One Revuelta and One Queso pupusa. They did not disappoint! We also tried their Pastelitos as an appetizer and they were so big, and delicious as well. Highly recommend this Salvadorean restaurant!"
394,"YUMMM! I've never had Salvadorian food until trying this place and now there's no going back for me. Location: It's right at the heart of University St so street parking can be a pain. There's a parking lot behind El Burro but it does get packed. If you're lucky though, you can find some street parking in the areas around university. Service: It looks small on the outside but inside it's quite large. I usually get seated really quickly regardless of how big of a group I come with. However, it can take some time for them to bring you water/refill it and for your order to get to your table once you order. Price: Some dishes can be pretty pricey but the reason to come here is for the pupusas! I think that when I first started coming here they were $2.5 and might have raised to $2.75.

When looking over the menu, I realized that their lunch and dinner options were different instead of being the same and having dinner cost a bit more. This definitely surprised me because I feel like I don't see it often at casual restaurants such as Platano! The only thing that really seemed to be calling my name was #2 on the lunch menu which was two pupusas of your choice with a side avocado salad. I asked if I could order this for my dinner, and they said it was no problem but I would be charged more. I happily obliged :)I decided on the Revuelta (fried pork) and Queso y Loroco (Salvadoran flower). Both pupusas were phenomenal, perfect little pockets of heaven. It was only my second time having the food, but I feel confident in saying that these are some of the best I'll ever have in my life time. The salad was a great addition and balance of greens too, so I'm super thankful they allowed me to get this lunch item during dinner.All in all, delicious and good choice for a meal if you're in berkeley :)"
424,"I wasn't a fan the first time I went here. But after my last visit, I can safely say this is a great place for lunch or dinner if you ever find yourself on University Ave. From the outside, it doesn't seem to be that big of a restaurant. But walking in, there are a good amount of tables, with the restaurant extending to the back -- perfect for groups. The atmosphere is a little dingy, but lively nonetheless with paintings and decor to match the Latin American theme. For lunch, there are multiple options of combos that one can choose from pupusas, plantains, tamales,  side salad, and  sour cream and beans. The combinations are endless, and will satisfy those who want to try a bit of everything. My plate came with two pupusas, chicken tamales, and pickled vegetables. I got the revuelta pupusas which was filled with crispy tender pork, and cheese and also the beef and cheese. Essentially, they were a fried stuffed corn masa tortilla with meat and cheese inside. Alone, they were a bit bland with not a lot of seasoning but with a splash of hot sauce and some pickled vegetables the pupusas tasted much better. The chicken tamales was nothing special, but again with the some hot sauce and pickled vegetables it was really good. My friend got a side of sour cream and beans which i regret not getting, since dipping the pupusas in the sides made it even better!Overall, the prices are reasonable for the quality of food and portions are more than generous. My only complaint would be the service as it took over 30 mins to receive our food when it wasn't even that busy. If you never had El Salvadorian food, its a must try!"
425,"This was my second time coming to Platano, and it definitely didn't disappoint. The first time, I came for dinner, but this time it was for lunch. The vibe was a little different. There were more people during lunchtime, and the whole place felt livelier and brighter. Both my friend and I loved what we got the first time we came here, so we skipped over the lunch specials in favor of their full menu so that we could re-experience the deliciousness we remembered. I ordered the Albondigas, essentially meatballs in some kind of tomato sauce. The dish comes with two sides, so I ordered casamientos (a fried mixture of rice and black beans) and platanos (can't come to Platano without ordering platanos!). I noticed that on their dinner menu, platanos is not a side that is offered, which is a shame because they added a really nice balance to the meal as a whole. The meatballs were delicious - a good texture and perfectly seasoned. As for the sides, I definitely recommend casamientos and platanos. The casamientos are a more interesting version of rice, essentially, and the platanos added a bit of sweetness to the dish, which was perfect for me since I have a massive sweet tooth.My friend and I also ordered a papusa to share, which is essentially a stuffed corn masa tortilla. We chose the chicharron (fried pork) papusa, since it seemed to be The Thing to order here. I don't know if I would order the papusa again, but I'm glad I tried it. The breading was too thick for me and the filling wasn't that exciting. Service was okay, but we had to work a little bit to get their attention for the bill.Still, I'll definitely be coming back here next time!"
426,"VEGAN GLUTEN FREE REVIEW:I love Platano, or rather, their black bean pupusas, curtido, and salsa. The flavors are amazing and they're vegan and gluten free! Platano is my to-go-to place for comforting and delicious food; however, on my last visit there, I saw that they had risen the price for their pupusas. It was $2.50 for a pupusa but now, it's $2.90. For a black bean only pupusa, that's a little steep. I've been to places in San Jose that charge $1.50 per pupusa of the same size, so I feel kind of salty about the price increase. I'll continue to frequent Platano, but I hope they don't raise their prices again; otherwise, it's time to find another pupusaría."
427,"Dependable, nourishing Salvadorian fare served in a cozy, homey space in downtown Berkeley. The homey feel extends to the cooking here, which feels quite authentic. The carne desilada, for example, was a melange of pan-fried crispy shredded beef, eggs, tomato, onions, and bell peppers. Meanwhile, a glass of horchata was refreshing - not too sweet, but not bland - although it was full of ice. Service is courteous here, although as other reviewers have noted, it can take a while for things to come out. Nevertheless, if you want Latin American fare that's not expensive given what you get, not to mention dishes that won't feel like they're busting your gut, Platano is a solid choice."
428,"And we are back again at this selicious place. For those that may want some guidance on other than Pupusas, try the Salpicon with casamiento and sour cream..."
429,"This. Place. Is. Bomb. It's rare that a whole table will agree on one opinion about a restaurant, but no one had any complaints and everyone absolutely loved their food (see reference photo #1.  Total inhalation) Prices are super reasonable (especially for the quality of food you're getting) and portions are quite generous. I ordered the potato stew with re fried beans and a salad and everything was perfect. The stew wasn't as thick as traditional American stews but it packed a punch- seasoned well, full of flavor, super tender and still incredibly filling even without the hearty consistency I'm used to. Beans were awesome (I'm a sucker for re fried beans) and the salad added a nice fresh crunch to my whole meal (the citrusy dressing was a refreshing plus). Everyone at my table ate in silence because we couldn't be bothered with conversation when we were having a tastebud fiesta in our mouths."
430,"VEGAN REVIEW!So apparently, the black bean pupusas are vegan! I have been eating here for years (former Cal student) and I did not know this. I also order the Avocado Salad (no chips, no cheese, dressing on the side) which is also vegan. I imagine the fried plantains are also vegan. Overall, delicious food!"
431,"Pupusaaaaaaas!!!! Everytime I come here the pupusas are a must. I would recommend coming during lunch hours (11-2:30, I think) because they have $10 lunch plate specials which are some combination of 1-2 pupusas, fried plantains, and salad/beans/sour cream. I've tried the chicken, cheese, and zucchini/onion/cheese pupusas and really liked them all. The chicken is probably my favorite of the three. I've also tried the avocado salad and its incredibly filling and tasty."
432,"My favourite papusa and plantanos restaurant in the East Bay. Service, ambiance, quality of food and price met my expectation."
433,"Absolutely delicious and authentic pupusas here! My husband's family is Salvadorean so I know good pupusas when I see them. We got there a little later than our reservation and they were still very accommodating and served us fast. Ordered the Plato Tipico with One Revuelta and One Queso pupusa. They did not disappoint! We also tried their Pastelitos as an appetizer and they were so big, and delicious as well. Highly recommend this Salvadorean restaurant!"
434,"YUMMM! I've never had Salvadorian food until trying this place and now there's no going back for me. Location: It's right at the heart of University St so street parking can be a pain. There's a parking lot behind El Burro but it does get packed. If you're lucky though, you can find some street parking in the areas around university. Service: It looks small on the outside but inside it's quite large. I usually get seated really quickly regardless of how big of a group I come with. However, it can take some time for them to bring you water/refill it and for your order to get to your table once you order. Price: Some dishes can be pretty pricey but the reason to come here is for the pupusas! I think that when I first started coming here they were $2.5 and might have raised to $2.75. Food: My go tos are the ruvuelta and bean and cheese. I usually order only 2 since they're so filling! I always pair them with plantains too. YUMMM. With your meal they bring you some sauce and slaw. I believe there are two levels of the sauce, they usually bring you the milder one but if you ask they have a spicier version. I tend to finish a whole bottle when I go with friends. lol. Overall, a Berkeley gem that not only provides delicious food, but at a decent price."
435,"Got pupusas (the cheese and squash blossom and the cheese and beans) with fried plantains. It was really good! Will definitely be coming back again, and recommend it to anyone interested in an affordable, filling, and delicious meal!"
436,"Located near many different restaurants near the ""college b-town"" area . Small waiting area in front waiting to be seated but quick turn around service (larger tables in rear). I order the shrimp and steak  x convo with rice and the plate was big enough to share. I ordered the sangria which they ran out fruit for but got a double portion for it and it was still very good"
437,First time eating here and eating El Savadorian food. Food was real fresh and so good. Pupusas were so delicious. The bean and sour cream were so creamy.  Loved the plantains.Great service!! Will be going back soon!!
438,"The menu at Platano has plenty of options from light soups to dense plates. Food: I ordered the Ensalada de Aguacate (avocado), which was healthily portioned, vibrant, and aesthetically pleasing. The grilled chicken had a few fried pieces that were too charred for my liking, in other words burnt. I enjoyed the vinaigrette as it countered the creamy avocado, creating a nice balance. The two-piece pupusa combo plate was filling; one pupusa was filled with cheese and the other with pork and beans, the plate came with a few sides. The pupusas were warm on the interior and lightly fried on the outside, however the flavor was lacking and the cheese didn't quite melt enough. They had a microwave textural feel to them and were lacking freshness. We smothered them with crema, but I recommend topping it off with the coleslaw mix to allow the acidity to cut through the richness of the crema. Service: Friendly, but a bit slow. Our food took a while, fortunately we weren't starving.Ambiance: Large and casual restaurant with plenty of seating to accommodate large parties. Price: Most plates ranged from $-$, seafood dishes on the pricier end. Overall: The food was fair in taste and quality could've been better; nice service with a casual ambiance."
439,"I'm from El Salvador and I make the trip from SF to Berkeley to eat here. The food is on point. The decor is nice and the service is efficient. Their ensalada drink could use more fruit in it. Try salpicón, a chilled dish that you don't find everywhere. Pupusas de queso con loroco are yummy!"
440,"Came here last night after some recommendations from my family and loved it!As soon as we walked in the door, a waiter approached us and sat us down immediately. It was pretty crowded too, so this was great customer service. The service throughout our entire time there was great and I have no complaints!The food was amazing. I was born in El Salvador, so I know Salvadoran food when I taste it. Let me say this is true Salvadoran food. I ordered the pupusas with cheese and beans, and they were perfect! Abundance in size, not greasy, and a perfect blend of cheese and beans. I also ordered the horchata and it was good, a little too sweet for my liking but true Salvadoran horchata (tastes a little different than Mexican horchata for those of you unfamiliar.) My fiancée ordered the platillo típico which comes with two pupusas of your choice and rice and beans and he loved it too. My parents ordered a combination of the chicken sandwich, corn tamales, and yucca. I tried a little bit of everything and it satisfied all my cravings!If you are in the area, please do yourself a favor and come to this place. They have such a large variety of dishes to choose from and they depict Salvadoran cuisine to perfection!"
441,"Salvadoran restaurant. ...simple decore. Would rate food 4 stars, service 4 stars.....but bathroom so filthy had to drop overall rating.Dinner :  Pupusas 1 veggie 1 pork & cheese Delious!!! added there homemade slaw...Delicious treat. 5 star.Corn tamales. ..1 steamed , 1fried...Fried Tilapia platter with rice & platanos...yummy food."

Platano is my to-go-to place for comforting and delicious food; however, on my last visit there, I saw that they had risen the price for their pupusas. It was $2.50 for a pupusa but now, it's $2.90. For a black bean only pupusa, that's a little steep. I've been to places in San Jose that charge $1.50 per pupusa of the same size, so I feel kind of salty about the price increase. I'll continue to frequent Platano, but I hope they don't raise their prices again; otherwise, it's time to find another pupusaría."
467,"Dependable, nourishing Salvadorian fare served in a cozy, homey space in downtown Berkeley. The homey feel extends to the cooking here, which feels quite authentic. The carne desilada, for example, was a melange of pan-fried crispy shredded beef, eggs, tomato, onions, and bell peppers. Meanwhile, a glass of horchata was refreshing - not too sweet, but not bland - although it was full of ice. Service is courteous here, although as other reviewers have noted, it can take a while for things to come out. Nevertheless, if you want Latin American fare that's not expensive given what you get, not to mention dishes that won't feel like they're busting your gut, Platano is a solid choice."
468,"And we are back again at this selicious place. For those that may want some guidance on other than Pupusas, try the Salpicon with casamiento and sour cream..."
469,"This. Place. Is. Bomb. It's rare that a whole table will agree on one opinion about a restaurant, but no one had any complaints and everyone absolutely loved their food (see reference photo #1.  Total inhalation) Prices are super reasonable (especially for the quality of food you're getting) and portions are quite generous. I ordered the potato stew with re fried beans and a salad and everything was perfect. The stew wasn't as thick as traditional American stews but it packed a punch- seasoned well, full of flavor, super tender and still incredibly filling even without the hearty consistency I'm used to. Beans were awesome (I'm a sucker for re fried beans) and the salad added a nice fresh crunch to my whole meal (the citrusy dressing was a refreshing plus). Everyone at my table ate in silence because we couldn't be bothered with conversation when we were having a tastebud fiesta in our mouths."
470,"VEGAN REVIEW!So apparently, the black bean pupusas are vegan! I have been eating here for years (former Cal student) and I did not know this. I also order the Avocado Salad (no chips, no cheese, dressing on the side) which is also vegan. I imagine the fried plantains are also vegan. Overall, delicious food!"
471,"Pupusaaaaaaas!!!! Everytime I come here the pupusas are a must. I would recommend coming during lunch hours (11-2:30, I think) because they have $10 lunch plate specials which are some combination of 1-2 pupusas, fried plantains, and salad/beans/sour cream. I've tried the chicken, cheese, and zucchini/onion/cheese pupusas and really liked them all. The chicken is probably my favorite of the three. I've also tried the avocado salad and its incredibly filling and tasty."
472,"My favourite papusa and plantanos restaurant in the East Bay. Service, ambiance, quality of food and price met my expectation."
473,"Absolutely delicious and authentic pupusas here! My husband's family is Salvadorean so I know good pupusas when I see them. We got there a little later than our reservation and they were still very accommodating and served us fast. Ordered the Plato Tipico with One Revuelta and One Queso pupusa. They did not disappoint! We also tried their Pastelitos as an appetizer and they were so big, and delicious as well. Highly recommend this Salvadorean restaurant!"
474,"YUMMM! I've never had Salvadorian food until trying this place and now there's no going back for me. Location: It's right at the heart of University St so street parking can be a pain. There's a parking lot behind El Burro but it does get packed. If you're lucky though, you can find some street parking in the areas around university. Service: It looks small on the outside but inside it's quite large. I usually get seated really quickly regardless of how big of a group I come with. However, it can take some time for them to bring you water/refill it and for your order to get to your table once you order. Price: Some dishes can be pretty pricey but the reason to come here is for the pupusas! I think that when I first started coming here they were $2.5 and might have raised to $2.75. Food: My go tos are the ruvuelta and bean and cheese. I usually order only 2 since they're so filling! I always pair them with plantains too. YUMMM. With your meal they bring you some sauce and slaw. I believe there are two levels of the sauce, they usually bring you the milder one but if you ask they have a spicier version. I tend to finish a whole bottle when I go with friends. lol. Overall, a Berkeley gem that not only provides delicious food, but at a decent price."
475,"Got pupusas (the cheese and squash blossom and the cheese and beans) with fried plantains. It was really good! Will definitely be coming back again, and recommend it to anyone interested in an affordable, filling, and delicious meal!"
476,"Located near many different restaurants near the ""college b-town"" area . Small waiting area in front waiting to be seated but quick turn around service (larger tables in rear). I order the shrimp and steak  x convo with rice and the plate was big enough to share. I ordered the sangria which they ran out fruit for but got a double portion for it and it was still very good"
477,First time eating here and eating El Savadorian food. Food was real fresh and so good. Pupusas were so delicious. The bean and sour cream were so creamy.  Loved the plantains.Great service!! Will be going back soon!!
478,"The menu at Platano has plenty of options from light soups to dense plates. Food: I ordered the Ensalada de Aguacate (avocado), which was healthily portioned, vibrant, and aesthetically pleasing. The grilled chicken had a few fried pieces that were too charred for my liking, in other words burnt. I enjoyed the vinaigrette as it countered the creamy avocado, creating a nice balance. The two-piece pupusa combo plate was filling; one pupusa was filled with cheese and the other with pork and beans, the plate came with a few sides. The pupusas were warm on the interior and lightly fried on the outside, however the flavor was lacking and the cheese didn't quite melt enough. They had a microwave textural feel to them and were lacking freshness. We smothered them with crema, but I recommend topping it off with the coleslaw mix to allow the acidity to cut through the richness of the crema. Service: Friendly, but a bit slow. Our food took a while, fortunately we weren't starving.Ambiance: Large and casual restaurant with plenty of seating to accommodate large parties. Price: Most plates ranged from $-$, seafood dishes on the pricier end. Overall: The food was fair in taste and quality could've been better; nice service with a casual ambiance."
479,"I'm from El Salvador and I make the trip from SF to Berkeley to eat here. The food is on point. The decor is nice and the service is efficient. Their ensalada drink could use more fruit in it. Try salpicón, a chilled dish that you don't find everywhere. Pupusas de queso con loroco are yummy!"
480,"Came here last night after some recommendations from my family and loved it!As soon as we walked in the door, a waiter approached us and sat us down immediately. It was pretty crowded too, so this was great customer service. The service throughout our entire time there was great and I have no complaints!The food was amazing. I was born in El Salvador, so I know Salvadoran food when I taste it. Let me say this is true Salvadoran food. I ordered the pupusas with cheese and beans, and they were perfect! Abundance in size, not greasy, and a perfect blend of cheese and beans. I also ordered the horchata and it was good, a little too sweet for my liking but true Salvadoran horchata (tastes a little different than Mexican horchata for those of you unfamiliar.) My fiancée ordered the platillo típico which comes with two pupusas of your choice and rice and beans and he loved it too. My parents ordered a combination of the chicken sandwich, corn tamales, and yucca. I tried a little bit of everything and it satisfied all my cravings!If you are in the area, please do yourself a favor and come to this place. They have such a large variety of dishes to choose from and they depict Salvadoran cuisine to perfection!"
481,"Salvadoran restaurant. ...simple decore. Would rate food 4 stars, service 4 stars.....but bathroom so filthy had to drop overall rating.Dinner :  Pupusas 1 veggie 1 pork & cheese Delious!!! added there homemade slaw...Delicious treat. 5 star.Corn tamales. ..1 steamed , 1fried...Fried Tilapia platter with rice & platanos...yummy food."
482,"I love their pupusas and mangonada!I think they are very reasonably priced, $9.99 lunch menu.They are very accomodating for call-in orders.  I like to call my order in as I drive to the restaurant because I anm limited on lunch time and I like to get in before hteir lunch rush.I love their chicken and cheese pupusa, atol de elote beverage, and mangonada.Their entire menu looks delicious, but every time I visit I order the same thing, haha.I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is seeking delicious food!"
483,"Found Platano thanks to good ol' Yelp, and thank goodness I did because it was absolutely delicious.Came in with some friends for dinner and was immediately sat down. When looking over the menu, I realized that their lunch and dinner options were different instead of being the same and having dinner cost a bit more. This definitely surprised me because I feel like I don't see it often at casual restaurants such as Platano! The only thing that really seemed to be calling my name was #2 on the lunch menu which was two pupusas of your choice with a side avocado salad. I asked if I could order this for my dinner, and they said it was no problem but I would be charged more. I happily obliged :)I decided on the Revuelta (fried pork) and Queso y Loroco (Salvadoran flower). Both pupusas were phenomenal, perfect little pockets of heaven. It was only my second time having the food, but I feel confident in saying that these are some of the best I'll ever have in my life time. The salad was a great addition and balance of greens too, so I'm super thankful they allowed me to get this lunch item during dinner.All in all, delicious and good choice for a meal if you're in berkeley :)"
484,"I wasn't a fan the first time I went here. But after my last visit, I can safely say this is a great place for lunch or dinner if you ever find yourself on University Ave. From the outside, it doesn't seem to be that big of a restaurant. But walking in, there are a good amount of tables, with the restaurant extending to the back -- perfect for groups. The atmosphere is a little dingy, but lively nonetheless with paintings and decor to match the Latin American theme. For lunch, there are multiple options of combos that one can choose from pupusas, plantains, tamales,  side salad, and  sour cream and beans. The combinations are endless, and will satisfy those who want to try a bit of everything. My plate came with two pupusas, chicken tamales, and pickled vegetables. I got the revuelta pupusas which was filled with crispy tender pork, and cheese and also the beef and cheese. Essentially, they were a fried stuffed corn masa tortilla with meat and cheese inside. Alone, they were a bit bland with not a lot of seasoning but with a splash of hot sauce and some pickled vegetables the pupusas tasted much better. The chicken tamales was nothing special, but again with the some hot sauce and pickled vegetables it was really good. My friend got a side of sour cream and beans which i regret not getting, since dipping the pupusas in the sides made it even better!Overall, the prices are reasonable for the quality of food and portions are more than generous. My only complaint would be the service as it took over 30 mins to receive our food when it wasn't even that busy. If you never had El Salvadorian food, its a must try!"
485,"This was my second time coming to Platano, and it definitely didn't disappoint. The first time, I came for dinner, but this time it was for lunch. The vibe was a little different. There were more people during lunchtime, and the whole place felt livelier and brighter. Both my friend and I loved what we got the first time we came here, so we skipped over the lunch specials in favor of their full menu so that we could re-experience the deliciousness we remembered. I ordered the Albondigas, essentially meatballs in some kind of tomato sauce. The dish comes with two sides, so I ordered casamientos (a fried mixture of rice and black beans) and platanos (can't come to Platano without ordering platanos!). I noticed that on their dinner menu, platanos is not a side that is offered, which is a shame because they added a really nice balance to the meal as a whole. The meatballs were delicious - a good texture and perfectly seasoned. As for the sides, I definitely recommend casamientos and platanos. The casamientos are a more interesting version of rice, essentially, and the platanos added a bit of sweetness to the dish, which was perfect for me since I have a massive sweet tooth.My friend and I also ordered a papusa to share, which is essentially a stuffed corn masa tortilla. We chose the chicharron (fried pork) papusa, since it seemed to be The Thing to order here. I don't know if I would order the papusa again, but I'm glad I tried it. The breading was too thick for me and the filling wasn't that exciting. Service was okay, but we had to work a little bit to get their attention for the bill.Still, I'll definitely be coming back here next time!"

I believe there are two levels of the sauce, they usually bring you the milder one but if you ask they have a spicier version. I tend to finish a whole bottle when I go with friends. lol. Overall, a Berkeley gem that not only provides delicious food, but at a decent price."
515,"Got pupusas (the cheese and squash blossom and the cheese and beans) with fried plantains. It was really good! Will definitely be coming back again, and recommend it to anyone interested in an affordable, filling, and delicious meal!"
516,"Located near many different restaurants near the ""college b-town"" area . Small waiting area in front waiting to be seated but quick turn around service (larger tables in rear). I order the shrimp and steak  x convo with rice and the plate was big enough to share. I ordered the sangria which they ran out fruit for but got a double portion for it and it was still very good"
517,First time eating here and eating El Savadorian food. Food was real fresh and so good. Pupusas were so delicious. The bean and sour cream were so creamy.  Loved the plantains.Great service!! Will be going back soon!!
518,"The menu at Platano has plenty of options from light soups to dense plates. Food: I ordered the Ensalada de Aguacate (avocado), which was healthily portioned, vibrant, and aesthetically pleasing. The grilled chicken had a few fried pieces that were too charred for my liking, in other words burnt. I enjoyed the vinaigrette as it countered the creamy avocado, creating a nice balance. The two-piece pupusa combo plate was filling; one pupusa was filled with cheese and the other with pork and beans, the plate came with a few sides. The pupusas were warm on the interior and lightly fried on the outside, however the flavor was lacking and the cheese didn't quite melt enough. They had a microwave textural feel to them and were lacking freshness. We smothered them with crema, but I recommend topping it off with the coleslaw mix to allow the acidity to cut through the richness of the crema. Service: Friendly, but a bit slow. Our food took a while, fortunately we weren't starving.Ambiance: Large and casual restaurant with plenty of seating to accommodate large parties. Price: Most plates ranged from $-$, seafood dishes on the pricier end. Overall: The food was fair in taste and quality could've been better; nice service with a casual ambiance."
519,"I'm from El Salvador and I make the trip from SF to Berkeley to eat here. The food is on point. The decor is nice and the service is efficient. Their ensalada drink could use more fruit in it. Try salpicón, a chilled dish that you don't find everywhere. Pupusas de queso con loroco are yummy!"
520,"Came here last night after some recommendations from my family and loved it!As soon as we walked in the door, a waiter approached us and sat us down immediately. It was pretty crowded too, so this was great customer service. The service throughout our entire time there was great and I have no complaints!The food was amazing. I was born in El Salvador, so I know Salvadoran food when I taste it. Let me say this is true Salvadoran food. I ordered the pupusas with cheese and beans, and they were perfect! Abundance in size, not greasy, and a perfect blend of cheese and beans. I also ordered the horchata and it was good, a little too sweet for my liking but true Salvadoran horchata (tastes a little different than Mexican horchata for those of you unfamiliar.) My fiancée ordered the platillo típico which comes with two pupusas of your choice and rice and beans and he loved it too. My parents ordered a combination of the chicken sandwich, corn tamales, and yucca. I tried a little bit of everything and it satisfied all my cravings!If you are in the area, please do yourself a favor and come to this place. They have such a large variety of dishes to choose from and they depict Salvadoran cuisine to perfection!"
521,"Salvadoran restaurant. ...simple decore. Would rate food 4 stars, service 4 stars.....but bathroom so filthy had to drop overall rating.Dinner :  Pupusas 1 veggie 1 pork & cheese Delious!!! added there homemade slaw...Delicious treat. 5 star.Corn tamales. ..1 steamed , 1fried...Fried Tilapia platter with rice & platanos...yummy food."
522,"I love their pupusas and mangonada!I think they are very reasonably priced, $9.99 lunch menu.They are very accomodating for call-in orders.  I like to call my order in as I drive to the restaurant because I anm limited on lunch time and I like to get in before hteir lunch rush.I love their chicken and cheese pupusa, atol de elote beverage, and mangonada.Their entire menu looks delicious, but every time I visit I order the same thing, haha.I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is seeking delicious food!"
523,"Found Platano thanks to good ol' Yelp, and thank goodness I did because it was absolutely delicious.Came in with some friends for dinner and was immediately sat down. When looking over the menu, I realized that their lunch and dinner options were different instead of being the same and having dinner cost a bit more. This definitely surprised me because I feel like I don't see it often at casual restaurants such as Platano! The only thing that really seemed to be calling my name was #2 on the lunch menu which was two pupusas of your choice with a side avocado salad. I asked if I could order this for my dinner, and they said it was no problem but I would be charged more. I happily obliged :)I decided on the Revuelta (fried pork) and Queso y Loroco (Salvadoran flower). Both pupusas were phenomenal, perfect little pockets of heaven. It was only my second time having the food, but I feel confident in saying that these are some of the best I'll ever have in my life time. The salad was a great addition and balance of greens too, so I'm super thankful they allowed me to get this lunch item during dinner.All in all, delicious and good choice for a meal if you're in berkeley :)"
524,"I wasn't a fan the first time I went here. But after my last visit, I can safely say this is a great place for lunch or dinner if you ever find yourself on University Ave. From the outside, it doesn't seem to be that big of a restaurant. But walking in, there are a good amount of tables, with the restaurant extending to the back -- perfect for groups. The atmosphere is a little dingy, but lively nonetheless with paintings and decor to match the Latin American theme. For lunch, there are multiple options of combos that one can choose from pupusas, plantains, tamales,  side salad, and  sour cream and beans. The combinations are endless, and will satisfy those who want to try a bit of everything. My plate came with two pupusas, chicken tamales, and pickled vegetables. I got the revuelta pupusas which was filled with crispy tender pork, and cheese and also the beef and cheese. Essentially, they were a fried stuffed corn masa tortilla with meat and cheese inside. Alone, they were a bit bland with not a lot of seasoning but with a splash of hot sauce and some pickled vegetables the pupusas tasted much better. The chicken tamales was nothing special, but again with the some hot sauce and pickled vegetables it was really good. My friend got a side of sour cream and beans which i regret not getting, since dipping the pupusas in the sides made it even better!Overall, the prices are reasonable for the quality of food and portions are more than generous. My only complaint would be the service as it took over 30 mins to receive our food when it wasn't even that busy. If you never had El Salvadorian food, its a must try!"
525,"This was my second time coming to Platano, and it definitely didn't disappoint. The first time, I came for dinner, but this time it was for lunch. The vibe was a little different. There were more people during lunchtime, and the whole place felt livelier and brighter. Both my friend and I loved what we got the first time we came here, so we skipped over the lunch specials in favor of their full menu so that we could re-experience the deliciousness we remembered. I ordered the Albondigas, essentially meatballs in some kind of tomato sauce. The dish comes with two sides, so I ordered casamientos (a fried mixture of rice and black beans) and platanos (can't come to Platano without ordering platanos!). I noticed that on their dinner menu, platanos is not a side that is offered, which is a shame because they added a really nice balance to the meal as a whole. The meatballs were delicious - a good texture and perfectly seasoned. As for the sides, I definitely recommend casamientos and platanos. The casamientos are a more interesting version of rice, essentially, and the platanos added a bit of sweetness to the dish, which was perfect for me since I have a massive sweet tooth.My friend and I also ordered a papusa to share, which is essentially a stuffed corn masa tortilla. We chose the chicharron (fried pork) papusa, since it seemed to be The Thing to order here. I don't know if I would order the papusa again, but I'm glad I tried it. The breading was too thick for me and the filling wasn't that exciting. Service was okay, but we had to work a little bit to get their attention for the bill.Still, I'll definitely be coming back here next time!"
526,"VEGAN GLUTEN FREE REVIEW:I love Platano, or rather, their black bean pupusas, curtido, and salsa. The flavors are amazing and they're vegan and gluten free! Platano is my to-go-to place for comforting and delicious food; however, on my last visit there, I saw that they had risen the price for their pupusas. It was $2.50 for a pupusa but now, it's $2.90. For a black bean only pupusa, that's a little steep. I've been to places in San Jose that charge $1.50 per pupusa of the same size, so I feel kind of salty about the price increase. I'll continue to frequent Platano, but I hope they don't raise their prices again; otherwise, it's time to find another pupusaría."
527,"Dependable, nourishing Salvadorian fare served in a cozy, homey space in downtown Berkeley. The homey feel extends to the cooking here, which feels quite authentic. The carne desilada, for example, was a melange of pan-fried crispy shredded beef, eggs, tomato, onions, and bell peppers. Meanwhile, a glass of horchata was refreshing - not too sweet, but not bland - although it was full of ice. Service is courteous here, although as other reviewers have noted, it can take a while for things to come out. Nevertheless, if you want Latin American fare that's not expensive given what you get, not to mention dishes that won't feel like they're busting your gut, Platano is a solid choice."
528,"And we are back again at this selicious place. For those that may want some guidance on other than Pupusas, try the Salpicon with casamiento and sour cream..."
529,"This. Place. Is. Bomb. It's rare that a whole table will agree on one opinion about a restaurant, but no one had any complaints and everyone absolutely loved their food (see reference photo #1.  Total inhalation) Prices are super reasonable (especially for the quality of food you're getting) and portions are quite generous. I ordered the potato stew with re fried beans and a salad and everything was perfect. The stew wasn't as thick as traditional American stews but it packed a punch- seasoned well, full of flavor, super tender and still incredibly filling even without the hearty consistency I'm used to. Beans were awesome (I'm a sucker for re fried beans) and the salad added a nice fresh crunch to my whole meal (the citrusy dressing was a refreshing plus). Everyone at my table ate in silence because we couldn't be bothered with conversation when we were having a tastebud fiesta in our mouths."
530,"VEGAN REVIEW!So apparently, the black bean pupusas are vegan! I have been eating here for years (former Cal student) and I did not know this. I also order the Avocado Salad (no chips, no cheese, dressing on the side) which is also vegan. I imagine the fried plantains are also vegan. Overall, delicious food!"
531,"Pupusaaaaaaas!!!! Everytime I come here the pupusas are a must. I would recommend coming during lunch hours (11-2:30, I think) because they have $10 lunch plate specials which are some combination of 1-2 pupusas, fried plantains, and salad/beans/sour cream. I've tried the chicken, cheese, and zucchini/onion/cheese pupusas and really liked them all. The chicken is probably my favorite of the three. I've also tried the avocado salad and its incredibly filling and tasty."
532,"My favourite papusa and plantanos restaurant in the East Bay. Service, ambiance, quality of food and price met my expectation."
533,"Absolutely delicious and authentic pupusas here! My husband's family is Salvadorean so I know good pupusas when I see them. We got there a little later than our reservation and they were still very accommodating and served us fast. Ordered the Plato Tipico with One Revuelta and One Queso pupusa. They did not disappoint! We also tried their Pastelitos as an appetizer and they were so big, and delicious as well. Highly recommend this Salvadorean restaurant!"
534,"YUMMM! I've never had Salvadorian food until trying this place and now there's no going back for me. Location: It's right at the heart of University St so street parking can be a pain. There's a parking lot behind El Burro but it does get packed. If you're lucky though, you can find some street parking in the areas around university. Service: It looks small on the outside but inside it's quite large. I usually get seated really quickly regardless of how big of a group I come with. However, it can take some time for them to bring you water/refill it and for your order to get to your table once you order. Price: Some dishes can be pretty pricey but the reason to come here is for the pupusas! I think that when I first started coming here they were $2.5 and might have raised to $2.75.

When looking over the menu, I realized that their lunch and dinner options were different instead of being the same and having dinner cost a bit more. This definitely surprised me because I feel like I don't see it often at casual restaurants such as Platano! The only thing that really seemed to be calling my name was #2 on the lunch menu which was two pupusas of your choice with a side avocado salad. I asked if I could order this for my dinner, and they said it was no problem but I would be charged more. I happily obliged :)I decided on the Revuelta (fried pork) and Queso y Loroco (Salvadoran flower). Both pupusas were phenomenal, perfect little pockets of heaven. It was only my second time having the food, but I feel confident in saying that these are some of the best I'll ever have in my life time. The salad was a great addition and balance of greens too, so I'm super thankful they allowed me to get this lunch item during dinner.All in all, delicious and good choice for a meal if you're in berkeley :)"
564,"I wasn't a fan the first time I went here. But after my last visit, I can safely say this is a great place for lunch or dinner if you ever find yourself on University Ave. From the outside, it doesn't seem to be that big of a restaurant. But walking in, there are a good amount of tables, with the restaurant extending to the back -- perfect for groups. The atmosphere is a little dingy, but lively nonetheless with paintings and decor to match the Latin American theme. For lunch, there are multiple options of combos that one can choose from pupusas, plantains, tamales,  side salad, and  sour cream and beans. The combinations are endless, and will satisfy those who want to try a bit of everything. My plate came with two pupusas, chicken tamales, and pickled vegetables. I got the revuelta pupusas which was filled with crispy tender pork, and cheese and also the beef and cheese. Essentially, they were a fried stuffed corn masa tortilla with meat and cheese inside. Alone, they were a bit bland with not a lot of seasoning but with a splash of hot sauce and some pickled vegetables the pupusas tasted much better. The chicken tamales was nothing special, but again with the some hot sauce and pickled vegetables it was really good. My friend got a side of sour cream and beans which i regret not getting, since dipping the pupusas in the sides made it even better!Overall, the prices are reasonable for the quality of food and portions are more than generous. My only complaint would be the service as it took over 30 mins to receive our food when it wasn't even that busy. If you never had El Salvadorian food, its a must try!"
565,"This was my second time coming to Platano, and it definitely didn't disappoint. The first time, I came for dinner, but this time it was for lunch. The vibe was a little different. There were more people during lunchtime, and the whole place felt livelier and brighter. Both my friend and I loved what we got the first time we came here, so we skipped over the lunch specials in favor of their full menu so that we could re-experience the deliciousness we remembered. I ordered the Albondigas, essentially meatballs in some kind of tomato sauce. The dish comes with two sides, so I ordered casamientos (a fried mixture of rice and black beans) and platanos (can't come to Platano without ordering platanos!). I noticed that on their dinner menu, platanos is not a side that is offered, which is a shame because they added a really nice balance to the meal as a whole. The meatballs were delicious - a good texture and perfectly seasoned. As for the sides, I definitely recommend casamientos and platanos. The casamientos are a more interesting version of rice, essentially, and the platanos added a bit of sweetness to the dish, which was perfect for me since I have a massive sweet tooth.My friend and I also ordered a papusa to share, which is essentially a stuffed corn masa tortilla. We chose the chicharron (fried pork) papusa, since it seemed to be The Thing to order here. I don't know if I would order the papusa again, but I'm glad I tried it. The breading was too thick for me and the filling wasn't that exciting. Service was okay, but we had to work a little bit to get their attention for the bill.Still, I'll definitely be coming back here next time!"
566,"VEGAN GLUTEN FREE REVIEW:I love Platano, or rather, their black bean pupusas, curtido, and salsa. The flavors are amazing and they're vegan and gluten free! Platano is my to-go-to place for comforting and delicious food; however, on my last visit there, I saw that they had risen the price for their pupusas. It was $2.50 for a pupusa but now, it's $2.90. For a black bean only pupusa, that's a little steep. I've been to places in San Jose that charge $1.50 per pupusa of the same size, so I feel kind of salty about the price increase. I'll continue to frequent Platano, but I hope they don't raise their prices again; otherwise, it's time to find another pupusaría."
567,"Dependable, nourishing Salvadorian fare served in a cozy, homey space in downtown Berkeley. The homey feel extends to the cooking here, which feels quite authentic. The carne desilada, for example, was a melange of pan-fried crispy shredded beef, eggs, tomato, onions, and bell peppers. Meanwhile, a glass of horchata was refreshing - not too sweet, but not bland - although it was full of ice. Service is courteous here, although as other reviewers have noted, it can take a while for things to come out. Nevertheless, if you want Latin American fare that's not expensive given what you get, not to mention dishes that won't feel like they're busting your gut, Platano is a solid choice."
568,"And we are back again at this selicious place. For those that may want some guidance on other than Pupusas, try the Salpicon with casamiento and sour cream..."
569,"This. Place. Is. Bomb. It's rare that a whole table will agree on one opinion about a restaurant, but no one had any complaints and everyone absolutely loved their food (see reference photo #1.  Total inhalation) Prices are super reasonable (especially for the quality of food you're getting) and portions are quite generous. I ordered the potato stew with re fried beans and a salad and everything was perfect. The stew wasn't as thick as traditional American stews but it packed a punch- seasoned well, full of flavor, super tender and still incredibly filling even without the hearty consistency I'm used to. Beans were awesome (I'm a sucker for re fried beans) and the salad added a nice fresh crunch to my whole meal (the citrusy dressing was a refreshing plus). Everyone at my table ate in silence because we couldn't be bothered with conversation when we were having a tastebud fiesta in our mouths."
570,"VEGAN REVIEW!So apparently, the black bean pupusas are vegan! I have been eating here for years (former Cal student) and I did not know this. I also order the Avocado Salad (no chips, no cheese, dressing on the side) which is also vegan. I imagine the fried plantains are also vegan. Overall, delicious food!"
571,"Pupusaaaaaaas!!!! Everytime I come here the pupusas are a must. I would recommend coming during lunch hours (11-2:30, I think) because they have $10 lunch plate specials which are some combination of 1-2 pupusas, fried plantains, and salad/beans/sour cream. I've tried the chicken, cheese, and zucchini/onion/cheese pupusas and really liked them all. The chicken is probably my favorite of the three. I've also tried the avocado salad and its incredibly filling and tasty."
572,"My favourite papusa and plantanos restaurant in the East Bay. Service, ambiance, quality of food and price met my expectation."
573,"Absolutely delicious and authentic pupusas here! My husband's family is Salvadorean so I know good pupusas when I see them. We got there a little later than our reservation and they were still very accommodating and served us fast. Ordered the Plato Tipico with One Revuelta and One Queso pupusa. They did not disappoint! We also tried their Pastelitos as an appetizer and they were so big, and delicious as well. Highly recommend this Salvadorean restaurant!"
574,"YUMMM! I've never had Salvadorian food until trying this place and now there's no going back for me. Location: It's right at the heart of University St so street parking can be a pain. There's a parking lot behind El Burro but it does get packed. If you're lucky though, you can find some street parking in the areas around university. Service: It looks small on the outside but inside it's quite large. I usually get seated really quickly regardless of how big of a group I come with. However, it can take some time for them to bring you water/refill it and for your order to get to your table once you order. Price: Some dishes can be pretty pricey but the reason to come here is for the pupusas! I think that when I first started coming here they were $2.5 and might have raised to $2.75. Food: My go tos are the ruvuelta and bean and cheese. I usually order only 2 since they're so filling! I always pair them with plantains too. YUMMM. With your meal they bring you some sauce and slaw. I believe there are two levels of the sauce, they usually bring you the milder one but if you ask they have a spicier version. I tend to finish a whole bottle when I go with friends. lol. Overall, a Berkeley gem that not only provides delicious food, but at a decent price."
575,"Got pupusas (the cheese and squash blossom and the cheese and beans) with fried plantains. It was really good! Will definitely be coming back again, and recommend it to anyone interested in an affordable, filling, and delicious meal!"
576,"Located near many different restaurants near the ""college b-town"" area . Small waiting area in front waiting to be seated but quick turn around service (larger tables in rear). I order the shrimp and steak  x convo with rice and the plate was big enough to share. I ordered the sangria which they ran out fruit for but got a double portion for it and it was still very good"
577,First time eating here and eating El Savadorian food. Food was real fresh and so good. Pupusas were so delicious. The bean and sour cream were so creamy.  Loved the plantains.Great service!! Will be going back soon!!
578,"The menu at Platano has plenty of options from light soups to dense plates. Food: I ordered the Ensalada de Aguacate (avocado), which was healthily portioned, vibrant, and aesthetically pleasing. The grilled chicken had a few fried pieces that were too charred for my liking, in other words burnt. I enjoyed the vinaigrette as it countered the creamy avocado, creating a nice balance. The two-piece pupusa combo plate was filling; one pupusa was filled with cheese and the other with pork and beans, the plate came with a few sides. The pupusas were warm on the interior and lightly fried on the outside, however the flavor was lacking and the cheese didn't quite melt enough. They had a microwave textural feel to them and were lacking freshness. We smothered them with crema, but I recommend topping it off with the coleslaw mix to allow the acidity to cut through the richness of the crema. Service: Friendly, but a bit slow. Our food took a while, fortunately we weren't starving.Ambiance: Large and casual restaurant with plenty of seating to accommodate large parties. Price: Most plates ranged from $-$, seafood dishes on the pricier end. Overall: The food was fair in taste and quality could've been better; nice service with a casual ambiance."
579,"I'm from El Salvador and I make the trip from SF to Berkeley to eat here. The food is on point. The decor is nice and the service is efficient. Their ensalada drink could use more fruit in it. Try salpicón, a chilled dish that you don't find everywhere. Pupusas de queso con loroco are yummy!"
580,"Came here last night after some recommendations from my family and loved it!As soon as we walked in the door, a waiter approached us and sat us down immediately. It was pretty crowded too, so this was great customer service. The service throughout our entire time there was great and I have no complaints!The food was amazing. I was born in El Salvador, so I know Salvadoran food when I taste it. Let me say this is true Salvadoran food. I ordered the pupusas with cheese and beans, and they were perfect! Abundance in size, not greasy, and a perfect blend of cheese and beans. I also ordered the horchata and it was good, a little too sweet for my liking but true Salvadoran horchata (tastes a little different than Mexican horchata for those of you unfamiliar.) My fiancée ordered the platillo típico which comes with two pupusas of your choice and rice and beans and he loved it too. My parents ordered a combination of the chicken sandwich, corn tamales, and yucca. I tried a little bit of everything and it satisfied all my cravings!If you are in the area, please do yourself a favor and come to this place. They have such a large variety of dishes to choose from and they depict Salvadoran cuisine to perfection!"
581,"Salvadoran restaurant. ...simple decore. Would rate food 4 stars, service 4 stars.....but bathroom so filthy had to drop overall rating.Dinner :  Pupusas 1 veggie 1 pork & cheese Delious!!! added there homemade slaw...Delicious treat. 5 star.Corn tamales. ..1 steamed , 1fried...Fried Tilapia platter with rice & platanos...yummy food."

Platano is my to-go-to place for comforting and delicious food; however, on my last visit there, I saw that they had risen the price for their pupusas. It was $2.50 for a pupusa but now, it's $2.90. For a black bean only pupusa, that's a little steep. I've been to places in San Jose that charge $1.50 per pupusa of the same size, so I feel kind of salty about the price increase. I'll continue to frequent Platano, but I hope they don't raise their prices again; otherwise, it's time to find another pupusaría."
607,"Dependable, nourishing Salvadorian fare served in a cozy, homey space in downtown Berkeley. The homey feel extends to the cooking here, which feels quite authentic. The carne desilada, for example, was a melange of pan-fried crispy shredded beef, eggs, tomato, onions, and bell peppers. Meanwhile, a glass of horchata was refreshing - not too sweet, but not bland - although it was full of ice. Service is courteous here, although as other reviewers have noted, it can take a while for things to come out. Nevertheless, if you want Latin American fare that's not expensive given what you get, not to mention dishes that won't feel like they're busting your gut, Platano is a solid choice."
608,"And we are back again at this selicious place. For those that may want some guidance on other than Pupusas, try the Salpicon with casamiento and sour cream..."
609,"This. Place. Is. Bomb. It's rare that a whole table will agree on one opinion about a restaurant, but no one had any complaints and everyone absolutely loved their food (see reference photo #1.  Total inhalation) Prices are super reasonable (especially for the quality of food you're getting) and portions are quite generous. I ordered the potato stew with re fried beans and a salad and everything was perfect. The stew wasn't as thick as traditional American stews but it packed a punch- seasoned well, full of flavor, super tender and still incredibly filling even without the hearty consistency I'm used to. Beans were awesome (I'm a sucker for re fried beans) and the salad added a nice fresh crunch to my whole meal (the citrusy dressing was a refreshing plus). Everyone at my table ate in silence because we couldn't be bothered with conversation when we were having a tastebud fiesta in our mouths."
610,"VEGAN REVIEW!So apparently, the black bean pupusas are vegan! I have been eating here for years (former Cal student) and I did not know this. I also order the Avocado Salad (no chips, no cheese, dressing on the side) which is also vegan. I imagine the fried plantains are also vegan. Overall, delicious food!"
611,"Pupusaaaaaaas!!!! Everytime I come here the pupusas are a must. I would recommend coming during lunch hours (11-2:30, I think) because they have $10 lunch plate specials which are some combination of 1-2 pupusas, fried plantains, and salad/beans/sour cream. I've tried the chicken, cheese, and zucchini/onion/cheese pupusas and really liked them all. The chicken is probably my favorite of the three. I've also tried the avocado salad and its incredibly filling and tasty."
612,"My favourite papusa and plantanos restaurant in the East Bay. Service, ambiance, quality of food and price met my expectation."
613,"Absolutely delicious and authentic pupusas here! My husband's family is Salvadorean so I know good pupusas when I see them. We got there a little later than our reservation and they were still very accommodating and served us fast. Ordered the Plato Tipico with One Revuelta and One Queso pupusa. They did not disappoint! We also tried their Pastelitos as an appetizer and they were so big, and delicious as well. Highly recommend this Salvadorean restaurant!"
614,"YUMMM! I've never had Salvadorian food until trying this place and now there's no going back for me. Location: It's right at the heart of University St so street parking can be a pain. There's a parking lot behind El Burro but it does get packed. If you're lucky though, you can find some street parking in the areas around university. Service: It looks small on the outside but inside it's quite large. I usually get seated really quickly regardless of how big of a group I come with. However, it can take some time for them to bring you water/refill it and for your order to get to your table once you order. Price: Some dishes can be pretty pricey but the reason to come here is for the pupusas! I think that when I first started coming here they were $2.5 and might have raised to $2.75. Food: My go tos are the ruvuelta and bean and cheese. I usually order only 2 since they're so filling! I always pair them with plantains too. YUMMM. With your meal they bring you some sauce and slaw. I believe there are two levels of the sauce, they usually bring you the milder one but if you ask they have a spicier version. I tend to finish a whole bottle when I go with friends. lol. Overall, a Berkeley gem that not only provides delicious food, but at a decent price."
615,"Got pupusas (the cheese and squash blossom and the cheese and beans) with fried plantains. It was really good! Will definitely be coming back again, and recommend it to anyone interested in an affordable, filling, and delicious meal!"
616,"Located near many different restaurants near the ""college b-town"" area . Small waiting area in front waiting to be seated but quick turn around service (larger tables in rear). I order the shrimp and steak  x convo with rice and the plate was big enough to share. I ordered the sangria which they ran out fruit for but got a double portion for it and it was still very good"
617,First time eating here and eating El Savadorian food. Food was real fresh and so good. Pupusas were so delicious. The bean and sour cream were so creamy.  Loved the plantains.Great service!! Will be going back soon!!
618,"The menu at Platano has plenty of options from light soups to dense plates. Food: I ordered the Ensalada de Aguacate (avocado), which was healthily portioned, vibrant, and aesthetically pleasing. The grilled chicken had a few fried pieces that were too charred for my liking, in other words burnt. I enjoyed the vinaigrette as it countered the creamy avocado, creating a nice balance. The two-piece pupusa combo plate was filling; one pupusa was filled with cheese and the other with pork and beans, the plate came with a few sides. The pupusas were warm on the interior and lightly fried on the outside, however the flavor was lacking and the cheese didn't quite melt enough. They had a microwave textural feel to them and were lacking freshness. We smothered them with crema, but I recommend topping it off with the coleslaw mix to allow the acidity to cut through the richness of the crema. Service: Friendly, but a bit slow. Our food took a while, fortunately we weren't starving.Ambiance: Large and casual restaurant with plenty of seating to accommodate large parties. Price: Most plates ranged from $-$, seafood dishes on the pricier end. Overall: The food was fair in taste and quality could've been better; nice service with a casual ambiance."
619,"I'm from El Salvador and I make the trip from SF to Berkeley to eat here. The food is on point. The decor is nice and the service is efficient. Their ensalada drink could use more fruit in it. Try salpicón, a chilled dish that you don't find everywhere. Pupusas de queso con loroco are yummy!"
620,"Came here last night after some recommendations from my family and loved it!As soon as we walked in the door, a waiter approached us and sat us down immediately. It was pretty crowded too, so this was great customer service. The service throughout our entire time there was great and I have no complaints!The food was amazing. I was born in El Salvador, so I know Salvadoran food when I taste it. Let me say this is true Salvadoran food. I ordered the pupusas with cheese and beans, and they were perfect! Abundance in size, not greasy, and a perfect blend of cheese and beans. I also ordered the horchata and it was good, a little too sweet for my liking but true Salvadoran horchata (tastes a little different than Mexican horchata for those of you unfamiliar.) My fiancée ordered the platillo típico which comes with two pupusas of your choice and rice and beans and he loved it too. My parents ordered a combination of the chicken sandwich, corn tamales, and yucca. I tried a little bit of everything and it satisfied all my cravings!If you are in the area, please do yourself a favor and come to this place. They have such a large variety of dishes to choose from and they depict Salvadoran cuisine to perfection!"
621,"Salvadoran restaurant. ...simple decore. Would rate food 4 stars, service 4 stars.....but bathroom so filthy had to drop overall rating.Dinner :  Pupusas 1 veggie 1 pork & cheese Delious!!! added there homemade slaw...Delicious treat. 5 star.Corn tamales. ..1 steamed , 1fried...Fried Tilapia platter with rice & platanos...yummy food."
622,"I love their pupusas and mangonada!I think they are very reasonably priced, $9.99 lunch menu.They are very accomodating for call-in orders.  I like to call my order in as I drive to the restaurant because I anm limited on lunch time and I like to get in before hteir lunch rush.I love their chicken and cheese pupusa, atol de elote beverage, and mangonada.Their entire menu looks delicious, but every time I visit I order the same thing, haha.I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is seeking delicious food!"
623,"Found Platano thanks to good ol' Yelp, and thank goodness I did because it was absolutely delicious.Came in with some friends for dinner and was immediately sat down. When looking over the menu, I realized that their lunch and dinner options were different instead of being the same and having dinner cost a bit more. This definitely surprised me because I feel like I don't see it often at casual restaurants such as Platano! The only thing that really seemed to be calling my name was #2 on the lunch menu which was two pupusas of your choice with a side avocado salad. I asked if I could order this for my dinner, and they said it was no problem but I would be charged more. I happily obliged :)I decided on the Revuelta (fried pork) and Queso y Loroco (Salvadoran flower). Both pupusas were phenomenal, perfect little pockets of heaven. It was only my second time having the food, but I feel confident in saying that these are some of the best I'll ever have in my life time. The salad was a great addition and balance of greens too, so I'm super thankful they allowed me to get this lunch item during dinner.All in all, delicious and good choice for a meal if you're in berkeley :)"
624,"I wasn't a fan the first time I went here. But after my last visit, I can safely say this is a great place for lunch or dinner if you ever find yourself on University Ave. From the outside, it doesn't seem to be that big of a restaurant. But walking in, there are a good amount of tables, with the restaurant extending to the back -- perfect for groups. The atmosphere is a little dingy, but lively nonetheless with paintings and decor to match the Latin American theme. For lunch, there are multiple options of combos that one can choose from pupusas, plantains, tamales,  side salad, and  sour cream and beans. The combinations are endless, and will satisfy those who want to try a bit of everything. My plate came with two pupusas, chicken tamales, and pickled vegetables. I got the revuelta pupusas which was filled with crispy tender pork, and cheese and also the beef and cheese. Essentially, they were a fried stuffed corn masa tortilla with meat and cheese inside. Alone, they were a bit bland with not a lot of seasoning but with a splash of hot sauce and some pickled vegetables the pupusas tasted much better. The chicken tamales was nothing special, but again with the some hot sauce and pickled vegetables it was really good. My friend got a side of sour cream and beans which i regret not getting, since dipping the pupusas in the sides made it even better!Overall, the prices are reasonable for the quality of food and portions are more than generous. My only complaint would be the service as it took over 30 mins to receive our food when it wasn't even that busy. If you never had El Salvadorian food, its a must try!"
625,"This was my second time coming to Platano, and it definitely didn't disappoint. The first time, I came for dinner, but this time it was for lunch. The vibe was a little different. There were more people during lunchtime, and the whole place felt livelier and brighter. Both my friend and I loved what we got the first time we came here, so we skipped over the lunch specials in favor of their full menu so that we could re-experience the deliciousness we remembered. I ordered the Albondigas, essentially meatballs in some kind of tomato sauce. The dish comes with two sides, so I ordered casamientos (a fried mixture of rice and black beans) and platanos (can't come to Platano without ordering platanos!). I noticed that on their dinner menu, platanos is not a side that is offered, which is a shame because they added a really nice balance to the meal as a whole. The meatballs were delicious - a good texture and perfectly seasoned. As for the sides, I definitely recommend casamientos and platanos. The casamientos are a more interesting version of rice, essentially, and the platanos added a bit of sweetness to the dish, which was perfect for me since I have a massive sweet tooth.My friend and I also ordered a papusa to share, which is essentially a stuffed corn masa tortilla. We chose the chicharron (fried pork) papusa, since it seemed to be The Thing to order here. I don't know if I would order the papusa again, but I'm glad I tried it. The breading was too thick for me and the filling wasn't that exciting. Service was okay, but we had to work a little bit to get their attention for the bill.Still, I'll definitely be coming back here next time!"

I believe there are two levels of the sauce, they usually bring you the milder one but if you ask they have a spicier version. I tend to finish a whole bottle when I go with friends. lol. Overall, a Berkeley gem that not only provides delicious food, but at a decent price."
655,"Got pupusas (the cheese and squash blossom and the cheese and beans) with fried plantains. It was really good! Will definitely be coming back again, and recommend it to anyone interested in an affordable, filling, and delicious meal!"
656,"Located near many different restaurants near the ""college b-town"" area . Small waiting area in front waiting to be seated but quick turn around service (larger tables in rear). I order the shrimp and steak  x convo with rice and the plate was big enough to share. I ordered the sangria which they ran out fruit for but got a double portion for it and it was still very good"
657,First time eating here and eating El Savadorian food. Food was real fresh and so good. Pupusas were so delicious. The bean and sour cream were so creamy.  Loved the plantains.Great service!! Will be going back soon!!
658,"The menu at Platano has plenty of options from light soups to dense plates. Food: I ordered the Ensalada de Aguacate (avocado), which was healthily portioned, vibrant, and aesthetically pleasing. The grilled chicken had a few fried pieces that were too charred for my liking, in other words burnt. I enjoyed the vinaigrette as it countered the creamy avocado, creating a nice balance. The two-piece pupusa combo plate was filling; one pupusa was filled with cheese and the other with pork and beans, the plate came with a few sides. The pupusas were warm on the interior and lightly fried on the outside, however the flavor was lacking and the cheese didn't quite melt enough. They had a microwave textural feel to them and were lacking freshness. We smothered them with crema, but I recommend topping it off with the coleslaw mix to allow the acidity to cut through the richness of the crema. Service: Friendly, but a bit slow. Our food took a while, fortunately we weren't starving.Ambiance: Large and casual restaurant with plenty of seating to accommodate large parties. Price: Most plates ranged from $-$, seafood dishes on the pricier end. Overall: The food was fair in taste and quality could've been better; nice service with a casual ambiance."
659,"I'm from El Salvador and I make the trip from SF to Berkeley to eat here. The food is on point. The decor is nice and the service is efficient. Their ensalada drink could use more fruit in it. Try salpicón, a chilled dish that you don't find everywhere. Pupusas de queso con loroco are yummy!"
660,"Came here last night after some recommendations from my family and loved it!As soon as we walked in the door, a waiter approached us and sat us down immediately. It was pretty crowded too, so this was great customer service. The service throughout our entire time there was great and I have no complaints!The food was amazing. I was born in El Salvador, so I know Salvadoran food when I taste it. Let me say this is true Salvadoran food. I ordered the pupusas with cheese and beans, and they were perfect! Abundance in size, not greasy, and a perfect blend of cheese and beans. I also ordered the horchata and it was good, a little too sweet for my liking but true Salvadoran horchata (tastes a little different than Mexican horchata for those of you unfamiliar.) My fiancée ordered the platillo típico which comes with two pupusas of your choice and rice and beans and he loved it too. My parents ordered a combination of the chicken sandwich, corn tamales, and yucca. I tried a little bit of everything and it satisfied all my cravings!If you are in the area, please do yourself a favor and come to this place. They have such a large variety of dishes to choose from and they depict Salvadoran cuisine to perfection!"
661,"Salvadoran restaurant. ...simple decore. Would rate food 4 stars, service 4 stars.....but bathroom so filthy had to drop overall rating.Dinner :  Pupusas 1 veggie 1 pork & cheese Delious!!! added there homemade slaw...Delicious treat. 5 star.Corn tamales. ..1 steamed , 1fried...Fried Tilapia platter with rice & platanos...yummy food."
662,"I love their pupusas and mangonada!I think they are very reasonably priced, $9.99 lunch menu.They are very accomodating for call-in orders.  I like to call my order in as I drive to the restaurant because I anm limited on lunch time and I like to get in before hteir lunch rush.I love their chicken and cheese pupusa, atol de elote beverage, and mangonada.Their entire menu looks delicious, but every time I visit I order the same thing, haha.I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is seeking delicious food!"
663,"Found Platano thanks to good ol' Yelp, and thank goodness I did because it was absolutely delicious.Came in with some friends for dinner and was immediately sat down. When looking over the menu, I realized that their lunch and dinner options were different instead of being the same and having dinner cost a bit more. This definitely surprised me because I feel like I don't see it often at casual restaurants such as Platano! The only thing that really seemed to be calling my name was #2 on the lunch menu which was two pupusas of your choice with a side avocado salad. I asked if I could order this for my dinner, and they said it was no problem but I would be charged more. I happily obliged :)I decided on the Revuelta (fried pork) and Queso y Loroco (Salvadoran flower). Both pupusas were phenomenal, perfect little pockets of heaven. It was only my second time having the food, but I feel confident in saying that these are some of the best I'll ever have in my life time. The salad was a great addition and balance of greens too, so I'm super thankful they allowed me to get this lunch item during dinner.All in all, delicious and good choice for a meal if you're in berkeley :)"
664,"I wasn't a fan the first time I went here. But after my last visit, I can safely say this is a great place for lunch or dinner if you ever find yourself on University Ave. From the outside, it doesn't seem to be that big of a restaurant. But walking in, there are a good amount of tables, with the restaurant extending to the back -- perfect for groups. The atmosphere is a little dingy, but lively nonetheless with paintings and decor to match the Latin American theme. For lunch, there are multiple options of combos that one can choose from pupusas, plantains, tamales,  side salad, and  sour cream and beans. The combinations are endless, and will satisfy those who want to try a bit of everything. My plate came with two pupusas, chicken tamales, and pickled vegetables. I got the revuelta pupusas which was filled with crispy tender pork, and cheese and also the beef and cheese. Essentially, they were a fried stuffed corn masa tortilla with meat and cheese inside. Alone, they were a bit bland with not a lot of seasoning but with a splash of hot sauce and some pickled vegetables the pupusas tasted much better. The chicken tamales was nothing special, but again with the some hot sauce and pickled vegetables it was really good. My friend got a side of sour cream and beans which i regret not getting, since dipping the pupusas in the sides made it even better!Overall, the prices are reasonable for the quality of food and portions are more than generous. My only complaint would be the service as it took over 30 mins to receive our food when it wasn't even that busy. If you never had El Salvadorian food, its a must try!"
665,"This was my second time coming to Platano, and it definitely didn't disappoint. The first time, I came for dinner, but this time it was for lunch. The vibe was a little different. There were more people during lunchtime, and the whole place felt livelier and brighter. Both my friend and I loved what we got the first time we came here, so we skipped over the lunch specials in favor of their full menu so that we could re-experience the deliciousness we remembered. I ordered the Albondigas, essentially meatballs in some kind of tomato sauce. The dish comes with two sides, so I ordered casamientos (a fried mixture of rice and black beans) and platanos (can't come to Platano without ordering platanos!). I noticed that on their dinner menu, platanos is not a side that is offered, which is a shame because they added a really nice balance to the meal as a whole. The meatballs were delicious - a good texture and perfectly seasoned. As for the sides, I definitely recommend casamientos and platanos. The casamientos are a more interesting version of rice, essentially, and the platanos added a bit of sweetness to the dish, which was perfect for me since I have a massive sweet tooth.My friend and I also ordered a papusa to share, which is essentially a stuffed corn masa tortilla. We chose the chicharron (fried pork) papusa, since it seemed to be The Thing to order here. I don't know if I would order the papusa again, but I'm glad I tried it. The breading was too thick for me and the filling wasn't that exciting. Service was okay, but we had to work a little bit to get their attention for the bill.Still, I'll definitely be coming back here next time!"
666,"VEGAN GLUTEN FREE REVIEW:I love Platano, or rather, their black bean pupusas, curtido, and salsa. The flavors are amazing and they're vegan and gluten free! Platano is my to-go-to place for comforting and delicious food; however, on my last visit there, I saw that they had risen the price for their pupusas. It was $2.50 for a pupusa but now, it's $2.90. For a black bean only pupusa, that's a little steep. I've been to places in San Jose that charge $1.50 per pupusa of the same size, so I feel kind of salty about the price increase. I'll continue to frequent Platano, but I hope they don't raise their prices again; otherwise, it's time to find another pupusaría."
667,"Dependable, nourishing Salvadorian fare served in a cozy, homey space in downtown Berkeley. The homey feel extends to the cooking here, which feels quite authentic. The carne desilada, for example, was a melange of pan-fried crispy shredded beef, eggs, tomato, onions, and bell peppers. Meanwhile, a glass of horchata was refreshing - not too sweet, but not bland - although it was full of ice. Service is courteous here, although as other reviewers have noted, it can take a while for things to come out. Nevertheless, if you want Latin American fare that's not expensive given what you get, not to mention dishes that won't feel like they're busting your gut, Platano is a solid choice."
668,"And we are back again at this selicious place. For those that may want some guidance on other than Pupusas, try the Salpicon with casamiento and sour cream..."
669,"This. Place. Is. Bomb. It's rare that a whole table will agree on one opinion about a restaurant, but no one had any complaints and everyone absolutely loved their food (see reference photo #1.  Total inhalation) Prices are super reasonable (especially for the quality of food you're getting) and portions are quite generous. I ordered the potato stew with re fried beans and a salad and everything was perfect. The stew wasn't as thick as traditional American stews but it packed a punch- seasoned well, full of flavor, super tender and still incredibly filling even without the hearty consistency I'm used to. Beans were awesome (I'm a sucker for re fried beans) and the salad added a nice fresh crunch to my whole meal (the citrusy dressing was a refreshing plus). Everyone at my table ate in silence because we couldn't be bothered with conversation when we were having a tastebud fiesta in our mouths."
670,"VEGAN REVIEW!So apparently, the black bean pupusas are vegan! I have been eating here for years (former Cal student) and I did not know this. I also order the Avocado Salad (no chips, no cheese, dressing on the side) which is also vegan. I imagine the fried plantains are also vegan. Overall, delicious food!"
671,"Pupusaaaaaaas!!!! Everytime I come here the pupusas are a must. I would recommend coming during lunch hours (11-2:30, I think) because they have $10 lunch plate specials which are some combination of 1-2 pupusas, fried plantains, and salad/beans/sour cream. I've tried the chicken, cheese, and zucchini/onion/cheese pupusas and really liked them all. The chicken is probably my favorite of the three. I've also tried the avocado salad and its incredibly filling and tasty."
672,"My favourite papusa and plantanos restaurant in the East Bay. Service, ambiance, quality of food and price met my expectation."
673,"Absolutely delicious and authentic pupusas here! My husband's family is Salvadorean so I know good pupusas when I see them. We got there a little later than our reservation and they were still very accommodating and served us fast. Ordered the Plato Tipico with One Revuelta and One Queso pupusa. They did not disappoint! We also tried their Pastelitos as an appetizer and they were so big, and delicious as well. Highly recommend this Salvadorean restaurant!"
674,"YUMMM! I've never had Salvadorian food until trying this place and now there's no going back for me. Location: It's right at the heart of University St so street parking can be a pain. There's a parking lot behind El Burro but it does get packed. If you're lucky though, you can find some street parking in the areas around university. Service: It looks small on the outside but inside it's quite large. I usually get seated really quickly regardless of how big of a group I come with. However, it can take some time for them to bring you water/refill it and for your order to get to your table once you order. Price: Some dishes can be pretty pricey but the reason to come here is for the pupusas! I think that when I first started coming here they were $2.5 and might have raised to $2.75.

When looking over the menu, I realized that their lunch and dinner options were different instead of being the same and having dinner cost a bit more. This definitely surprised me because I feel like I don't see it often at casual restaurants such as Platano! The only thing that really seemed to be calling my name was #2 on the lunch menu which was two pupusas of your choice with a side avocado salad. I asked if I could order this for my dinner, and they said it was no problem but I would be charged more. I happily obliged :)I decided on the Revuelta (fried pork) and Queso y Loroco (Salvadoran flower). Both pupusas were phenomenal, perfect little pockets of heaven. It was only my second time having the food, but I feel confident in saying that these are some of the best I'll ever have in my life time. The salad was a great addition and balance of greens too, so I'm super thankful they allowed me to get this lunch item during dinner.All in all, delicious and good choice for a meal if you're in berkeley :)"
704,"I wasn't a fan the first time I went here. But after my last visit, I can safely say this is a great place for lunch or dinner if you ever find yourself on University Ave. From the outside, it doesn't seem to be that big of a restaurant. But walking in, there are a good amount of tables, with the restaurant extending to the back -- perfect for groups. The atmosphere is a little dingy, but lively nonetheless with paintings and decor to match the Latin American theme. For lunch, there are multiple options of combos that one can choose from pupusas, plantains, tamales,  side salad, and  sour cream and beans. The combinations are endless, and will satisfy those who want to try a bit of everything. My plate came with two pupusas, chicken tamales, and pickled vegetables. I got the revuelta pupusas which was filled with crispy tender pork, and cheese and also the beef and cheese. Essentially, they were a fried stuffed corn masa tortilla with meat and cheese inside. Alone, they were a bit bland with not a lot of seasoning but with a splash of hot sauce and some pickled vegetables the pupusas tasted much better. The chicken tamales was nothing special, but again with the some hot sauce and pickled vegetables it was really good. My friend got a side of sour cream and beans which i regret not getting, since dipping the pupusas in the sides made it even better!Overall, the prices are reasonable for the quality of food and portions are more than generous. My only complaint would be the service as it took over 30 mins to receive our food when it wasn't even that busy. If you never had El Salvadorian food, its a must try!"
705,"This was my second time coming to Platano, and it definitely didn't disappoint. The first time, I came for dinner, but this time it was for lunch. The vibe was a little different. There were more people during lunchtime, and the whole place felt livelier and brighter. Both my friend and I loved what we got the first time we came here, so we skipped over the lunch specials in favor of their full menu so that we could re-experience the deliciousness we remembered. I ordered the Albondigas, essentially meatballs in some kind of tomato sauce. The dish comes with two sides, so I ordered casamientos (a fried mixture of rice and black beans) and platanos (can't come to Platano without ordering platanos!). I noticed that on their dinner menu, platanos is not a side that is offered, which is a shame because they added a really nice balance to the meal as a whole. The meatballs were delicious - a good texture and perfectly seasoned. As for the sides, I definitely recommend casamientos and platanos. The casamientos are a more interesting version of rice, essentially, and the platanos added a bit of sweetness to the dish, which was perfect for me since I have a massive sweet tooth.My friend and I also ordered a papusa to share, which is essentially a stuffed corn masa tortilla. We chose the chicharron (fried pork) papusa, since it seemed to be The Thing to order here. I don't know if I would order the papusa again, but I'm glad I tried it. The breading was too thick for me and the filling wasn't that exciting. Service was okay, but we had to work a little bit to get their attention for the bill.Still, I'll definitely be coming back here next time!"
706,"VEGAN GLUTEN FREE REVIEW:I love Platano, or rather, their black bean pupusas, curtido, and salsa. The flavors are amazing and they're vegan and gluten free! Platano is my to-go-to place for comforting and delicious food; however, on my last visit there, I saw that they had risen the price for their pupusas. It was $2.50 for a pupusa but now, it's $2.90. For a black bean only pupusa, that's a little steep. I've been to places in San Jose that charge $1.50 per pupusa of the same size, so I feel kind of salty about the price increase. I'll continue to frequent Platano, but I hope they don't raise their prices again; otherwise, it's time to find another pupusaría."
707,"Dependable, nourishing Salvadorian fare served in a cozy, homey space in downtown Berkeley. The homey feel extends to the cooking here, which feels quite authentic. The carne desilada, for example, was a melange of pan-fried crispy shredded beef, eggs, tomato, onions, and bell peppers. Meanwhile, a glass of horchata was refreshing - not too sweet, but not bland - although it was full of ice. Service is courteous here, although as other reviewers have noted, it can take a while for things to come out. Nevertheless, if you want Latin American fare that's not expensive given what you get, not to mention dishes that won't feel like they're busting your gut, Platano is a solid choice."
708,"And we are back again at this selicious place. For those that may want some guidance on other than Pupusas, try the Salpicon with casamiento and sour cream..."
709,"This. Place. Is. Bomb. It's rare that a whole table will agree on one opinion about a restaurant, but no one had any complaints and everyone absolutely loved their food (see reference photo #1.  Total inhalation) Prices are super reasonable (especially for the quality of food you're getting) and portions are quite generous. I ordered the potato stew with re fried beans and a salad and everything was perfect. The stew wasn't as thick as traditional American stews but it packed a punch- seasoned well, full of flavor, super tender and still incredibly filling even without the hearty consistency I'm used to. Beans were awesome (I'm a sucker for re fried beans) and the salad added a nice fresh crunch to my whole meal (the citrusy dressing was a refreshing plus). Everyone at my table ate in silence because we couldn't be bothered with conversation when we were having a tastebud fiesta in our mouths."
710,"VEGAN REVIEW!So apparently, the black bean pupusas are vegan! I have been eating here for years (former Cal student) and I did not know this. I also order the Avocado Salad (no chips, no cheese, dressing on the side) which is also vegan. I imagine the fried plantains are also vegan. Overall, delicious food!"
711,"Pupusaaaaaaas!!!! Everytime I come here the pupusas are a must. I would recommend coming during lunch hours (11-2:30, I think) because they have $10 lunch plate specials which are some combination of 1-2 pupusas, fried plantains, and salad/beans/sour cream. I've tried the chicken, cheese, and zucchini/onion/cheese pupusas and really liked them all. The chicken is probably my favorite of the three. I've also tried the avocado salad and its incredibly filling and tasty."
712,"My favourite papusa and plantanos restaurant in the East Bay. Service, ambiance, quality of food and price met my expectation."
713,"Absolutely delicious and authentic pupusas here! My husband's family is Salvadorean so I know good pupusas when I see them. We got there a little later than our reservation and they were still very accommodating and served us fast. Ordered the Plato Tipico with One Revuelta and One Queso pupusa. They did not disappoint! We also tried their Pastelitos as an appetizer and they were so big, and delicious as well. Highly recommend this Salvadorean restaurant!"
714,"YUMMM! I've never had Salvadorian food until trying this place and now there's no going back for me. Location: It's right at the heart of University St so street parking can be a pain. There's a parking lot behind El Burro but it does get packed. If you're lucky though, you can find some street parking in the areas around university. Service: It looks small on the outside but inside it's quite large. I usually get seated really quickly regardless of how big of a group I come with. However, it can take some time for them to bring you water/refill it and for your order to get to your table once you order. Price: Some dishes can be pretty pricey but the reason to come here is for the pupusas! I think that when I first started coming here they were $2.5 and might have raised to $2.75. Food: My go tos are the ruvuelta and bean and cheese. I usually order only 2 since they're so filling! I always pair them with plantains too. YUMMM. With your meal they bring you some sauce and slaw. I believe there are two levels of the sauce, they usually bring you the milder one but if you ask they have a spicier version. I tend to finish a whole bottle when I go with friends. lol. Overall, a Berkeley gem that not only provides delicious food, but at a decent price."
715,"Got pupusas (the cheese and squash blossom and the cheese and beans) with fried plantains. It was really good! Will definitely be coming back again, and recommend it to anyone interested in an affordable, filling, and delicious meal!"
716,"Located near many different restaurants near the ""college b-town"" area . Small waiting area in front waiting to be seated but quick turn around service (larger tables in rear). I order the shrimp and steak  x convo with rice and the plate was big enough to share. I ordered the sangria which they ran out fruit for but got a double portion for it and it was still very good"
717,First time eating here and eating El Savadorian food. Food was real fresh and so good. Pupusas were so delicious. The bean and sour cream were so creamy.  Loved the plantains.Great service!! Will be going back soon!!
718,"The menu at Platano has plenty of options from light soups to dense plates. Food: I ordered the Ensalada de Aguacate (avocado), which was healthily portioned, vibrant, and aesthetically pleasing. The grilled chicken had a few fried pieces that were too charred for my liking, in other words burnt. I enjoyed the vinaigrette as it countered the creamy avocado, creating a nice balance. The two-piece pupusa combo plate was filling; one pupusa was filled with cheese and the other with pork and beans, the plate came with a few sides. The pupusas were warm on the interior and lightly fried on the outside, however the flavor was lacking and the cheese didn't quite melt enough. They had a microwave textural feel to them and were lacking freshness. We smothered them with crema, but I recommend topping it off with the coleslaw mix to allow the acidity to cut through the richness of the crema. Service: Friendly, but a bit slow. Our food took a while, fortunately we weren't starving.Ambiance: Large and casual restaurant with plenty of seating to accommodate large parties. Price: Most plates ranged from $-$, seafood dishes on the pricier end. Overall: The food was fair in taste and quality could've been better; nice service with a casual ambiance."
719,"I'm from El Salvador and I make the trip from SF to Berkeley to eat here. The food is on point. The decor is nice and the service is efficient. Their ensalada drink could use more fruit in it. Try salpicón, a chilled dish that you don't find everywhere. Pupusas de queso con loroco are yummy!"
720,"Came here last night after some recommendations from my family and loved it!As soon as we walked in the door, a waiter approached us and sat us down immediately. It was pretty crowded too, so this was great customer service. The service throughout our entire time there was great and I have no complaints!The food was amazing. I was born in El Salvador, so I know Salvadoran food when I taste it. Let me say this is true Salvadoran food. I ordered the pupusas with cheese and beans, and they were perfect! Abundance in size, not greasy, and a perfect blend of cheese and beans. I also ordered the horchata and it was good, a little too sweet for my liking but true Salvadoran horchata (tastes a little different than Mexican horchata for those of you unfamiliar.) My fiancée ordered the platillo típico which comes with two pupusas of your choice and rice and beans and he loved it too. My parents ordered a combination of the chicken sandwich, corn tamales, and yucca. I tried a little bit of everything and it satisfied all my cravings!If you are in the area, please do yourself a favor and come to this place. They have such a large variety of dishes to choose from and they depict Salvadoran cuisine to perfection!"
721,"Salvadoran restaurant. ...simple decore. Would rate food 4 stars, service 4 stars.....but bathroom so filthy had to drop overall rating.Dinner :  Pupusas 1 veggie 1 pork & cheese Delious!!! added there homemade slaw...Delicious treat. 5 star.Corn tamales. ..1 steamed , 1fried...Fried Tilapia platter with rice & platanos...yummy food."

Platano is my to-go-to place for comforting and delicious food; however, on my last visit there, I saw that they had risen the price for their pupusas. It was $2.50 for a pupusa but now, it's $2.90. For a black bean only pupusa, that's a little steep. I've been to places in San Jose that charge $1.50 per pupusa of the same size, so I feel kind of salty about the price increase. I'll continue to frequent Platano, but I hope they don't raise their prices again; otherwise, it's time to find another pupusaría."
747,"Dependable, nourishing Salvadorian fare served in a cozy, homey space in downtown Berkeley. The homey feel extends to the cooking here, which feels quite authentic. The carne desilada, for example, was a melange of pan-fried crispy shredded beef, eggs, tomato, onions, and bell peppers. Meanwhile, a glass of horchata was refreshing - not too sweet, but not bland - although it was full of ice. Service is courteous here, although as other reviewers have noted, it can take a while for things to come out. Nevertheless, if you want Latin American fare that's not expensive given what you get, not to mention dishes that won't feel like they're busting your gut, Platano is a solid choice."
748,"And we are back again at this selicious place. For those that may want some guidance on other than Pupusas, try the Salpicon with casamiento and sour cream..."
749,"This. Place. Is. Bomb. It's rare that a whole table will agree on one opinion about a restaurant, but no one had any complaints and everyone absolutely loved their food (see reference photo #1.  Total inhalation) Prices are super reasonable (especially for the quality of food you're getting) and portions are quite generous. I ordered the potato stew with re fried beans and a salad and everything was perfect. The stew wasn't as thick as traditional American stews but it packed a punch- seasoned well, full of flavor, super tender and still incredibly filling even without the hearty consistency I'm used to. Beans were awesome (I'm a sucker for re fried beans) and the salad added a nice fresh crunch to my whole meal (the citrusy dressing was a refreshing plus). Everyone at my table ate in silence because we couldn't be bothered with conversation when we were having a tastebud fiesta in our mouths."
750,"VEGAN REVIEW!So apparently, the black bean pupusas are vegan! I have been eating here for years (former Cal student) and I did not know this. I also order the Avocado Salad (no chips, no cheese, dressing on the side) which is also vegan. I imagine the fried plantains are also vegan. Overall, delicious food!"
751,"Pupusaaaaaaas!!!! Everytime I come here the pupusas are a must. I would recommend coming during lunch hours (11-2:30, I think) because they have $10 lunch plate specials which are some combination of 1-2 pupusas, fried plantains, and salad/beans/sour cream. I've tried the chicken, cheese, and zucchini/onion/cheese pupusas and really liked them all. The chicken is probably my favorite of the three. I've also tried the avocado salad and its incredibly filling and tasty."
752,"My favourite papusa and plantanos restaurant in the East Bay. Service, ambiance, quality of food and price met my expectation."
753,"Absolutely delicious and authentic pupusas here! My husband's family is Salvadorean so I know good pupusas when I see them. We got there a little later than our reservation and they were still very accommodating and served us fast. Ordered the Plato Tipico with One Revuelta and One Queso pupusa. They did not disappoint! We also tried their Pastelitos as an appetizer and they were so big, and delicious as well. Highly recommend this Salvadorean restaurant!"
754,"YUMMM! I've never had Salvadorian food until trying this place and now there's no going back for me. Location: It's right at the heart of University St so street parking can be a pain. There's a parking lot behind El Burro but it does get packed. If you're lucky though, you can find some street parking in the areas around university. Service: It looks small on the outside but inside it's quite large. I usually get seated really quickly regardless of how big of a group I come with. However, it can take some time for them to bring you water/refill it and for your order to get to your table once you order. Price: Some dishes can be pretty pricey but the reason to come here is for the pupusas! I think that when I first started coming here they were $2.5 and might have raised to $2.75. Food: My go tos are the ruvuelta and bean and cheese. I usually order only 2 since they're so filling! I always pair them with plantains too. YUMMM. With your meal they bring you some sauce and slaw. I believe there are two levels of the sauce, they usually bring you the milder one but if you ask they have a spicier version. I tend to finish a whole bottle when I go with friends. lol. Overall, a Berkeley gem that not only provides delicious food, but at a decent price."
755,"Got pupusas (the cheese and squash blossom and the cheese and beans) with fried plantains. It was really good! Will definitely be coming back again, and recommend it to anyone interested in an affordable, filling, and delicious meal!"
756,"Located near many different restaurants near the ""college b-town"" area . Small waiting area in front waiting to be seated but quick turn around service (larger tables in rear). I order the shrimp and steak  x convo with rice and the plate was big enough to share. I ordered the sangria which they ran out fruit for but got a double portion for it and it was still very good"
757,First time eating here and eating El Savadorian food. Food was real fresh and so good. Pupusas were so delicious. The bean and sour cream were so creamy.  Loved the plantains.Great service!! Will be going back soon!!
758,"The menu at Platano has plenty of options from light soups to dense plates. Food: I ordered the Ensalada de Aguacate (avocado), which was healthily portioned, vibrant, and aesthetically pleasing. The grilled chicken had a few fried pieces that were too charred for my liking, in other words burnt. I enjoyed the vinaigrette as it countered the creamy avocado, creating a nice balance. The two-piece pupusa combo plate was filling; one pupusa was filled with cheese and the other with pork and beans, the plate came with a few sides. The pupusas were warm on the interior and lightly fried on the outside, however the flavor was lacking and the cheese didn't quite melt enough. They had a microwave textural feel to them and were lacking freshness. We smothered them with crema, but I recommend topping it off with the coleslaw mix to allow the acidity to cut through the richness of the crema. Service: Friendly, but a bit slow. Our food took a while, fortunately we weren't starving.Ambiance: Large and casual restaurant with plenty of seating to accommodate large parties. Price: Most plates ranged from $-$, seafood dishes on the pricier end. Overall: The food was fair in taste and quality could've been better; nice service with a casual ambiance."
759,"I'm from El Salvador and I make the trip from SF to Berkeley to eat here. The food is on point. The decor is nice and the service is efficient. Their ensalada drink could use more fruit in it. Try salpicón, a chilled dish that you don't find everywhere. Pupusas de queso con loroco are yummy!"
760,"Came here last night after some recommendations from my family and loved it!As soon as we walked in the door, a waiter approached us and sat us down immediately. It was pretty crowded too, so this was great customer service. The service throughout our entire time there was great and I have no complaints!The food was amazing. I was born in El Salvador, so I know Salvadoran food when I taste it. Let me say this is true Salvadoran food. I ordered the pupusas with cheese and beans, and they were perfect! Abundance in size, not greasy, and a perfect blend of cheese and beans. I also ordered the horchata and it was good, a little too sweet for my liking but true Salvadoran horchata (tastes a little different than Mexican horchata for those of you unfamiliar.) My fiancée ordered the platillo típico which comes with two pupusas of your choice and rice and beans and he loved it too. My parents ordered a combination of the chicken sandwich, corn tamales, and yucca. I tried a little bit of everything and it satisfied all my cravings!If you are in the area, please do yourself a favor and come to this place. They have such a large variety of dishes to choose from and they depict Salvadoran cuisine to perfection!"
761,"Salvadoran restaurant. ...simple decore. Would rate food 4 stars, service 4 stars.....but bathroom so filthy had to drop overall rating.Dinner :  Pupusas 1 veggie 1 pork & cheese Delious!!! added there homemade slaw...Delicious treat. 5 star.Corn tamales. ..1 steamed , 1fried...Fried Tilapia platter with rice & platanos...yummy food."
762,"I love their pupusas and mangonada!I think they are very reasonably priced, $9.99 lunch menu.They are very accomodating for call-in orders.  I like to call my order in as I drive to the restaurant because I anm limited on lunch time and I like to get in before hteir lunch rush.I love their chicken and cheese pupusa, atol de elote beverage, and mangonada.Their entire menu looks delicious, but every time I visit I order the same thing, haha.I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is seeking delicious food!"
763,"Found Platano thanks to good ol' Yelp, and thank goodness I did because it was absolutely delicious.Came in with some friends for dinner and was immediately sat down. When looking over the menu, I realized that their lunch and dinner options were different instead of being the same and having dinner cost a bit more. This definitely surprised me because I feel like I don't see it often at casual restaurants such as Platano! The only thing that really seemed to be calling my name was #2 on the lunch menu which was two pupusas of your choice with a side avocado salad. I asked if I could order this for my dinner, and they said it was no problem but I would be charged more. I happily obliged :)I decided on the Revuelta (fried pork) and Queso y Loroco (Salvadoran flower). Both pupusas were phenomenal, perfect little pockets of heaven. It was only my second time having the food, but I feel confident in saying that these are some of the best I'll ever have in my life time. The salad was a great addition and balance of greens too, so I'm super thankful they allowed me to get this lunch item during dinner.All in all, delicious and good choice for a meal if you're in berkeley :)"
764,"I wasn't a fan the first time I went here. But after my last visit, I can safely say this is a great place for lunch or dinner if you ever find yourself on University Ave. From the outside, it doesn't seem to be that big of a restaurant. But walking in, there are a good amount of tables, with the restaurant extending to the back -- perfect for groups. The atmosphere is a little dingy, but lively nonetheless with paintings and decor to match the Latin American theme. For lunch, there are multiple options of combos that one can choose from pupusas, plantains, tamales,  side salad, and  sour cream and beans. The combinations are endless, and will satisfy those who want to try a bit of everything. My plate came with two pupusas, chicken tamales, and pickled vegetables. I got the revuelta pupusas which was filled with crispy tender pork, and cheese and also the beef and cheese. Essentially, they were a fried stuffed corn masa tortilla with meat and cheese inside. Alone, they were a bit bland with not a lot of seasoning but with a splash of hot sauce and some pickled vegetables the pupusas tasted much better. The chicken tamales was nothing special, but again with the some hot sauce and pickled vegetables it was really good. My friend got a side of sour cream and beans which i regret not getting, since dipping the pupusas in the sides made it even better!Overall, the prices are reasonable for the quality of food and portions are more than generous. My only complaint would be the service as it took over 30 mins to receive our food when it wasn't even that busy. If you never had El Salvadorian food, its a must try!"
765,"This was my second time coming to Platano, and it definitely didn't disappoint. The first time, I came for dinner, but this time it was for lunch. The vibe was a little different. There were more people during lunchtime, and the whole place felt livelier and brighter. Both my friend and I loved what we got the first time we came here, so we skipped over the lunch specials in favor of their full menu so that we could re-experience the deliciousness we remembered. I ordered the Albondigas, essentially meatballs in some kind of tomato sauce. The dish comes with two sides, so I ordered casamientos (a fried mixture of rice and black beans) and platanos (can't come to Platano without ordering platanos!). I noticed that on their dinner menu, platanos is not a side that is offered, which is a shame because they added a really nice balance to the meal as a whole. The meatballs were delicious - a good texture and perfectly seasoned. As for the sides, I definitely recommend casamientos and platanos. The casamientos are a more interesting version of rice, essentially, and the platanos added a bit of sweetness to the dish, which was perfect for me since I have a massive sweet tooth.My friend and I also ordered a papusa to share, which is essentially a stuffed corn masa tortilla. We chose the chicharron (fried pork) papusa, since it seemed to be The Thing to order here. I don't know if I would order the papusa again, but I'm glad I tried it. The breading was too thick for me and the filling wasn't that exciting. Service was okay, but we had to work a little bit to get their attention for the bill.Still, I'll definitely be coming back here next time!"

I believe there are two levels of the sauce, they usually bring you the milder one but if you ask they have a spicier version. I tend to finish a whole bottle when I go with friends. lol. Overall, a Berkeley gem that not only provides delicious food, but at a decent price."
795,"Got pupusas (the cheese and squash blossom and the cheese and beans) with fried plantains. It was really good! Will definitely be coming back again, and recommend it to anyone interested in an affordable, filling, and delicious meal!"
796,"Located near many different restaurants near the ""college b-town"" area . Small waiting area in front waiting to be seated but quick turn around service (larger tables in rear). I order the shrimp and steak  x convo with rice and the plate was big enough to share. I ordered the sangria which they ran out fruit for but got a double portion for it and it was still very good"
797,First time eating here and eating El Savadorian food. Food was real fresh and so good. Pupusas were so delicious. The bean and sour cream were so creamy.  Loved the plantains.Great service!! Will be going back soon!!
798,"The menu at Platano has plenty of options from light soups to dense plates. Food: I ordered the Ensalada de Aguacate (avocado), which was healthily portioned, vibrant, and aesthetically pleasing. The grilled chicken had a few fried pieces that were too charred for my liking, in other words burnt. I enjoyed the vinaigrette as it countered the creamy avocado, creating a nice balance. The two-piece pupusa combo plate was filling; one pupusa was filled with cheese and the other with pork and beans, the plate came with a few sides. The pupusas were warm on the interior and lightly fried on the outside, however the flavor was lacking and the cheese didn't quite melt enough. They had a microwave textural feel to them and were lacking freshness. We smothered them with crema, but I recommend topping it off with the coleslaw mix to allow the acidity to cut through the richness of the crema. Service: Friendly, but a bit slow. Our food took a while, fortunately we weren't starving.Ambiance: Large and casual restaurant with plenty of seating to accommodate large parties. Price: Most plates ranged from $-$, seafood dishes on the pricier end. Overall: The food was fair in taste and quality could've been better; nice service with a casual ambiance."
799,"I'm from El Salvador and I make the trip from SF to Berkeley to eat here. The food is on point. The decor is nice and the service is efficient. Their ensalada drink could use more fruit in it. Try salpicón, a chilled dish that you don't find everywhere. Pupusas de queso con loroco are yummy!"
800,"Came here last night after some recommendations from my family and loved it!As soon as we walked in the door, a waiter approached us and sat us down immediately. It was pretty crowded too, so this was great customer service. The service throughout our entire time there was great and I have no complaints!The food was amazing. I was born in El Salvador, so I know Salvadoran food when I taste it. Let me say this is true Salvadoran food. I ordered the pupusas with cheese and beans, and they were perfect! Abundance in size, not greasy, and a perfect blend of cheese and beans. I also ordered the horchata and it was good, a little too sweet for my liking but true Salvadoran horchata (tastes a little different than Mexican horchata for those of you unfamiliar.) My fiancée ordered the platillo típico which comes with two pupusas of your choice and rice and beans and he loved it too. My parents ordered a combination of the chicken sandwich, corn tamales, and yucca. I tried a little bit of everything and it satisfied all my cravings!If you are in the area, please do yourself a favor and come to this place. They have such a large variety of dishes to choose from and they depict Salvadoran cuisine to perfection!"
801,"Salvadoran restaurant. ...simple decore. Would rate food 4 stars, service 4 stars.....but bathroom so filthy had to drop overall rating.Dinner :  Pupusas 1 veggie 1 pork & cheese Delious!!! added there homemade slaw...Delicious treat. 5 star.Corn tamales. ..1 steamed , 1fried...Fried Tilapia platter with rice & platanos...yummy food."
802,"I love their pupusas and mangonada!I think they are very reasonably priced, $9.99 lunch menu.They are very accomodating for call-in orders.  I like to call my order in as I drive to the restaurant because I anm limited on lunch time and I like to get in before hteir lunch rush.I love their chicken and cheese pupusa, atol de elote beverage, and mangonada.Their entire menu looks delicious, but every time I visit I order the same thing, haha.I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who is seeking delicious food!"
803,"Found Platano thanks to good ol' Yelp, and thank goodness I did because it was absolutely delicious.Came in with some friends for dinner and was immediately sat down. When looking over the menu, I realized that their lunch and dinner options were different instead of being the same and having dinner cost a bit more. This definitely surprised me because I feel like I don't see it often at casual restaurants such as Platano! The only thing that really seemed to be calling my name was #2 on the lunch menu which was two pupusas of your choice with a side avocado salad. I asked if I could order this for my dinner, and they said it was no problem but I would be charged more. I happily obliged :)I decided on the Revuelta (fried pork) and Queso y Loroco (Salvadoran flower). Both pupusas were phenomenal, perfect little pockets of heaven. It was only my second time having the food, but I feel confident in saying that these are some of the best I'll ever have in my life time. The salad was a great addition and balance of greens too, so I'm super thankful they allowed me to get this lunch item during dinner.All in all, delicious and good choice for a meal if you're in berkeley :)"
804,"I wasn't a fan the first time I went here. But after my last visit, I can safely say this is a great place for lunch or dinner if you ever find yourself on University Ave. From the outside, it doesn't seem to be that big of a restaurant. But walking in, there are a good amount of tables, with the restaurant extending to the back -- perfect for groups. The atmosphere is a little dingy, but lively nonetheless with paintings and decor to match the Latin American theme. For lunch, there are multiple options of combos that one can choose from pupusas, plantains, tamales,  side salad, and  sour cream and beans. The combinations are endless, and will satisfy those who want to try a bit of everything. My plate came with two pupusas, chicken tamales, and pickled vegetables. I got the revuelta pupusas which was filled with crispy tender pork, and cheese and also the beef and cheese. Essentially, they were a fried stuffed corn masa tortilla with meat and cheese inside. Alone, they were a bit bland with not a lot of seasoning but with a splash of hot sauce and some pickled vegetables the pupusas tasted much better. The chicken tamales was nothing special, but again with the some hot sauce and pickled vegetables it was really good. My friend got a side of sour cream and beans which i regret not getting, since dipping the pupusas in the sides made it even better!Overall, the prices are reasonable for the quality of food and portions are more than generous. My only complaint would be the service as it took over 30 mins to receive our food when it wasn't even that busy. If you never had El Salvadorian food, its a must try!"
805,"This was my second time coming to Platano, and it definitely didn't disappoint. The first time, I came for dinner, but this time it was for lunch. The vibe was a little different. There were more people during lunchtime, and the whole place felt livelier and brighter. Both my friend and I loved what we got the first time we came here, so we skipped over the lunch specials in favor of their full menu so that we could re-experience the deliciousness we remembered. I ordered the Albondigas, essentially meatballs in some kind of tomato sauce. The dish comes with two sides, so I ordered casamientos (a fried mixture of rice and black beans) and platanos (can't come to Platano without ordering platanos!). I noticed that on their dinner menu, platanos is not a side that is offered, which is a shame because they added a really nice balance to the meal as a whole. The meatballs were delicious - a good texture and perfectly seasoned. As for the sides, I definitely recommend casamientos and platanos. The casamientos are a more interesting version of rice, essentially, and the platanos added a bit of sweetness to the dish, which was perfect for me since I have a massive sweet tooth.My friend and I also ordered a papusa to share, which is essentially a stuffed corn masa tortilla. We chose the chicharron (fried pork) papusa, since it seemed to be The Thing to order here. I don't know if I would order the papusa again, but I'm glad I tried it. The breading was too thick for me and the filling wasn't that exciting. Service was okay, but we had to work a little bit to get their attention for the bill.Still, I'll definitely be coming back here next time!"
806,"VEGAN GLUTEN FREE REVIEW:I love Platano, or rather, their black bean pupusas, curtido, and salsa. The flavors are amazing and they're vegan and gluten free! Platano is my to-go-to place for comforting and delicious food; however, on my last visit there, I saw that they had risen the price for their pupusas. It was $2.50 for a pupusa but now, it's $2.90. For a black bean only pupusa, that's a little steep. I've been to places in San Jose that charge $1.50 per pupusa of the same size, so I feel kind of salty about the price increase. I'll continue to frequent Platano, but I hope they don't raise their prices again; otherwise, it's time to find another pupusaría."
807,"Dependable, nourishing Salvadorian fare served in a cozy, homey space in downtown Berkeley. The homey feel extends to the cooking here, which feels quite authentic. The carne desilada, for example, was a melange of pan-fried crispy shredded beef, eggs, tomato, onions, and bell peppers. Meanwhile, a glass of horchata was refreshing - not too sweet, but not bland - although it was full of ice. Service is courteous here, although as other reviewers have noted, it can take a while for things to come out. Nevertheless, if you want Latin American fare that's not expensive given what you get, not to mention dishes that won't feel like they're busting your gut, Platano is a solid choice."
808,"And we are back again at this selicious place. For those that may want some guidance on other than Pupusas, try the Salpicon with casamiento and sour cream..."
809,"This. Place. Is. Bomb. It's rare that a whole table will agree on one opinion about a restaurant, but no one had any complaints and everyone absolutely loved their food (see reference photo #1.  Total inhalation) Prices are super reasonable (especially for the quality of food you're getting) and portions are quite generous. I ordered the potato stew with re fried beans and a salad and everything was perfect. The stew wasn't as thick as traditional American stews but it packed a punch- seasoned well, full of flavor, super tender and still incredibly filling even without the hearty consistency I'm used to. Beans were awesome (I'm a sucker for re fried beans) and the salad added a nice fresh crunch to my whole meal (the citrusy dressing was a refreshing plus). Everyone at my table ate in silence because we couldn't be bothered with conversation when we were having a tastebud fiesta in our mouths."
810,"VEGAN REVIEW!So apparently, the black bean pupusas are vegan! I have been eating here for years (former Cal student) and I did not know this. I also order the Avocado Salad (no chips, no cheese, dressing on the side) which is also vegan. I imagine the fried plantains are also vegan. Overall, delicious food!"
811,"Pupusaaaaaaas!!!! Everytime I come here the pupusas are a must. I would recommend coming during lunch hours (11-2:30, I think) because they have $10 lunch plate specials which are some combination of 1-2 pupusas, fried plantains, and salad/beans/sour cream. I've tried the chicken, cheese, and zucchini/onion/cheese pupusas and really liked them all. The chicken is probably my favorite of the three. I've also tried the avocado salad and its incredibly filling and tasty."
812,"My favourite papusa and plantanos restaurant in the East Bay. Service, ambiance, quality of food and price met my expectation."
813,"Absolutely delicious and authentic pupusas here! My husband's family is Salvadorean so I know good pupusas when I see them. We got there a little later than our reservation and they were still very accommodating and served us fast. Ordered the Plato Tipico with One Revuelta and One Queso pupusa. They did not disappoint! We also tried their Pastelitos as an appetizer and they were so big, and delicious as well. Highly recommend this Salvadorean restaurant!"
814,"YUMMM! I've never had Salvadorian food until trying this place and now there's no going back for me. Location: It's right at the heart of University St so street parking can be a pain. There's a parking lot behind El Burro but it does get packed. If you're lucky though, you can find some street parking in the areas around university. Service: It looks small on the outside but inside it's quite large. I usually get seated really quickly regardless of how big of a group I come with. However, it can take some time for them to bring you water/refill it and for your order to get to your table once you order. Price: Some dishes can be pretty pricey but the reason to come here is for the pupusas! I think that when I first started coming here they were $2.5 and might have raised to $2.75.
